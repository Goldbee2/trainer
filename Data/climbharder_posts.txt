Dave MacLeod's treatment for fingery injuries contradicts everything I thought I knew http://www.onlineclimbingcoach.blogspot.ca/2012/03/injuries-problem-with-lay-off.html
How to beat him? No, not with a paddle. See, I climb with my husband (V2), and while that's all fine and dandy, he's an entire foot and 3 inches taller than me. We started climbing about a month apart, and I am determined to kick his butt. I know he has some advantage by being taller and being able to pass some holds. (I admit, I generally try to avoid things that get me into a competitive spirit... but this is climbing. I must surpass.)
What, as a female, would benefit me to train on that will give me some kind of boost to myself past the V1s and destroy his soul? Should I focus on some more upper body strength because I am naturally lacking? Should I focus on matching? 
Any advice is super. Please, thanks.
Downclimbing What are the benefits of down climbing a route? I am currently stuck at a 5.10 and was told down climbing would help.
If footwork is so important, why am i not strengthening my feet/toes as well as my fingers? I've been browsing climbit and climbharder for a while and i love all the awesome training advice, BUT i have never seen a single post about strength of feet! i know personally my big toes will be strained and sore after a long day of climbing. i try to stretch them before and after climbing but they are certainly getting a work out! I wear Katana laces and have tried Futuras once. I am certain that my feet are not strong enough for the Futuras to be even worth climbing in again. I personally while resting on small feet will take my weight on my upper body to give my sore toes a break. Toe pump?  I see so many posts about upper body strength, strengthen your core, finger exercises, etc... a few on improving your footwork, but not on improving your feet. What are your guys thoughts on developing good strong feet? i know climb more... but give me anything!!

tldr: We have great feat of strength, we need great strength of Feet!!
Coming back after about 7 or 8 weeks off Between buying a house, a minor injury, some vacation time, and work picking up, I've been climbing once in the past couple months. Today I got back into the gym for the second time this week, and man it's feeling good!

I just want to encourage anyone who's had life interfere with climbing. I'm flailing pretty hard but can feel the cob webs starting to shake off.

It'll still be a couple weeks before I can get the time to climb outside, but I can't wait!

Stay positive and get back at it - I had started to forget how much I loved to climb!
Niel Gresham designed a training program for you. 3 part series in Rock and Ice [Part 1](http://www.rockandice.com/lates-news/building-a-better-climber-part-one)  
[Part 2](http://www.rockandice.com/lates-news/building-a-better-climber-part-2)  
[Part 3](http://www.rockandice.com/lates-news/building-a-better-climber-part-3)

Sorry if this has been posted before. I just found it and I'm super excited to start!

Edit:  
Noticed a few inconsistencies, and emailed their web editor about it. Mostly the problem is the lack of descriptions of what "extreme planks" and "iron crosses" are. Anybody know what they are talking about?

Also, just noticed it is actually a 7 part series that is currently ongoing.
Pausing on each hold. Hey, just thought I'd share a little exercise that's helped me a fair bit.

The idea is that you have to tap a hold 3-4 times at one second intervals before you're allowed to use it. It's similar to climbing in slow motion, but you're allowed to wiggle around however you like, just as long as you keep tapping. 

It's really helped me with body awareness, and static strength/balance. It also really forces you to use good technique to hold some very awkward poses.

Anyways, I'm not sure if this is a common thing, but very few people I've spoken to know it, so I thought I'd share just in case!
Should we develop an FAQ for the sidebar? It seems to me that this sub either cyclically or more recently has gotten an influx of climbers asking the same sorts of questions. To whom I say, welcome! I hope you manage to train well, avoid injury, and ultimately climb harder.

Given that most of us have different backgrounds, it's inevitable that some of us will disagree regarding training specifics. Repetition, load, volume, or even types of exercise.

But there is a greater consensus on other, more basic questions, and it might save time for everyone involved if those answers were made clear and easily accessible.

Perhaps the biggest example is "I've been climbing for less than a year and cannot seem to push past V[x]; how should I be training?" Below a certain threshold, the answer is almost always the same: a larger volume of attentive climbing--because climbing is a skills-based sport, and motor skill development requires practice.

Another common one is "I've injured [a distal extremity e.g. a finger]; what can I do to make sure I come back strong?" The answer is almost always: strengthen your core.

We might even include recommendations for books that have more or less become canon. SCC being the chief example.

My thinking is that by answering the bigger, more general questions up front, newer redditors will have an idea of what to search for ("Okay; I need to look for core exercises"), or will be able to write more specific questions that lead to more helpful discussion immediately.

Opinions?
How to Climb This and That: Shaping Your Approach to Climbing I recently wrote a blog about how I have molded the way I approach climbing. No, it is not full of exercises or training tips. But I think for some members of the group you might find my experience an inspiration as you deal with plateaus, different members of the community, and your own personal capabilities and limitations. If this doesn't sound interesting, don't click the link below (btw, its just over 2 pages long).

Focusing on the hips and its effect on technique. Hi everyone!  I just wrote 2 blog posts about using the hips more effectively while climbing and I wanted to share them.  I've noticed there are a ton of internet resources regarding hangboard workouts and things of that nature, but there's very little discussion on effective use of the hips and strengthening the posterior chain in a way that is useful to climbing.  

I've personally made huge gains by taking a step away from the constant hangboarding and focusing on body awareness, and I hope maybe others will benefit from a slightly different approach to improving their climbing.

Foam Rolling and Self Massage for Climbers Hey everyone!  I just wrote a new post about self myofascial release for climbers.  It seems pretty common for people to train hard, but not focus on the recovery side of things.  I thought I would share my post climbing massage "routine" that has played a huge part in preventing shoulder pain and elbow tendonitis.  Let me know what you think!

Take care!
Great finger/wrist/forearm warm up. Hi everyone.  I thought I would share this video I found a while ago (not mine).  It's great to use as a warm up, cool down, or during the day to get blood flow going through the hands and forearms.  You could even use it as a rehab after an injury since it's so low intensity.

Enjoy!

**Disclosure:** I work here, but thought the workout is worth sharing.
I made a web app to track indoor climbs (TrackYourClimb.com) Since I've started climbing (mainly indoors), I've always wanted an easy way to track indoor climbs to see my climbing progression, but I couldn't find anything that worked well. So the past couple months I've been building a website to track indoor climbing workouts and monitor progress--you can check it out here: www.trackyourclimb.com

Ways to use it:
1) Login to the website at the gym and update your climbs as you climb them. Then at the end, submit your workout.
or
2) Climb at the gym, remember what you climbed, and input it back home on your computer

Eventually, as more people log their climbs over time, we'll be able to answer questions such as:
1) On average, how many climbs at a certain grade do you climb before breaking into a new grade
2) How does climbing performance change with gender/age/height/etc.
3) Gym-to-gym variation in grading

Let me know if you have ideas, suggestions, criticisms or are interested in the project. I'm actively working on it and adding/fixing things every week in my free time.
I made a web tool that generates random training sessions for rock climbing (link in text) You can access it here: http://baves.net/generator/

It lets you select what disciplines (boulder, lead, top rope) and what equipment you want to use, as well as whether to focus on power, endurance, or both, and set the length of the session.

Hopefully this will be of use to someone. If you have any suggestions or feedback please let me know so I can improve it in the future!
Question for Climbers climbing V9+ within 5 years Hi guys,

I'm a very motivated, masochistic climber/trainer who is trying to understand a bit more about what and how some climbers are able to get so strong so quickly. 

I climb with some really strong climbers at my gym (The Cliffs in LIC), and there are some climbers that have been climbing only for a few years that climb incredibly strong. 

I guess what I am wondering is how did your progression come? What did you do to get there? How often did you climb?

What I have observed is the really strong climbers are usually climbing 4 - 5 times a week. Is the constant stressing of the fingers the reason? How do you avoid injury? Etc.

Hope to hear back from some of you all
A talk with Adam Ondra About...Training, diet, competition and future goals From the [Trainingbeta.com website](https://www.trainingbeta.com/media/tbp-017-adam-ondra-things-training/?portfolioID=3838)

Why you aren't getting stronger I know this will get tanked but I feel like it needs to be said. 

The reason you aren't getting stronger is because you don't really want to get stronger.

Half the posts in this subreddit are looking for an easy answer to get stronger. Want to know how you get stronger? You train. It is that simple. Yet I am constantly amazed at the complexity of some of these training routines and their misguided attempts at sneaking into harder grades.

Climbing is a sport that requires years of effort and focused drive. You need to be whiling to be in the gym every week. You don't get to take a couple years off here and there. You don't get to put on 30lbs of fat and continue to climb hard grades. Likewise you don't enter the gym at 30% bf and expect to climb hard. 

The only way to climb harder is to become and athlete. There are people always looking for the get strong quick plan. I train hours a week using specified, researched and calculated methods that I feel are the best. But the reason I progress is I am training hours a week, eat accordingly, recover accordingly and sleep accordingly - every week.

You want a stronger back? Do pull ups consistently and you will get a stronger back. Do pull ups every couple of weeks in no particular order? You will get no where.

Eat, move, recover - always. It's that simple.

And again, I know this will get downvoted to oblivion but it drives me nuts coming here for climbing advice and seeing some of these ridiculous posts that ignore or make an excuse for every person that gives the real advice they need to hear. Get off your ass and train harder.
Cool training video check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcsI23yjkeM&amp;spfreload=10

I'm subbed to you guys on youtube, you guys might find it cool :)
Climb your project more then once. Too often do I see people finish their problems and walk away forever. I truly don't think you are learning as much as you can by only doing it once. There are so many things that you can take away from repeating a problem such as beta improvement and a stronger head game. I've fallen victim to avoiding past sent projects in fear of not being able to send them again. What I've learn is to stop caring about the fear of not sending and to try to refine your movements and try to climb it at clean and controlled as possible. Be prepared to get pissed and angry. Get ready to say "I've done this before I don't know why it's so hard now.". Fuck you might even try to blame others for your failure like greasy holds and someone heating the holds. Your going to get mad which is ok just don't put it on others and yourself. Stop running away from your fear of failing where you ince succeeded and instead face it head on.
Shoulders, Shoulders, Shoulders i recently suffered my first shoulder injury.  i have full ROM but i've got a bit of weakness and pain on shoulder-packed deadhangs.  physio says its likely supraspinatus strain but i remain braced for less optimistic outcomes .  To celebrate, i've rounded up three useful links for the shoulder enthusiast.

Training AMAs Over the last couple of weeks I've been able to arrange an AMA with Eva Lopez sometime later in the year.   In the meantime, I was thinking it might be cool to arrange a couple more.   Maybe ramp up to the Eva Lopez talk?     

Any suggestions?   Comment below and I'll do my best to set it up. 

Cheers!

Power, Fingers, and Sending i've noticed a reoccurring combination of high-end power between medium-sized holds, mediocre finger strength, and intermediate sending capacity.  off the top of my head I can think of at least 5 people who can do 1-4-7 but max out on the fingerboard at rouhgly +10lbs @12mm.  not surprisingly their climbing ability reflects this stark contrast in capacities with most people peaking somewhere between v7 and v9.  

if this sounds like you, then consider a moratorium on campusing.  you don't need it.  especially if you're using medium and large holds.  instead you need to conduct your well-honed locomotion into functional movement and turn your abstract assets into something fungible *outside* of the gym.  to do so you'll first need strong fingers.  

hangboard.  the minutia isn't terribly important, but you need to systematically stress your fingers for a few minutes every week.  start now and never stop.  the only difference between the v7 version of you and the v13 version is several years of fidelity to improving finger strength.  treat it like hydration or vitamins; make it a habit.  
  
once you have strong fingers your next goal is to connect them up, route them back into, onto, and through your power.  DON'T GO BACK TO THE CAMPUS BOARD.  go to the bouldering wall and try moves you can't do.  it is that simple.  moves with bad holds.  long but not necessarily gymnastic.  you're likely not training for the World Cup circuit so stay off the trick problems.  just because something is hard doesn't mean it is useful.  focus instead on problems that feel similar in style to your goal routes.     

you want to learn to grit your teeth and connect impossible sections with the full force of your body.  be mindful, think about each part of your movement, the various roles of each limb, and then set fire to the whole system during your execution.  this isn't training so much as practice; you're becoming powerful (in more ways than simply recruiting fast-twitch fibers) though practice.  the difference for real climbing will be absolutely game changing.  you will no longer wonder if your training will transfer to your project... you know it will because you've intensified your ability to try hard and explicitly tied it back into your body.  **you have practiced climbing hard instead of training to climb hard**.  you've collapsed the difference through steady goal-oriented repetition.  

i promise if you do these things in moderation you will send climbs you previously thought impossible.  again and again and again.*

*until you hit your genetic limit.  /rimshot         

edit: a few more words on the specifics of limit bouldering.  a few adjectives.
Training AMA Update Steve Maisch, Adam Macke (w/ Sofia Bunger), Kris Hampton, Neely Quinn, and Eva Lopez all confirmed.   

Gonna start next month and proceed on into the spring.   I'll start building a new que sometime this winter.   

Pretty excited about these.  Thanks for the all suggestions!
Any interest in a weekly training chat thread? I enjoy the weekly discussion threads on other subs where people post stuff that wouldn't warrant its own topic. Personally, it might help me with training by encouraging me to log and chat about what I'm doing but also in seeing what other people are doing.
15 Years of Trauma: The Injury List A bit of a Cake Day special.   15 years of climbing-related trauma featuring the type of Injury, how it occurred, and how it was resolved.   I'm not a doctor so keep that in mind when perusing my sometimes threadbare rehab methods.   Also note this isn't a laundry list of the ways in which I unraveled my ability to climb.  I'm knocking on the door of v12 this season.  Would I prefer less injury?   Of course.   But the body persists despite the occasional setbacks. 

 **- Grade I/2 AC Joint Sprain** - 30lb curl press with insufficient warmup -bouldered v10 the next day (I wasn't quite sure I was hurt).  Took a week off and started working on internal rotation/mobility issues.  Resolved almost entirely within 8 weeks, but I still have some laxity in the joint. 

**- Tendon Rupture Pinky Finger** - campusing pockets in a roof -6 weeks off with an 8 week gradual return to full strength.

**- A3 Pulley Injury Index, Middle, Ring both hands** -climbing (never from a hangboard or campusing) -varied from no time off and immediate resolution to multi-year projects. 

**- Flexor Unit Strain** -sideways cross-body lunge on a two finger pocket -buddy taped and no pockets for 4 weeks.  Sent the offending problem (with three fingers) 6 weeks post injury. 

**- Latissimus Dorsi Strain** - random front lever -was unable to do a pullup for several months but was able to climb dynamically (sent a 12c in the Bob Marley cave).   Resolved in 4 months.

**- Shoulder Tendonitis**, -greasing the groove with one arms -open can eccentrics and no one arms resolved it in a few weeks

**- Golfers Elbow**-weighted deep lockoff -I tried a layoff and it got progressive worse.   After 8 months I was having trouble driving a car much less climbing.  When I I started actively rehabbing I couldn't hang on a bar.   With eccentrics and slow progressive hangs I was able to climb within 3 months and within a grade of my max ability at 5.

**- Tennis Elbow** -pinching plates - knocked it out with eccentrics in a week.

**- bicep tendonitis** -heavy curls and one arms -stopped doing curls and one arms for a few weeks.

**- de Quervain's** -pinching plates - took forever to get rid of due to the incessant use of thumbs.   I'm not even sure how it resolved ; it just decided to go.

**- supraspinatus strain** -heavy hangs on a tired shoulder -open can eccentrics fixed it in a week, but I tore the AC joint in the same shoulder shortly after so...

**- TFCC strain** -hard climbing open handed  -2 week layoff and wrist strengthening work in a rice bucket.

**- DiP Joint inflammation** -lateral joint tension from deep v-sits coupled with heavy hangs on 6mm edge -eh, I still have a little inflammation, but i'm careful to cycle on and off small holds to help keep it in check.

**- ankle sprain** (both) -gym mishaps - my right ankle has sprained a dozen times and probably needs surgery before I'm much older

**- inguinal hernia** -dragon flag with rotation -I elected not to have surgery and it's been fine for almost two years

**- frostbite big toe** -wandering around boulders with tight shoes for am extended period -this has lingered for a few seasons.   Anything below 50 degrees and my toe looks and feels dead.   Hopefully it's better this season so I can stop babysitting it every time I'm outside.

**TLDR: Climbing can be injurious, but bodies are resilient.  Take care not to get hurt, but know that when you do it's not the end of the line.   I'm basically being held together by force of will... **

Free Weekly Workouts Hi Everyone,



I'm the coach of a (mostly) adult climbing team in Toronto (Canada) that is affectionately called the "B-Team". Our gym has an "Elite" team that includes the types of people who make finals at local, regional, and national events and even a couple of World Cup experienced competitors (such as Sean McColl). The B-Team was created because there was a group of climbers who, although not as strong as the "Elites", still wanted to train, compete and be a part of a team. The team is free to join and as the team's coach, I volunteer my time. Some of the team members have put on women's bouldering clinics and they're even putting on an intro to competing clinic soon.  Nobody makes money off of the team or anything the team does (other than *maybe* a couple of extra day passes get sold when there's a clinic).



Since I'm already typing up and sharing the workouts on Facebook, I thought I would see if this sub might find them useful. The workouts have been planned in such a way that the climbers will get stronger, but also improve their movement skills - so we avoid the hangboard and campus board (some of the more advanced and motivated team members still do those types of workouts on their other training days). Each workout breaks down in to a warm-up (often with some kind of skill focus involved), a climbing-based workout, then additional strength exercises that are performed on the floor, a TRX, or set of rings. 



New workouts are posted every Monday. Today's is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l_jPZiyQuqoDwNTe1IJ8CeJydV9kVfsEoWrfOVY8yik/edit?usp=sharing) while previous workouts can be found on our [public Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/jrhbteam).


If there is interest (ie. people in the sub indicate that this wouldn't be spam), I can try to remember to post workouts here, but it's probably best to just "Like" the FB page if you want to get them regularly.
Training Myths I was thinking recently that it might be a nice idea to have a solid list of training for climbing myths, along with their level of inaccuracy (ranging from disproven, not backed by research, to disagrees with commonly accepted training principals, etc.) and links to articles, papers, etc. debunking the myths. Then perhaps we can collate these links into a real article and put it on the sidebar. Once we start posting a link to the "Top x myths about training for climbing" all over r/climbing and r/bouldering whenever someone parrots something their gym staff told them that makes no fucking sense maybe we can distribute a little more knowledge among the climbing world.

I'll start with my personal favorite:

**Myth:** "Hangboarding when you've been climbing for less than X years will destroy your tendons".

**Inaccuracy level:** Low - This is more of a misnomer than a myth. Isolating your fingers and loading them with more weight than they can handle will destroy your tendons. This can happen on the hangboard, but it could just as easily happen (and often does) on the climbing wall.

**Supporting Evidence:** Basic Logic. Overloading a tendon will cause it to tear and this is not exclusive to hangboarding, it can happen just as easily when you get on a boulder problem that is too hard and crimpy for you. There is no "appropriate amount of time" to be climbing before you can get on the hangboard. For some people it may be never, for others it may be immediately. Most of us are somewhere in-between. The hangboard is a tool that, when used correctly, is perfectly safe regardless of your ability level. Whether or not you should be using the tool is another argument entirely.

I think the arguments that Mark Anderson makes here sums this up nicely.

TLDL: Training Beta Podcast 001 - Carlo Traversi Don't have time to listen?  Still want the information?   Read on as expert paraphraser and note-taking legend /u/Milyoo regales you with all the training tidbits fit to share from the Training Beta podcast series.

[001 Carlo Traversi:](https://www.trainingbeta.com/media/tbp001-talk-carlo-traversi/) 

11 Years Climbing.  140 lbs 5'7" +3 Ape. (DAMN, SON!)  Youth comp climber.  Has done hard sport and boulders.  Has endurance without training.  Midfielder in soccer; background in endurance sports.  Mostly boulders now because...um...he boulders a lot, but he enjoys all climbing.  He boulders 80% alone so the other climbing(s) are bit more difficult due to the limitations of partners.

**Winning**: 5.14c Girl Talk 5 tries.  several v15s.  thinks Hynotized Minds is v16.  He likes big open hand moves and slopers.  Has had lots of finger injuries so he avoids crimps.  Of course, he can crimp, but he prefers thugginess; with holds you can sink your meat hooks into.        

**Failing**:  fails to stay motivated for rigid training programs.  likes to read the body and do whatever feels right, but this might be a weakness of his.   

**Pressure**: is anxious sometimes to make 'news' for sponsorships, but the pressure can be motivating.  Same for comp pressure.  

**Comps**: isolation is constant analysis, but ideally the mind is a blank slate for the actual pulling.  rationalize the variables - purge them - and then go.  if you make a mistake, then you have to quickly move on.

**Fear**: he volumed out the fear with particularly horrifying moments such that everything else seems silly.  has sprained ankles, no big injuries from bouldering falls.  his confidence is calculated.  arrogance is just being crazy.  

**Training:** started climbing at 14.  not taught; just a rogue kid at the gym.  has never had a coach, but learned a lot by watching Kevin Jorgeson.  

trained for the 'extra level' of core (with front levers and situp variations) to keep his feet on better.  also trained his lats with crazy hard lat pulldowns.  

had a big 2012 (sent Jade) where he started "training" pretty seriously.  this included in a day:  projecting inside.  circuits of 30-40 mid-range problems for time.  500-1000 situps on a BOSU ball.  2 reps: 260 lb wide lat pulldown.  4 DAYS A WEEK!!!  

he never expected to climb v15.  he doesn't feel strong, but it mostly feels like everything else has gotten easier.  

tries to climb everyday now.  easier days.  harder days.  some weights.  he feels like 7 days a week is a 'practiced pain' and is very useful when he doesn't have time to rest (projects, comps, etc.)  

**Competitive:** he's not externally competitive.  he's not interested in taking away from other people's accomplishments; especially in the case of downgrading problems.  it's a case of humility.  

**Diet:** diet is huge, but he doesn't do it.  well.  he does.  he's just not hardcore.  he eats good whole food.  natural.  variety.  proteins.  not a lot of carbs (unless he's outside all day).  listens to cravings and it works pretty well for him.  trying to never be full works out well.  food is awesome, but not feeling dumpy is better.

strength to weight ratio is important, but the energy problems are notable.  best he's ever climbed is the heaviest he's been (150 lbs).   

doesn't really do supplements.  used to do protein shakes, but now he does enough meat to get protein.  
average non-training day: 2 eggs, pork sausage.  kombucha midday.  tikka masala 1/2 plate dinner.  

**Booze:** he goes out and drinks more than he cares to admit.  he likes going out socially and partying.  nothing crazy.  a drink almost every night in Boulder.  he can't tell a difference save for when he trains and drinks:  more sore due to dehydration.  he also doesn't drink a week or so before comps.  booze + electrolytes = feel good in the morning.  

He is a serious fun haver!
TLDL: Training Beta Podcast 025 - Steve Maisch Don't have time to listen? Still want the information? Read on as expert paraphraser and note-taking legend /u/Milyoo regales you with all the training tidbits fit to share from the Training Beta podcast series.  

note: I skipped ahead because Steve is our next AMA and I figured this might prove useful for context.  I'll go back and get the rest.  I promise.    

[025 Steve Maisch](https://www.trainingbeta.com/media/tbp-025-steve-maisch/)

Steve is climber out of SLC and an Econ PhD/Professor at the University of Utah.
23 years climbing. 43 years old.  No formal training. Most of what he knows has been acquired with self-experimentation and side-research.  Writes plans and trains some.  Both have helped him accrue more knowledge through expanding his observational pool.

http://www.stevemaischtraining.com/

he began early mid 90's and read Performance Rock Climbing. over the years he's read all the climbing trainers and tried to run analogs from other sports. Bompa for periodized training. Dan John. Mark Twight.  etc. 

his training has evolved such that he has boiled his plan down to a few simple things: fingerboard. rings. training drills. weightroom (less).  the general plan has simplified over the years. 

**barriers**: 90's was lots of sport and bouldering and stuck in the v10/5.13 zone. graduate school forced him to be more efficient, and the subsequent systematic training pushed him into the v13/5.14 range. *"over the hump".* 

**the plan**:  time crunch - perform exercises and then stop.   what that does is focuses the workout rather than just generically climbing.  if you're seriously working on strength gains then you need to focus your efforts.

hangboard.  he has a couple different protocols.  

***10 second max hang***.  determine 1RM and then do 5 hangs with 5' rest.  Narrow down the grips.  **Half crimp, middle two, pinch**.  Keeps you on the basics.  isometric training strengthens within 20 degrees of the trained joint angle so the half crimp covers practically everything.  he uses a Beastmaker, but he prefers the 18 to 20mm edge.  ([Eva Lopez Study](http://en-eva-lopez.blogspot.com/2012/02/frequently-asked-questions-about.html))  Pinch boards are difficult to use because of compression.  he uses pinch blocks instead.

**Notes on the 1RM**: Steven Low (mistakenly refers to him as Chu?) and his work on transposing concentric and eccentric lift times to isometric training; his finding was 4 seconds isometric is your 1RM.  Maisch finds that you often hold for 6 seconds in climbing so that should be your 1RM; he now thinks, however, there is substantial recruitment/strength gain in the following 4 seconds.  his hypothesis is that when we're climbing we're recruiting X number of fibers, but hanging for more than the standard 6" will recruit new fibers. so his 1RM is 10-13 seconds.   (OP's note: 8-10" also ensures you're fully obliterating the ATP-CP system; this is also the rationale for 2-5 minute rests to replenish those stores before obliterating them again)

repeaters are effective but we need some actual research to see how/why.  he prefers 10" max from his experience.  purely anecdotal.  

he does, however, think you should mix up your hang workouts.  something like 3 weeks max hangs - 3 week repeater hybrid (5 hangs - 3 hangs - 1 hangs).  this is how you might move through plateaus.   

**stuff to do on a small home wall:**

hard bouldering.  max bouldering.  3-4 moves.  (really likes the Moon Board because you can't cheat the movement).  Steve Bechtel talks about training as working your motor system and metabolics:  routes are training he glycolytic system and you'll hit a roof (PUN!) wherein you can only do so many moves at X difficulty.  at this juncture most people think they need more endurance, but they actually need more max strength.  if you bump the max up then the moves feel easier and use a different energy system.  you can't do 90% difficulty no matter how fit you get (where fitness is derived from climbing routes) so you have to make 90% moves feel like 70% (or lower generally).     

of course, you still need to strength endurance (the Glycolytic system) - ATP-CP people can perform at higher max strength, but they will wither in 15 seconds.

**how to train strength endurance:**

intervals or tabatas:  20" on 10" off.  45" on 1' off.  start at 1:2 and work down to 1:1 work ratio (you train more strength initially due to more rest).
  
(45 seconds is about 15 moves).  try to OS level or a little harder.  not so bad if you fall off the last one, but you want it to feel hard.  three to five problems ran four times.  

4x4 is more endurance rather than strength.  Intervals are more strength oriented.

not a fan of linear periodization.  train it all.  all the time.  

**Sample Week: strength day - capacity day (high volume) - strength day - strength endurance** 

[ENDURANCE FOCUS](https://www.trainingbeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/strength-endurance.jpg)
[STRENGTH FOCUS](https://www.trainingbeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/strength.jpg) 

the general idea is weeks get harder as time goes on.  easy - medium - hard.  Nonlinear periodized program.  from there you can switch up the focus of the three week blocks along the lines of Strength or Endurance.

**weight room**: he's sort of a fan, but he thinks you want to keep the weight room low volume.  shouldn't take precedence over climbing.  Deadlifts are once a week and can maybe be coupled with fingerboard workout.  you don't want to try to deadlift and then boulder the next day because it absolutely wrecks you.  ideally have additional rest days after.    

deadlift: benefits climbing because it recruits a large amount of muscles.  this is useful because most climbing moves require large scale recruitment.  we also misunderstand the 'core' and omit the posterior chain.  3-5 reps max.  sumo squat might be more appropriate for beginners because it's somewhat safer.

push/press motion

front squats - safer than the back lift (for more reasons than listed in the podcast).

he focuses more on rings because he thinks they're much more applicable.  rings + deadlift and you get a lot of good hormonal benefits due to HgH release.   

**who should do this?** if you're a 5.9 climber then go climb.  if you're reasonably fit you'll get to 5.12 with just climbing.  mid 5.12 you'll maybe look to specific training.  v7/8 for boulderers.  but if you're a 5.13 climber and can't boulder harder than v5 then maybe look for specific strength training.  

**Diet and Bodyweight:** equal parts fat/protein/carbs works well for climbers.  good fats including saturated fats.  bodyweight depends on the individual, but is best done through calorie reduction.  you need to balance recovery and training.  he prefers to focus on getting stronger.
[Futureproofing] Hi, Wanna help build the /r/climbharder FAQ? I'm ready.  

I want this list to be as comprehensive as possible before I start linking back to and perhaps (re)structuring the wiki.  The aim here isn't to derail conversations before they happen, but instead to give people enough information to make novel queries.
[List] A Veteran Climber’s Training Guide 1) Don't get hurt.  

2) Work on movement twice as much as you think you need to, and then work on it more. 

3) Keep your fingers strong.

4) Keep your core strong. 

5) Video yourself climbing and keep a critical eye on your footwork and body positioning.  

6) Use your time efficiently in both the gym and at the crag/boulders. 

7) There is no silver bullet.   Know that your success will come from the polyphonic harmony of events, practices, and luck. 

8) Try to make the process fun and don't get bogged down in the stifling game of results. 

9) Enjoy your life outside of climbing.  A monastic existence might seem necessary to enjoy the spoils of high-end climbing, but it really just makes joy itself monochromatic.  It renders climbing more stressful and probably makes you utterly and completely boring.   Diversify your connections and watch them all flourish. 

10) Try hard.  Yolo.
Train Hard But Smart Vol. I - The Book of Strength for Climbing and Bouldering Hello /r/climbharder!

My name is Nic, I'm a sport scientist, coach and passionate climber from Germany.
Over the past 3 years I have worked on a new book about (strength) training for climbing and bouldering. With it I attempted to bridge the gap between sport science &amp; theory (and how other more mature sports make use of it to achieve top results and performances) and the climbing specific environment.

How to get *really strong* while staying injury free is the main focus of the book. 

If that sounds interesting to you, you can find more information about it on my website [trainHardButSmart.com](http://www.trainhardbutsmart.com). There is also a free PDF excerpt for you to check out and get an idea of the content, style and quality of the book.

If you have any questions feel free to send me an email or ask them right here, I'll check back regularly!

Have a great day &amp; climb harder!
Nic
TLDL: Training Beta Podcast 007 - Steve Bechtel Don't have time to listen? Still want the information? Read on as expert paraphraser and note-taking legend /u/Milyoo regales you with all the training tidbits fit to share from the Training Beta podcast series.

[007 Steve Bechtel](https://www.trainingbeta.com/media/tbp-007-steve-bechtel-training-power-endurance-running-weight-loss/)
http://climbstrong.com/ 

Steve is a recreational/retired climber.  He started in the mid 80's and was exposed to hard climbing from the jump, and so had a great opportunity to see the development of high-caliber climbers very early.  He owns a gym/training center with his wife in Lander (pop 10k) and they work with a diverse array of people in their 8000 sq/ft facility.  1/4 of this is a climbing gym whereas the rest is barbells, dumbells, boxes, pullup bars.  it is NOT a Crossfit "box".  He graduated with degree in exercise science - kind of a load of crap as it just tells you he knows the name of all the muscles.  In other words, he's learned more from training people over the last 20 years than he did in school.

**Climbing Analogs**: the golden rule is specificity, both motor specificity and metabolic.  so bouldering is motor specific to route climbing but is metabolically very different.  so when we look at other sports we're seeing wrestling, sprinting, gymnastics as metabolic analogs, but in terms of motor overlap it's very difficult.  so if something like Crossfit (vague general fitness) makes you better at climbing then you suck at climbing.  Climbing training should be 80% climbing/skill acquisition.  The rest should be adjunct strength/capacity building.  It's a skill sport.  

**Weight Training**: really useful tool, but needs to be limited to 20-25% of your training - tops.  He builds his programs around some big bang exercises (presses, deadlifts, squats).  *Interestingly, climbing is a concentric only sport.  contract - relax - contract.  as opposed to weight training with loaded eccentrics.  so they try to do concentric only exercises.  1) teaches motor patterns and 2) halves the volume of training.  less tired and less likely to put on mass.*  

**Practical Applications**: personal training isn't that personal.  push pull with upper body.  hinge at hip.  squat.  so we look at athletes and strengthen the movements.  

**example mid 13 climber** - tanking at the end of the day.  he tried to fix this by doing lower intensity reps.  what they found is he was more neurologically tired than physical.  they prescribed deadlift and overhead press on day 1 and squats and pullups - pretty heavy with lots of mobility training between sets.  4 sets/3 reps.  stronger and more work capacity.   they also added a non-skill oriented burnout set.  why?  *your body learns the last movements in a session better than the first.  you groove the most recent patterns.  so flailing at the end of the day is inscribing bad movement.*  something better would be hangboard, system laps, etc.  they do a set called rhythm intervals:  set of 4 holds in a square.  reach up alternating for 30.  rest on jugs 30 seconds.  4 minute set.  they can really wear you out without grooving bad patterns.  

**moving from 5.10-5.11 or 5.11-5.12**: if you cant climb 5.11 it's probably a matter of volume, but moving into 5.12 we see specific limitations - finger strength and/or upper body strength are typical culprits.  Generally speaking, don't look at success in terms of numbers, but instead really pay attention to the letters,  That is, build a strong base of difficulty rather than wasting a whole season trying to get to X numeric threshold.

**the Neely example**: her project is a 5.13c power route 21 moves.  no rest.  mostly crimps.  what should she do?  She needs to prepare so that the moves are reasonable.  Power endurance can be improved by 4x4, linked boulders, etc. but is your power and strength up to snuff?  she's 3 hanging.  *is she falling and pumped or falling because the moves feel hard*.  it's the latter so she's probably metabolically fine.  quick tip: count number of  moves and when you fall.  6 moves and a fall?  maybe try taking just before the place you usually fall and linking from there.  you don't want to  groove the fall.    

how long will it take for you to climb?  2.5 minutes?  train that.  no need to do 10 minute pumpy burns.  sprinter's mentality.   2 minute: 2 minute intervals.  5 sets.  take your Treadwall routine and increase intensity rather than extensivity and slowly make the route slightly harder.  slowly make the climbing harder, but maintain the metabolic pattern you need for success.  need to be specific.  that's the problem with training too many things at once:  the more qualities you try to pursue the harder it is neurologically to do any of them.  

**reader questions:**

**deadhanging for two months.  4 grips.  timer.  7":3".  weighs 220**:  pretty heavy for a climber.  his tendons are probably not any bigger than a 120lb female.  hangboard is about slow overload so no rush on the 'gains'.  like brushing your teeth.  not to save them for tomorrow, but to save them for the future.  keep after it.  it's a long term game.  

**running intervals?**  running for climbing is as important is climbing is for running.  nothing inherently wrong with running save for motor specificity.  *metabolics might be okay, but it's not upper body anaerobic.  anaerobic is specific to muscle groups.*  

**which phase to include weight loss into a program:**  when you're trying to perform well you need to put all your energy towards it.  base phase is probably the best time.  lots of volume which works well for weight loss.  nutrition is key.  you can't out train a crappy diet.  so you need to support your training and your weight loss; you need to be ready to be uncomfortable.  be really disciplined.  lose and defend your losses.  

**weight loss tips**:  beyond eating less.  Warrior 20 Diet - John Berrardi.  Lean meats, veggies, beans.  Avoid processed food and a lot of fruit. Intermittent fasting.  (OP note: if this interests you then you might look at Leangains) 

**what is too far for weight loss?**  really individual but inability to sleep and can't make it through a day is a good marker.  for women, something like loss of menstruation is a red flag.  women can probably do better by getting stronger.  

thanks!
Climbers with Desk Jobs - Do you do anything physical while you're working? How do you combat the negative effects of being stationary/sitting all day? Anything to help improve aspects of your climbing while you're stuck at a desk all day? I've been thinking about this a lot lately as I have to work at a desk for 8 hours a day 5 days a week and am curious if anyone does anything fitness/mobility wise while they're at work.


I generally try to:

* go on 3 walks a day, around 1 mile in distance for each walk
* Stretch and do some mobility drills, especially scapular retraction type stuff to combat the hunch (Molding Mobility is something I can do pretty easily at work)
* Drink lots of water (with a little salt to help absorption), and generally have at least 1 water bottle with Ultima (sugar free electrolyte powder drink mix) to keep my tissues hydrated and gliding properly.
* Use my hand grippers/expand your hand bands/IronMind egg/etc. throughout the day to counteract keyboard/mouse hand
* Sometimes try to mix in some push-ups, bw squats, and lunges during the day (if there were anywhere to do pull-ups or even rows I'd do those too)

I've been thinking about bringing some dumbbells or a kettlebell to work to mix in some other types of exercises, and definitely want to start working on my hip flexibility/mobility, but I'm not sure what other things would be beneficial or that I could even do.


It just feels like there's this huge amount of time while I'm at work that I can't be mobile or active, and I'd really like to come up with some ways to make this time a bit more productive from a movement/fitness perspective.


Thoughts?
Female climber looking to get stronger, climb harder I have been climbing a little longer than a year, but I'm still only hitting v3s and 4s. Trying 5s, but never getting past the crux. 

I climb with my boyfriend. We climb and train roughly the same, but he's progressing much more quickly than me.

I'm wondering if there are specific strength or training ideas for women trying to get stronger/better. Maybe techniques I should be working on that my boyfriend wouldn't think to focus on. He helps me out a lot and gives me great advice, but he's significantly taller and stronger than me so our betas are totally different. 

I'd love to learn some ways for a 5'3"-ish female (average weight, maybe slightly under) to get stronger. I can't just do infinite pull ups, but maybe I can get really good at heel hooks or something?
No Hang Finger Training - Some Notes Hey all.  I'm rounding the corner on about a dozen no hang finger sessions and i've gathered enough bodily feedback to warrant a sharing moment.  so let's huddle up:

i use [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/-Oo-diEX1Q/?taken-by=tbwilsonky) to train flexors.  pronated wrist - 25mm edge - half crimp - 10" - 85% Max.  i have quite a bit of time logged running a mono scheme, but I've switched to pairs recently for reasons i'll explain below.  

1. don't expect the sum of your mono/pair hangs to match your regular hang numbers.  if you can do 100 lbs on the 18mm (260 w/ bodyweight), then you shouldn't expect to do #35/finger.  my guess is the loss of inputs for innervation between muscles ([think irradiation; Tsatsouline](http://www.insane-athletics.com/blog/index.php/muscular-irradiation/)) results in a significant decrease in maximum loading.

1.  don't no hang monos.  our fingers do a pretty complicated support dance when we hangboard.  X finger sags a bit and Y picks up the load.  this continues until the system falls apart and we release as a result.  when you're loading a single digit, however, there is no support system.  you feel completely stable with the weight and then... you don't.  the structural integrity falls away so quickly that I started doing all my hangs with my off hand hovered over my wrist for a 'spot'.  the obvious fix for this is to simply lower weight to something manageable, but it's not hard to imagine that this prohibition falls apart quickly if we're feeling strong.  the fix?

1.  no hang in pairs.  front two and back two.  it gives you the support you miss when rolling mono and - for whatever reason - just feels 'right'.  in fact, i would go one step further and no hang all four fingers. 

i like these no hangs for people with shoulder impingement issues and for identifying (and correcting) weaker fingers, but i'm not keen on using them in lieu of standard hangs.  why?  they don't help us coordinate efforts between fingers.  there's more to functional finger strength than the cumulative efforts of each individual flexor - like everything else in climbing this is more of a networked capacity.  Think Hebb's postulate:

&gt; When an Axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased

This isn't a foreclosure on no hangs.  I think an argument could be made that we train flexors independently and then (re)integrate them back into the system through climbing itself.  The latter should account for the vast majority of our total work such that low volume no hangs shouldn't mess with our wiring too much.  

just some thoughts.  thanks for reading.
[meta] /r/climbharder potential growth I've noticed that /u/s_maisch has been participating in his AMA for nearly a week now, and has started commenting on other threads as well. I'm excited to see that he's stuck with us for a little while and hope that he continues to pop in when he has the time.

This got me thinking of a potential for r/climbharder that has been missing in the climbing training world for several years, which is an open forum where folks who are considered authorities on various training subjects can discuss training ideas, principles, methodology, or whatever with one another and the rest of us can learn by paying attention.

This used to exist in some form back in the heyday of the mountainproject training forums, or even further back in the days of rockclimbing.com or supertopo.com. But it seems in the past few years all the training authorities have retreated to their own personal websites, and while I completely understand the reasoning behind this, it would be nice to read and participate in conversations on training once in a while, rather than the one-sidedness of reading a blog or training website. 

In addition by having such knowledgeable people participating on this subreddit we can get good information and answers to specific questions much more quickly. One of the coolest things about the current rockprodigy forum for instance is that you can ask a question and have a pretty high probability of Mark Anderson answering the question. What better information than getting it straight from the horses mouth?

My point is, while I realize most people who run training blogs and websites are quite busy, and while several might see participation on this subreddit as a conflict of interests, I think there may be some potential for some of them to become active participants on climbharder, and the more people we have who know what they're talking about having intelligent discussions on training, the better for everyone.

I understand that u/milyoo has several other AMA's planned. Maybe we can convince the rest of these people to pop in every now and then once their AMA has concluded as well?
Can't lift my legs high enough I've recently discovered that I can't push up on both hands and then match a foot to one of my hands (see this helpful diagram https://imgur.com/8LjfMkI).

It's come up a few times, and stops me in my tracks every time. Can anybody tell me what I need to work on?

EDIT: Just realised I put the faces on the back of my guys heads. They're supposed to be facing the wall!
How to efficiently combine climbing and lifting? Hello there fellow climbers!
I want to combine my climbing training with weight lifting and a user on /r/fitness recommended me to ask you people, so here I am. So:

* I climb 2 times a week, always on Tuesdays and Thursdays, can't change that - section.
* I want to lift at least 2 times a week (one week day and one weekend day), 3 would be perfect, but I'm a little afraid of overtraining myself - what do you think?
* What body parts (besides legs) should I focus on, to get the most out of lifting (I'd also like to focus on my chest)? I guess this question doesn't apply to 3 days a week lifting, since I can do full body workout, so I need to find the best routine for eventual 2 days of lifting a week. 

Any advice would be extremely heplful
took a personal coaching session at the Cafe Kraft today need to write this down so i dont forget the important parts, but i figured you might benefit from this too, so im posting this.


2 hours.

talked about goals: -&gt; flashcomb-focussed training until late January for the Hardmoves regional battle, then focussing on strength and fingerstrength for July - September season in Silvretta

personal weaknesses:

mobility ok. for specific stretching i should talk with one of my university lecturers bc he wrote a thesis on it. only real disbalance is in my upper cervical spine where im not that mobile (1st i thought thats my pectoral muscles, then i thought i have a very short lat, turns out its none of them (maybe lat a little)). 
got an exercises with a blackroll for it with hands over the head fixed on a barbell or anything fixated.
2 exercises for latstreching (including triceps) using elasticbands

got a new mobility/stretching/warmupexercise i really like, gotta try it out (kinda yogalike).

now to climbing:

had to do some problems i all flashed then tryed out an exercise to do one of them a couple times with little rest mimicing a comb where i cant flash one of the problems and have to try again and figure out the most efficient way to do it. (even tho i flashed the prob i couldnt do it a 2nd time (3 times foot slipped/not rested/not focussed enough), need to work on motivation to do already finished problems again with mental focus!!!

 time was almost over so we went to the campusboard where he figured out a great weakness of mine:
cant campus straight up (i should do a 1-4-7 which i cant, then do 1-3-6) and i am not bending the upper arm enough at the 2nd move (past 90°) so he gave me another exercise to fix that.

90° blocking for 5s on the big edge of the BM2k with semiclosed crimp (bc i should drop my hangboardworkouts until my fingers are healthy enough, so i have to crimp, but on a very big edge and the exercise combines both) then doing 5-12 very fast pullups only going down to 90° and straight up, preferably 12 so i should use an elasticband i step on to reduce weight (volume is the important part for now!).

then we talked a bit about anatomy. i recently learned about the muscles that connect to each fingerpads (wich basicly means that open-hand and half-crimp(/closed) use completly different muscles in the forearms (m. flexor digitorum superficialis (connecting to pad 2 so crimps) vs m. flexor digitorum profundus (connecting to pad 1 so open hand).

so its basicly bullshit to train open-hand all the time, you need to train crimps too, if not a little more then open hand! yes open hand is bad for your joints and yes crimps is bad for your pulleys, but it needs to be trained!

then coming up earlier was trainingsschedule:

to my 16h doing sports in the university week i should split my 3 (i dont think my body can handle more) sessions a week up like this:

- 1 day bouldering in flashmode (in my home gym or in the Boulderwelt in Munich if i run out of problems in my home gym)
- 1 day on the moonboard finishing ATLEAST 12 problems!
- 1 days on the hangboard (exercise from above) with additional exercises
- 1 day projecting outdoors (he told me to do this as little as possible because climbing outdoors it like something completely different then training in current (winter-)conditions...)
- 1 day training with a friend repeating already done problems and perfecting the climbing using different strategies

Strategies: 

- climbing a problem 3 times with max 3 minutes break, bringing it down to as little as possible so you focus on perfecting the movement to save energy

- climbing a problem in as little time as possible (stop the time with a partner) not to focus on doing the MOVES faster, but to do the CHANGING OF POSITIONS between moves faster (explanation: where does Ondras speed in climbing comes from? no his speed is not while he is moving between holds, but when he has both hands on holds he changes bodypositions really really fast to bring the time he has to hang on holds down. he told me sometimes changing bodypositions only takes Ondra about 0,2 seconds which is fucking impressive!)


well that is everything i remember right now, will edit if i remember something new.

btw.: should i ask them (Patrick Matros and Dickie Korb) if they would like to do an ama here in /r/climbharder?
Good (non-climbing) gym exercises to improve/maintain while you can't get on the wall Headed on Christmas vacation for a couple weeks and won't have regular access to a climbing gym, but I will have access to a smaller, apartment/hotel style gym. Any recommendations for exercises to help me try and stay in climbing shape?


Thinking of core exercises, plyometrics, circuit training and the like.
11a to 12c and what I've learned in the process... Hello redditors,
Over the last year I’ve been steadily improving and made a consistent jump in redpoint level from 11a to 12c in the climbing gym and I wanted share what I’ve learned through this process.  Also at the moment I’m taking a small break from climbing and doing Christmassy stuff so I might be bored as hell and would like to write a bit about the sport.  The article turned out to be quite long and I just hope that it may be useful to some or at least provide some good procrastination to others. Either way – happy holidays and good sending vibes for 2016! :p

Let me first just mention that  this **does not make me an authority in any way**, in fact, there are probably thousands and thousands of people who casually onsight 12c and above and they are probably far better at writing an article such as this one, however I’ll just share what **worked for me.** For a pro view of training I seriously recommend, Dave Macleod's 9 ot 10 climbers make the same mistakes or Neil Gresham's DVD Climbing Masterclasses. Seriously good, and both made a HUGE impact on my training.

Before I start also let me just say that a big goal throughout the process of training was to **rest sufficiently and not ovetrain**. If you overtrain you could mess up your fingers, elbows or shoulders, take ages off and ruin your training aspirations. It seriously sucks.  Simple  rule to remember:

**When you train you cause microdamage to your tissues. After training, when you’re chilling and having a rest day, your tissues and muscles recover and become stronger. ** If you train all the time, your just causing more and more damage which will eventually lead to injury. So rest sufficiently to become stronger and to avoid injury. It’s also super fun just to relax a few times a week from that hard work going up walls  Resting is sometimes better than  climbing! Heh

So here are the factors which helped me:

 - **Being able to boulder out the moves** – I think an indispensible part of the process was that I had a decent bouldering level beforehand.  In the past year I’d done quite a few boulder problems in the V6/V7 range and onsighted V5.  As I concentrated more into route climbing for a year that bouldering power decreased steadily with about a grade but was definitely enough for mid range 5.12s. 
If you are aspiring to make a jump say from 11b to 11d/12a, but are struggling with most V4s on the bouldering matt, then bouldering is what I’d concentrate on for some time. Bouldering power is hard to gain, and it might feel that you’re not making any progress for months’ on end, however all the struggles and the days of failure are important part of developing strength and technique. **Learn to love these days of struggle!**
However if you already feel strong for your grade see below.

 - **Fear of falling**.  The single biggest limitation to probably around 90% of the climbers I see in the gym and outside (this is of course a totally scientifically estimated number) in the climbing areas where I go to. Here are some extensive notes which helped me make some gains in this area of climbing:

It takes time. Like a lot of time to retrain your brain that it's safe to fall. At least a few months for consistent gains. You need to be testing out falling every single time you climb during this time, taking a minimum of 3 to 5 lead falls, every single time. After I complete my normal climbing, I generally jump something way out of my league, somewhere a grade or two above my redpoint limit and this causes me to fall constantly. It's both strength/power endurance training and fall practice combinbed.

Allow temporary defeats. I've taken some massive lobs outdoors but occasionally I still fail to commit for some clips indoors if I get the position wrong. It's a weakness, but everyone has a weakness from time to time, be kind to yourself. What matters is that you are improving over a long term - say a definitely improvement over the last 5 months. Developing a good head is not a quick fix at all.

Constantly expand your zone of comfort. For me it was a revelation initially being able to committ to hard moves and falling when the quickdraw was at chest level, then at knee level, then at the feet, then with the next quickdraw around close to your chest/waist. My next weakness that needs working is falling when pulling up slack for the clip, which I'll be working on next year. 

**Don't shout "Take!" and give up on the route. Most people shout out take and fall off because they simply let go. Shout "Watch me!"**. Now you have your full belayer's attention and you are ready to go for that extra move and maybe take an unexpected lob. It will be fine, your belayer's watching you after all! 

Don't underestimate the effect of height. Your brain will feel differently when you fall from the 4th clip compared to when you fall going for the belay at 50 feet. I only realised it was a significant weakness of mine when the local wall set a problem which finished with a dyno to to the last hold. Take a fall from the last part of quite high routes and you'll make quite large gains really. 

You need to understand that it's pretty much inevitable to make progress if you practice falling every single time you climb. Just keep at it!  Remember, trying a 12a and falling off and doing a bit of bouldering on a rope is excellent fall practice. Probably more valuable than going up 6 clips on a 5.9, looking down at your knot, looking down at your belayer twice, shouting "Are you ready?", belayer shouting "Yes, jump off", "Okay, I'm jumping!", looking down again and then finally falling off.  Additionally picking a route with a some single dynamic hard moves close to the clip will serve your head very well to get used to the sensation of falling. 

Have fun at it! It’s a pretty special feeling, flying through the air, after you’ve tried your best on a hard project. I weirdly find myself enjoying as much as sending, if not more…! 

 - **Fear of failure**: To some people this is just as strong as fear of falling. Typical thinking is: “I won’t try this route because it’s a corner and I’m not strong at corners”. Or “This 11c looks hard, I’ve already ticket 12a so I should cruise this, however I think I’ll struggle at this so I won’t even try it.” This mentality is detrimental to climbing improvement and will only produce large technique gaps. Learning to love what you are weak is what it’s at and going for it! Yes sometimes you will take that fall on a strange 10c outdoors when you should be cruising but who cares? Climbing is fun, right? And you just learned a valuable lesson! For me it generally worked to try 1 thing I was uncomfortable with every single session – examples include a hard looking onsight of a midgrade route, trying a wall or angle I’m crap at (slabs for me) etc..

 - **Technique and pacing.**
If you can generally boulder out the individual moves, and are not afraid of taking a good fall, you’re in a good place to be, however, you may still be falling in only a few clips in. This is a common problem for boulderers progressing into leading.  As you do more and harder lead climbing the technique and pacing must change drastically. Learning how to hold certain holds with the least amount of force and not overgripping requires mileage of easier ground and conscientious effort initially on harder routes. You must strive to be physically at your most relaxed and mentally at your most aggressive for the vast majority of the route. 
**Resting on the route**: All my successful redpoints have had one thing in common – I’ve spent the most time shaking out and my recovery rate has been sufficient to allow me to the moves to the next rest.  Every little shake helps – no matter whether it’s a microshake between small crimps through the crux or a 30 second chilling out time on a jug psyching yourself for the crux. Rest on route and practice resting, as much as possible. It really is a deal breaker if you don’t do this on harder routes.
**Pacing**: The general rule is to go quickly on steep sustained ground, however utilizing every available rest higher up. Never be rushed however, footwork needs to be precise, every single time. Go at a high speed only if doesn’t really sacrifice the accuracy of your foot placements. If you feel yourself getting pumped, have a small break in a good position and focus on your breathing and shaking out.

 - **Endurance**:
Now that you feel you’re working well on your pacing, your technique is spot on, you’re not overgripping because you’re afraid of falling, but you still find yourself slipping off the easy V3 move near the top. That was exactly my problem on my recent 12c project. 
What worked for me:

Endurance training! If you have not done endurance training before it will make incredibly solid gains in your climbing probably within weeks. Endurance is split into two components.

Aerobic endurance: This is generally developed by climbing at a slight manageable pump for small periods of time. For me this was doing stints of 10a up to 10 c on the wall for up to 25 minutes of time. This is a boring part of training, few people enjoy dropping many grades and doing this for the majority of their session, however aerobic endurance will greatly improve your recovery – both on and off the route and for me, it was really important to force myself to do it.  After a few weeks of this training I returned to my project and I was shocked at my recovery rates at holds that I was not expecting to be recovering at!  Hugely important tool, no one should really overlook it. 

Anaerobic endurance: Hugely important as well – mostly for stints of continuous hard climbing without much rest (on most routes it’s within 15 moves…maybe 30 in some extremes, but I’ve never really encountered a route with more than 15 moves without a decent rest in between, however I haven’t really climbed all that much.)

Training this endurance will result in huge gains in both technique and your ability to go through continuous sections of hard climbing. What worked for me in training it:

Top roping hard climbs up to 3 times in a row: These needed to be within the 11d, 12b bracket.  My goal wasn’t to climb these without falling necessarily, but just to develop the maximum amount of pump, while focusing on maintaining my footwork. Both are incredibly important  physical and mental aspects of climbing. If I fell, I’d just get straight back on the wall, and carry on climbing. I’d often go to the top having fallen 5-7 times, however with a burning pump in my arms and a head that’s learned how to place my feet accurately when my arms are burning.  It’s vital to give yourself a good amount of rest after this – 2 days is what I’d usually take after training like this to avoid injury. Remember – you get strong only when you’re resting after a session, not actually when training. 

 - Final crucial aspect and probably the most important one overall: **Trying damn hard**.

When I observe people climb I often notice that a lot of time, people fall because they give up and let go. Don’t let go, never on an onsight attempt or a serious redpoint attempt. I guess we all do that from time to time but limiting the amount of time you fall off because you conscientiously let go is a crucial step in climbing. If you never fall off “naturally” because your hands uncurl, you’ll never reach your cutting edge in climbing I suppose. This is a bit I need to work on a lot more… I think for the past year, I’ve only really really went for it and tried hard maybe 20 times, each time either ticking or coming close to ticking projects or onsights.

Trying hard for me is not just about power screaming and doing moves (although this happens as well). Trying hard means getting well out of your comfort zone, climbing uncomfortably above the clip, taking whippers and not succeeding for the vast majority of the times you’re actually climbing. It also means sticking to your training to an extent no matter what’s happening in your life, missing parties from time to time to have a training session. It also means eating healthy food and getting enough sleep (I’m terrible at that one…) to maximize your recovery. 

Thanks for reading this overly long article…I guess I’m really quite bored over the Christmas holidays without climbing.
"There is no too short, too tall, too heavy, too warm, too wet, or too humid. There is just one excuse: too weak." -Alex Megos ([from this interview](https://www.8a.nu/?IncPage=https%3A//www.8a.nu/articles/ShowArticle.aspx%3FArticleId%3D8934))

Lately I've just been sick of hearing excuses at the gym and thought this was a really good attitude to have. I thought maybe the quote would inspire you guys too.
I shamelessly stole the PowerCompany campus workouts. I've copied them into a nice, printable spreadsheet that I use at the gym. [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vaR4TJYo0pq-feKftclL2sDBfcLpPLooSURqdXBlOpI/edit?usp=sharing) is the spreadsheet, if anyone is interested.  Also, comments and such are welcome.

[Discuss] What to Train — Analyzing the strengths and weaknesses in your climbing I'd like to kick off discussion around an /r/climbharder "checklist" — a guide to assessing the strengths and weaknesses in your climbing and using that to guide training.

The basic question is simply:

&gt; **How do you assess your strengths and weaknesses, and how does that factor into your training?**

---

**Meta**

I put off writing this for a few days because it became rather... complicated.

Apologies for the length of this post — I think there's some valuable stuff in here, even though it ultimately needs to be edited. That's where feedback/discussion comes in!

---

**Knowledge Dump**

To kick things off, I'd like to knowledge dump some of the things I care about when assessing myself. 

- Start with the question, "Why did I fail?"
    - Optimal training is *specific*
    - Specific weaknesses are also easier to train
- Physical
    - Fingers
        - What is my maximum strength (MxS)? (10" max-weight hang on a 1/2-1 pad edge)
        - What is my strength-endurance (SE)? (7" repeaters, ~49" set duration)
        - Is SE:MxS at least 75%?
        - Is any grip particularly weak?
        - Is any finger particularly weak?
        - Can I comfortably make a fist?
        - Does anything hurt?
    - Wrists:
        - Does my wrist want to "pop" on wide slopers?
        - Any pain mantling?
    - Shoulders:
        - Do I have large, pain-free ROM?
        - Can I press overhead?
        - Any pain on gastons?
        - Pain transitioning from undercling to overhead?
    - Back:
        - How's my pull up strength? Pull up endurance?
        - How's my deadlift?
        - How's my barbell row?
        - Has my roof climbing kept pace with my lifts?
    - Biceps/Triceps:
        - Am I struggling holding underclings on steep terrain?
        - Do I struggle to maintain fixed elbow angle? [1]
    - Core [2]:
        - How's my front lever?
        - How're my core intervals?
        - Can I move legs independently of each other and my body?
        - Can I control swings?
        - Can I hold toe hooks?
        - Can I hold low feet, especially under a roof?
    - Hips:
        - How's my deadlift?
        - How's my pigeon pose?
        - Do high steps push me off the wall?
        - Are high heel-hooks/matches uncomfortable?
    - Misc:
        - Is my non-dominant side weaker? (It often is...)
- Technique/Style
    - What styles do I like or dislike? Why? [3] Consider:
        - Style: Static; tension; dynamic; compression
        - Holds: Pinches; crimpers; edges; textured vs. non-textured
        - Feet: Volumes; slopers; tiny edges; smooth holds
        - Terrain: Roof; prow; slab; vertical; arete; bulge; dihedral
    - What moves do I like or dislike? Why? Consider:
        - Flexibility: Hand-foot match; high step
        - Strength/Balance: Lock off; cross over/under; mantles
        - Tension/Balance: Drop knee; back step; flag/reverse flag
        - Footwork: Heel hooks; toe hooks; high steps; smears; drop knee; back step
        - Coordination: Deadpoints; dynos; barn door; drive-by; pogo; campusflag/reverse flag
    - What holds make me cringe? Consider:
        - Tiny crimpers
        - Wide — or thin — pinches
        - Fat slopers
        - "Nothing-there" feet
- Strategy:
    - Did I warm up enough?
    - Is my time better spent resting today?
    - Did I misread a sequence?
    - Could I have recovered from a misread? Did I have a "Plan B"?
    - Did I rest enough between attempts?
    - Did I rest *too much* between attempts? (E.g. for SE training)
- Mentality:
    - Am I afraid of falling? Is that fear legitimate?
    - Am I afraid of failing, especially in public?
    - Am I trying my hard enough?
    - Am I making excuses?
    - Am I avoiding giving a real send-go?

[1] I've found this to be a good question for just about anything strength-related. Climbing is all about transitioning between body positions, which implies certain joint angles and configurations. Think about what joints are involved, what muscles hold them in place, and go from there.

[1] "Core" strength is fundamentally about your ability to resist rotation (read: gravity/momentum) and maintain fixed body position on the wall. A very good test of core strength is maneuvering out of a roof with low feet and no heel hooks options.

Similarly, any position that forces you to move your legs independently of your body *without moving your COG* is a good test.

[3] This is another good guiding principle. You're probably good at the styles you *like* — that's a self-reinforcing feedback loop. But you stand to improve faster by focusing on styles you dislike, especially ones that disproportionally favor strength (like steep climbing) or technique (like slab climbing).

Styles and problems in the middle are, in my experience, much less useful for training. You can train strength, and you can train technique, but you can't effectively train both simultaneously (there is plenty of literature on this, and my experience bears it out).
Video analysis in this sub? I know a lot of coaches accept videos for analysis, and use these videos to try and pinpoint weaknesses in climbers they can't physically observe. It can be pretty hard to figure out exactly what we need to work on (like someone said in the "what to train" thread, people tend to pick weaknesses that still fall under their more general style)

Obviously talking to friends/other climbers at the gym/crag is super helpful, but is there any interest in submitting our own videos for critique on here? Analysis from anonymous redditors might be pretty helpful. I think they generally ask for several angles on warm-up, red-point, and project problems (or something like that). Anyone want to submit videos/analyze? Think this could be useful?
Inside Flag, a dying technique or just underutilized??? Morning Climbharder!  So I have been slowly watching Greshams Masterclass videos, I never really watched them all the way through and thought I might be able to pick something up or just use them as a way to re-frame my thoughts on technique or just pick up on some different coaching cues to use.

Anyhow, just watched the video on flagging and Neil makes the comment that when you mistakenly get set-up on your inside edge instead of your outside edge to effectively twistlock/drop knee, that in lieu of switching feet to set-up the drop knee; that an inside flag would be a more efficient technique to use especially when feet are particularly low.

Just curious on thoughts about the inside flag technique, as I rarely employ it myself (partly because I don't really have it preprogrammed in my technical repertoire) and typically switch feet for the drop knee and rarely do I see other climbers utilizing this technique.

Do you think it is indeed more efficient than simply switching feet?  I would think that it depends on your footwork and size of the footholds (hopswitch or matching feet), but see his point that for a moment, particularly when hopswitching, that your arms are taking on more weight.  

Also, when watching the video, it appears as though it takes more time to employ an inside flag rather than an outside flag.  I wonder if this increased time to perform the inside flag effectively makes it similar to switching feet and using a drop knee?

Are there any situations/sequences you can think of where an inside flag would definitely be most efficient technique?

Thanks!

/climbharder Master Sticky Hey.   I'm going to compile a sticky post with all of our most useful discussions.

[Humor] The Code of the Sith I was having a conversation with a friend and he mentioned that when it comes to training he's a Sith, which reminded me of this (I'm a nerd and KOTOR was probably the best game ever). I feel like it's pretty fucking applicable to training, except for that bit about the force.

*The Sith Code:*

*Peace is a lie, there is only passion.*

*Through passion, I gain strength.*

*Through strength, I gain power.*

*Through power, I gain victory.*

*Through victory, my chains are broken.*

*The Force shall free me.*
Tips for tasty veggies and protein Some folks were interested in tips for cooking over in the diet thread so I thought I'd start a topic for people to share their cooking tips. A big part of eating healthy is avoiding processed foods so being able to cook makes a big difference.

My learning has been from working in two kitchens, one of which was at a fairly nice restaurant. The rest has been from reading and the internet. I'm not an amazing chef by any stretch but my food is good enough that people seem excited when they come over for dinner.

My expertise are limited to my diet which is mostly meat and veggies. I have beans on occasion but they tend to not agree with me. Maybe some vegetarians or others can chime in with some tips. I also rarely cook wheat based foods because they don't agree with my wife (bloating, digestive distress, heart burn, etc.). I can give suggestions on flour alternatives if anyone is interested but that's another topic altogether.

I think I can keep responding to this post so I'll put categories below and fill them in as I find time. There's lots to talk about.
Tale of the tape survey I was wondering how many people would be interested in seeing a tale of the tape type survey for climbing.

I think that with enough participants it could be very interesting to see how things like BMI, forearm circumference, height or ape index were correlated with climbing grades.

If you're interested let me know what type of things you would want to see included and I'll see about putting together a Google survey or something like that.
I can climb 5.10b~c no problem, but having a hard time climbing 5.10a with continuous negative slope. How do you train for that? I can climb most 5.10b or c no problem. I can even climb an overhang (if it's short enough)       
But I can't go above 3 quickdraws on a route with continuous negative slope       
     
My arms aren't pumped after, but my arms are really tired during the climb     
         
      
      
The annoying part is that I have to start from the beginning when I fall       
     
What muscle do I need to train to climb continuous negative slope (and big overhang)?       
Also what kind of foot technique should I work on that will help me?
Let's Discuss Hangboarding I wanted to have a discussion about hangboarding where we break down what's really going on, what we're really trying to achieve by doing it, and whether the protocols we use are ideal, or if they can be improved upon.

The way I see it, the type of hangboarding you do should be dependent, first and foremost on your goals, and what is ideal for one goal won't necessarily be ideal for another. For instance, I've found that Max Hangs -&gt; Min Edge is ideal for hard outdoor bouldering, but for competition prep where you need to send 4-5 hard boulders within a 3-4 hour period, the MASSIVELY increased TUT from repeaters is actually superior.

On the other hand, if you know you have nothing specific coming up that you want to train for, and just want to get stronger, I'm actually beginning to wonder whether we shouldn't start looking at doing max hangs with even more weight and far lower hang times (a problem solved by doing 1-arm-hangs for 5 seconds). Basically, increase the intensity to the highest possible degree every session and shoot for PR's until we plateau.

So here's my breakdown of the different types of hangboarding:

**Max Hangs** - 10s hangs with a weight that can be held for a maximum of 13s. Usually done on a 1-pad edge (~16mm - 22mm depending on finger size) Typically done in a half-crimped or open handed position. Rest time is usually 3-4 minutes per set. 3-5 sets are typically performed per grip, emphasis is usually on 2-3 key grips. 

* Finger Strength (Very High)

* Tendon Durability Improvement (High)

* Neurological Improvement (High)

* Finger Endurance (Low)

* Injury Risk (Low)

* Time Commitment (Low)

**Min Edge** - 8s hangs done on the smallest edge that can be held for a maximum of 10s (with added weight if the edge can't be downsized any more). Typically done in a half-crimped or full crimped position. Rest time is usually 3-4 minutes per set. 3-5 sets are typically performed per grip, emphasis is usually on 2-3 key grips.

* Finger Strength (High)

* Tendon Durability Improvement (Very High)

* Neurological Improvement (Very High)

* Finger Endurance (Low)

* Injury Risk (High)

* Time Commitment (Low)

**Repeaters** - Typically 7s hangs with 3s rest counting as a single rep, with 5-7 reps done in succession to complete a set. 1-3 sets performed, with 3-4 minute rest per set, often on many different grip types (4-7). Edge size is variable. Grips are generally more diverse and include things like monos, 2 finger combos, etc.

* Finger Strength (Moderate)

* Tendon Durability Improvement (Moderate)

* Neurological Improvement (Moderate)

* Finger Endurance (Very High)

* Injury Risk (Moderate)

* Time Commitment (High)

**One arm hangs** - Typically 5-10s hangs with one arm hanging, and the other arm used for assistance if necessary. Edge size is variable. 3-6 sets per arm, per grip, with 3-4 minutes rest between sets. Can be done with a pulley setup to remove a fixed amount of weight, or can be done with static support such as a sling to remove a variable amount of weight so the user can keep the intensity as high as possible at all times. Can be done deadhanging (which makes rotation a problem) or locked off (which minimizes the rotational problem). Typically done in a half crimped, full crimped, or open handed position.

* Finger Strength (Very High)

* Tendon Durability Improvement (Very High)

* Neurological Improvement (High)

* Finger Endurance (Very Low)

* Injury Risk (Very High)

* Time Commitment (Low)
Nutrition I have read very little on proper nutrition and diet, if you don't mind sharing your thoughts, please comment/advise.

In relations to recovery, specifically after an intense workout, 

How much do you eat?

Do you eat more than usual, less than usual, or maintain your diet? 

Is there a recommended protein:carb:fat ratio?

Does this go into the next day as well? 

How many hours after a workout will your body continue to require additional nutrition to properly recover?

Does the nutrition required from a power workout differ from a strength workout?
Rock climbing poster Hi all!  Any thoughts on the coolest rock climbing poster you've seen?  Looking to hang one in my office.   I have a whole wall, so size doesn't matter.  Thank you!
What do you wish you knew when you started? Inspire by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4pl3yc/things_i_wish_i_knew_8_years_ago/) post, what do you wish you knew when you were first starting out?

[Hype] Eva Lopez AMA Incoming Just working on a date, but expect to see an AMA here sooner than later.  So ready those /CH thinking caps, tape up your fingers, and let's get ready to.... watch her answer roughly the same question over and over again!

It's all happening!  Again!
Tale of the tape survey - Results It's been a while since I put up the survey and I've been a bit slack with actually doing any analysis on this so apologies for that. Here's a brief look at the results of the survey.

There was a lot of variation between people at every grade so I grouped the variables and took an average at each range. Also to make it easier for analysis I converted everybody's route climbing grade into Australian grades using the 8a.nu conversion chart.

Unsurprisingly there was a relationship between climbing ability and [weight](http://imgur.com/VEDChlo), and between [BMI](http://imgur.com/c7LHYV2) and climbing ability. The more interesting thing there was that the fall off in ability with BMI was only really seen above BMI's of 21. Climbing ability increased with BMI up to about 20 and peaked around 21-22. Also with weight, the drop in climbing ability was only seen with people over 75kg. There didn't seem to be any relationship with height.

Also unsurprising was the link between climbing [frequency](http://imgur.com/pUApR3R), length of [time](http://imgur.com/saJP9Dr) climbing and climbing ability. Basically if you climb more often, and have been climbing for longer, you are more likely to be a better climber.

There was maybe something there for Ape [Index](http://imgur.com/RNnPy3K), once you take away the extreme ends of the scale (some of which could have been caused by confusion between inches and cm.... some people seemed to fill in a mixture of both).

If anyone loves stats and wants to do a bit more analysis on the data let me know and I'll sort out getting it to you, so long as you agree to post any findings on here.

Hopefully you find this interesting, feel free to ask me questions and I'll do my best to use the data to answer.
Tips for short (I mean super-short) climbers? I'm 4'11" and love climbing and am part of a club at my college for it. Every time I go in to practice bouldering routes, I'm the last one to pick up on them. Many of the moves are much harder for shorter climbers, or at least, that's what all the other members say. Any other shorter climbers have advice on how to make it easier (I just don't want to be last, really)?
joe Kinder's Training Program So, while on Instagram I saw a story by Kinder. In it he's panning around his training shed, and then pans to his papers listing his training plan. Praise be to Apple for the iPhone camera quality, I downloaded the  video and transcribed the papers so I could see what exactly Kinders training looked like (for research, obviously most people can't train like a pro). This is what I found. I did also format it into a word document but I don't feel like posting that somewhere, so here is a pastebin of the raw text. Discuss!

Climbing specific core workout? Do any of you have an awesome core workout tailored for climbing to maximize send ability?
Why are you working your abs so much ? In a recent discussion about climbing specific core workout ( https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/4y8dq0/climbing_specific_core_workout/ ) I got really surprised by the number of answers that suggested mostly "frontal" core exercises.


What I mean here is that most of the exercises seemed to target the abs and sometimes the lower back : front lever, deadlift, dragon flies, leg raises, etc...


So I figured I'd just ask about some moves that I struggle (or see people struggle with) that require core (as far as I can tell) and that to me aren't covered with abs exercises, and hopefully we can discuss that and see if doing other exercises (which I'll cover later) is beneficial or not after all.


Side Squeeze Hand Match :
https://www.mountainproject.com/images/62/22/106726222_large_50cbcf.jpg
In this position, trying to match the right hand to the left one. This move often has me moving in all directions at the same time and it's nearly impossible if it needs to be precise, like matching in a pocket or something like that...


Far hand-feet opposition :
http://www.verticallifemag.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pendragon.png
Being like this and having to release the right hand with even the slightest bit of control.


"You don't need to bend your arms"
http://allirainey.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/A3.jpg
That thing we say to first-time climbers, not realizing it requires a lot of anti-rotation core to actually be able to pull it off...


Side Press up
http://cdn.ukc2.com/i/231534.jpg
Trying, from this position to go up the grey volume by pressing onto it with the feet in opposition against the wall.


So there are a few moves that I often struggle with or see people struggling with. To me thy all involve the core, to a certain degree (he last one is a lot of triceps also, for sure) but they don't seem to be so ab intensive, and either mostly with obliques, or anti-rotational.


First of all, am I right so far ?


Second of all... Do I just notice people falling more on those because they're difficult to me ? If so, in what kind of moves do you see people fail because they lack abs ? Except for being unable to put your feet back up in a roof or the occasional compression between a double heel hook and a sloper... I can't tell.


And now comes the last part about alternative core exercises for the obliques and anti-rotational core muscles... Right now I'm doing Side Dumbell Lifts (http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/dumbbell-side-bend) and Wood Chops (https://youtu.be/pAplQXk3dkU) and I'm liking those... I've tried russian twist but felt like I needed too much weight to make it a strength exercise and it felt uncomfortable... I've done Windshield Wipers on the floor and on  the bar. I like those but they seem difficult to scale, above 2kg per ankle, which would be impressive though.


So... that's a lot of thoughts and questions, I hope they'll inspire some of you to share your thoughts too, anecdotes, data and experiment, I'm surprised to not see those kind of exercises more often done in the gyms and discussed in the sub !
Weekly r/climbharder hangout A little early this week as I'm going camping tomorrow.

Still not making it out climbing frequently enough (2 days per week). Need to get that hangboard. Did some campus work on Sunday and fingers felt achey. A regular bouldering session yesterday and while I was able to make progress on some projects and felt stronger, my right middle finger is quite sore today. Nothing acute but definitely not right. Flexor tendon maybe. A few days rest while camping will do it some good.

Some great discussions this week. Really enjoyed the core muscle threads. It got me thinking about shoulder muscle supplementary exercises. A lot of the moves I struggle with have the hands wide and either squeezing compression or iron cross type movements. Transitioning into and out of these positions is even harder. I feel like there may be some body weight work to be done on gymnastic rings. Archers, wide ring push ups, iron cross progressions, etc. Maybe the front lever actually as a place there.

What's new climbharder?
[Survey] I want your training logs We've got a lot of dedicated climbers here, and I think we're sitting on a ton of training information.  So lets try to use it for something.

Here's the idea.  I want to see what percent change is possible in a hangboarding cycle for a couple different hang types.  I'm collecting some general background information, and the starting and ending weight of each training cycle.  If you have multiple training cycles available, please submit multiple times. Then I'm hoping to tease out some trends and stuff.  If you have multiple training cycles available, please post them.  If you have logs in the form of spreadsheets, I will log them for you if you send them to me at slainthorny@gmail.com


The raw data will be posted and available, and I'll post anything interesting I find.  If you have questions or whatever post them here.
[Here is the form](https://goo.gl/forms/h1IWC7s60w2Mc3k83)

Thanks!
What single thing has accelerated your climbing the most? Could be a type of excercise, sort of technique, mindset... anything. I want to know!
Best routine to begin hang boarding? I have been climbing about 1.5 years and would like to implement hang boarding into my training routine. Which routine would be the safest and best to begin with? Repeaters? Max hangs? Both? I'm guessing that weighted hangs are not going to be a good idea until my fingers become used to the stress. I would like to work on power-endurance because I mainly boulder. If anyone has an opinion I'd love to hear it, thanks!
GRIPPUL: Strength-To-Weight ratio for Climbing ##UPDATED Sep 17, 2016 13:50am MST: 

Chart updated with more climbers. To add yourself, post your weight, and max one arm pull or hang below.

2 weeks ago we had another Grippul Challenge among some of the strongest climbers in the Colorado at the Spot Bouldering gym. And we got the same results from our previous test done at previous Grippul Challenges. This time we had a weight scale to score competitors accurately by ranking them according to their strength-to-weight ratio.

##What does this mean?
This means that we took their weight first, and then had them go up the cycles of weight, lifting the weight from below with a 15 degree crimp on the Grippul bolted at the lowest position on the Grippul.

##Strength-to-Weight Formula
Finger Strength (lb) / Body Weight (lb). = STW (Strength-to-Weight ratio)

##What grade can they climb?
As we previously found in past Grippul Challenges, Most climbers who are bouldering double digits between V10-V14 were able to pull 100%-130% of their body weight on the 15 degree crimp. Again, they were lifting the Grippūl from below, which was attached to kettle bells.

We also found a correlation of Grades, by climbers telling us what they climb.

##For a climber who pulls: 
Climbers tested* | Climber Finger STW** | Single Climber Metric | Grade They Climb |
--------|-----------|----------|-------|
2|50% of Body weight (.5) | Weighs: 130 lb Pulled: 65 lb | V4-v5 |  
4|60% of Body weight (.6) | Weighs: 130 lb Pulled: 78 lb | V6-v7 |  
5|70% of Body weight (.7) | Weighs: 120 lb Pulled: 84 lb | V7-V7+ |
4|80% of Body weight (.8) | Weighs: 150 lb Pulled: 120 lb | v7-V8+ |
3|90% of Body weight (.9) | Weighs: 143 lb Pulled: 128 lb | v9-v10 |
2|100% of Body weight (1) | Weighs: 150 lb Pulled: 150 lb | V10-v13 |
3|110% of Body weight (1.1) | Weighs: 162 lb Pulled: 178 lb | v11-v13 |
4|120% of Body weight (1.2) | Weighs: 131 lb Pulled: 157 lb | V12-v13 |
2|130% of Body weight (1.3) | Weighs: 170 lb Pulled: 221 lb | v13-15 |

*^(We combined two events where we actually have weights and grades for climbers. Our latest event at the Spot Bouldering Gym we had a scale, and only 18 climbers tested.)

**^(Only showing climbers who's strength-to-weight is 50-130%)

**Disclaimer:** Of course these numbers are based on observation, and what climbers told us that they climbed. This can only be used as a guide rather then as a solid claim of grade to STW. This also doesn't account for the climbers overall body strength. 

&gt; We had one fairly "new" climber who pulled 120% of his body weight, only because his industry/work outside of climbing required him to have strong hands. At the time he didn't know what his finger strength was, and was working V4's and V5's. After we tested him, we introduced him to a coach to help him with movement, and technique, and now he is sending 8's, and speeding through the grades as he learns more movement and technique.

##Closing Thoughts
**So what does all this even mean to pull 130% of your body weight?** Based on what we saw from the event, a climber who weighs 130lbs, would multiply their body weight by 1.3 and will know the weight they would need to for their fingers to consistently pull on the crimps of a V14-15 climb. 1.3 x 130lbs would result in about 170lbs. 1.3 x 150lbs would result in about 195lbs. When you add the overall weight of both hands, thats 340lbs+. More then enough power to haul a 130lb climber up the hardest routes!

Preliminary results from the training log survey I received data for 105 training cycles from 20 distinct climbers (The majority of cycles from 2), and here are the preliminary points of interest:

* The pinch grip isn't very trainable.  I looked over every log I could find, and no one made "good" progress on a pinch grip.

* Max hangs beat repeaters.  I measured % change per workout, and max hangs beat repeaters soundly.  Also, max hangs beat the Lopez MAW-MED protocol.
* More workouts per week caused greater % change per workout.
* Less weeks per cycle caused greater % change per workout.  Very weak correlation, don't take it too seriously.
* Less total resistance correlated with better % change per workout.  Weird.
* The average climber can expect to get .5%-1% stronger per workout.

The take-away recommendations.  Train max hangs 2-3 times per week, on bad grips, for 3-6 week cycles.  Don't train pinches.

Fancy charts coming soon.  Raw data is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxdxxylejJ37SXpMU0Q1QURTZjg/view?usp=sharing).  Questions?
How do you climb when it's cold outside Living in Paris, I've heards about Fontainebleau's "collante" since I started climbing. Legends say when it's between 0°C (32°F) and 10°C (50°F), the rock becomes sort of sticky and makes the most heinous slopers feel like jugs...

I've never seen that because I only tried to climb in such temperature once and it was a nightmare : I never got warm, my finger skin hurt like hell and I couldn't decide between keeping my cold climbing shoes on but being unable to put any pressure on them or put them away, warm my feet up but let my shoes get even colder.

So, to put it simply, I had a terrible time and have no idea what I should have done to make it okay so here's my question : how do you make cold winter climbing bearable or maybe even enjoyable ? Assuming no money restriction when it comes to specific gear.
My notes from Neil Gresham Climbing Masterclass So I decided to binge watch those videos I'd heard so much about, and after just a few seconds of watching the first one, I decided to note anything that seemed worth remembering. So here are my notes, if they can inspire anyone to watch the videos or reconsider their training, then great !

**Stuff to write on your hangboard**

The ability to conserve energy by moving as efficiently as possible is always the drive of climbing performance. - EP2 - https://youtu.be/Z5tvCy9Qqk0?t=14s

If the mind won’t lead then the body won’t follow - EP2 - https://youtu.be/Z5tvCy9Qqk0?t=3m2s

Almost every climbers find they prefer certain types of holds to others. But if you continue to shy away from the ones you dislike, then the gap in your performance will only widen. - EP3 - https://youtu.be/fCcl3m-EXyg?t=1m3s

**Things I didn’t know, never really thought about**

The higher an undercut, or the further it is to the side, the higher it will be to use so it pays to make rapid and careful foothold selection in order to direct your hips and center of gravity towards the hold. - EP3 - https://youtu.be/fCcl3m-EXyg?t=5m36s

(Regarding side pulls) If you remember that the optimal position is when your forearm is at right angle to the hold then the rest of your body will naturally fall into place - EP3 - https://youtu.be/fCcl3m-EXyg?t=5m43s

The answer to perfect footwork is a silent first-time foot placement with no ankle bounce - EP5 - https://youtu.be/YLL7umVNEdc?t=3m

If the foothold is low down then flag in front, if the foothold is high then flag behing - EP8 - https://youtu.be/ts2jrYSsisA?t=30s

(Regarding foot cutting loose) Here I let my right leg cut loose first and this means I’m able to use body tension to control when my left leg eventually follows. - EP18 - https://youtu.be/UXNzqI4ohxU?t=27s

(Regarding deadpoint) At the point you catch the target hold, your hips should be exactly beneath it. - EP20 - https://youtu.be/g4E748X07dQ?t=2m8s

(Regarding dynos) It’s even more vital that your hips finish below the hold. - EP21 - https://youtu.be/Uhd-kUSJgqI?t=44s

When slab climbing, keep your feet at approximately shoulder width rather than stepping too wide, even if it means resisting the tentation to use larger foot holds. - EP24 - https://youtu.be/l25Cj4vnbNI?t=12s

The key is remembering that there are 2 definitive stages of a rock-over. First being the pivot accross and the second being the upward thrust. - EP25 - https://youtu.be/JiCeWxF7bHg?t=23s

The key to arrete climbing is to keep your feet high in order to maximize friction and maintain that stable tripod position. - EP26 - https://youtu.be/juMNJz7Wn6g?t=3m5s

**Things that are never said too much**

The first step (when trying to improve) is always to look at your technique - EP1 - https://youtu.be/nkfUqdr-0zk?t=1m18s

It’s always the new things that make you improve - EP1 - https://youtu.be/nkfUqdr-0zk?t=1m54s

The first link of the chain is always the fingers to hang the hold - EP2 - https://youtu.be/Z5tvCy9Qqk0?t=1m14s

(Regarding technique) The secret is to start focusing on the aesthetic side of the movement - EP5 - https://youtu.be/YLL7umVNEdc?t=22s

There are 3 general characteristics of good efficient climbing movement, which apply to all moves and all situations and these are : precise footwork, fluid movement, and correct pace. - EP5 - https://youtu.be/YLL7umVNEdc?t=1m2s

We allow ourselves far too much time to work out the next moveinstead of trusting our subconscious to guide us and this in turn forces us to waste so much energy as we hold static positions. - EP5 - https://youtu.be/YLL7umVNEdc?t=3m45s

(Regarding deadpointing) You must consciously remind yourself to stick to the foothold at the precise point when you move your hand - EP20 - https://youtu.be/g4E748X07dQ?t=2m5s

**Things worth keeping in mind**

The more efficient et relaxed you are the less tired you’ll become - EP2 - https://youtu.be/Z5tvCy9Qqk0?t=2m23s

Repeated heavy crimping can be stressful for the joints and tendons - EP3 - https://youtu.be/fCcl3m-EXyg?t=2m5s
Video Analysis- why you should do it Hi r/climbharder,

My name is Justin Wyse and I'm a competitive rock climbing coach and personal trainer. I coach for Team Earth Treks, and I mainly work with the competitive youth teams, but I love helping people improve in climbing in any way possible. I've been climbing, coaching, and competing for the past 10 years, and I've learned a LOT of stuff the hard way. Today I'm here to discuss the importance of video analysis!

This is the biggest tool I've found to help my kids, clients, and myself improve at climbing, bar none. Climbing technique is an enormous component of solid climbing performance, and I've found that people improve far more quickly when they get an opportunity to see themselves on the wall and have a coach walk them through their mistakes. Re-occurring habits might be noticeable right out the gate, footwork and COG placement is far easier to explain and show, and most importantly- I've found people climb a hell of a lot better and try harder if they know they have a camera pointed at them :)

Video analysis is something coaches do in literally every other sport- I remember football practices in high school that were EXCLUSIVELY dedicated to watching film and reviewing strategy and technique. For a sport like climbing that has such an enormous emphasis on technique, I find it shocking that more people aren't analyzing the living bajeezus out of themselves on a regular basis.

So let's get to it- post your videos/links to videos here in this thread, and we can start critiquing each other. If there's enough interest in this, I'd be willing to do it on a weekly basis.

A friendly reminder- this is an invitation to anyone working on any grade, Vintro through V13 and beyond. Please be civil in your feedback and critiques of each other- negativity doesn't help anyone improve, but constructive criticism is always helpful.

Conversely, if you're receiving feedback, keep an open mind. Everyone here is ready to help each other! Cheers!
Self Assessment: Understanding Strengths and Weaknesses Hi r/climbharder,

Two days ago I submitted a post about video analysis, and I was quite surprised at the positive response it received. I was super psyched to watch all of your videos and give feedback, and that in turn made me way more psyched to post here more frequently. So from here on out, I'll plan on posting at least one topic a week, every Wednesday, in an effort to keep this sub alive and kicking! 

This week, I wanted to discuss self assessment. The best coach will always be yourself. You might not have the information you need to get better, but you have the will power to seek it out and improve. If your heart is there, your body will follow. You won't always have a coach present. You might never have a coach present. Being able to coach yourself after each attempt is extremely valuable- you always want to be able to answer the question "why did I fall," so that you can continue to improve. If you don't have an answer to that question, then your attempt is essentially wasted. Since we discussed video analysis a couple days ago, I thought it would be wise to expand on that and talk about how to break down your videos and what to watch for on different climbs. 

Self assessment can be really hard if you're not used to doing it, so I have a couple exercises for people to try. First, pick your onsight grade in the gym- whatever you consistently onsight, not your highest onsight ever. Go around and quest that grade, repeating (or sending for the first time) as many as possible. Whatever feels EASIEST to you out of all of them (as long as it's not super soft) make sure you film yourself on that climb and write down the 5 topics listed below. This is a huge clue that there's something about this climb that you're inherently good at.

1. Wall Angle (slab, vert, specific angle beyond vert- 40, 45, etc.)
2. Hold Types (slopers, pinches, pockets, crimps)
3. Orientations (side pull/gaston/etc.)
4. Movement (dynamic, static, stemmy, etc.)
5. Total of attempts so far post warming up (this one is extremely important- a climb might just feel harder or easier to you if it's at the beginning or end of a session).

Whatever feels HARDEST to you (as long as it's not extremely stiff) repeat the same process- video yourself on the climb, and write down all 5 topics listed above. Somewhere in this climb lies your weaknesses, and you need to discover them so you can destroy them.

Size also plays a large role for inherent strengths and weaknesses. Here's a link of me doing some video analysis of myself on a climb, compared to someone much, much taller than me: 

https://vimeo.com/189017009

This climb is pretty far below what we're both capable of climbing, but a couple natural tendencies are highlighted in this video just depending on your size alone. Skipping holds and making much bigger moves is extremely crucial if you're a taller climber- whereas being able to match on holds and switch feet on nearly anything is super important for shorter climbers. Taller climbers should always look for opportunities to use their height to an advantage and skip holds, whereas shorter climbers should be ready to be dynamic, match anything, switch feet on anything, and use anything as an intermediate.

As suggested by many of you, I downloaded coach's eye and have been playing around with it quite a bit, so this was my first crack at it!

A final note- strengths and weaknesses change with time. It's important to run the above exercise at least once every 6 months or so to see where you're at and what needs work (or prior to any training cycle you might begin).

I hope this helps! As for the videos of your climbs that you crush at or struggle with, feel free to post them here or PM them to me. Again, this is an open invitation- I don't care if you're working on Vintro or (apparently now) V17, I want to help you get better! 

Cheers!

[Tools] Gripster 2.0 hey, hi.  

so i recently helped the good fellow responsible for the Gripster (AKA 'Mike') retool the design a bit.  i really like the balance of the OG device so my first priority was to bring the edge sizes in line with community standards (22/18/14/10) as well as offer a bit more scalability.  while the device was on the chopping block, i also considered adding a little deflection to the holds to counter the tilt under load.  we went with 15 degrees in hopes that we could eliminate the need for wrist flexion without forcing unnecessarily extreme finger joint angles.  Mike also smoothed out the lip of the edges for comfort while keeping sufficient texture under the fingers where - you know - it's actually useful.   

all in all, it's a pretty hefty upgrade.  

here's a [visual recap](http://imgur.com/a/wOSgG) of my description should that flavor tickle your fancy.

**ethical note:** i really love this sub and so I feel it's necessary to be clear about my monetary involvement with the project.  as it stands now, my only guaranteed compensation will be a set of free Gripsters and some swag.  while we have discussed actual loot transactions for my time, i'm mostly just happy to be involved in making a better tool.  as far as i'm concerned, anytime a core user can get inside a production process it's a bit of a coup.  in short, i'm not shilling.  i'm just trying to help make better stuff for fingers.     

if you're interested... here's a link to [actually acquire the thing](https://www.thegripster.com/the-gripster-2-0.html).
Message to The Gripster users Hi Folks, this message is to address everyone who recently purchased [The Gripster](https://www.thegripster.com/the-gripster.html) (original) now that [**The Gripster 2.0**](https://www.thegripster.com/the-gripster-2-0.html) has been released. I’d like to tell you that I know it sucks for everyone who just bought the gripster, I understand this may be frustrating for you. I'm sorry if this is the case. Here's why it turned out this way….


&amp;nbsp;


I wasn't planning on making any changes to The Gripster at all for a minimum of 6 months but more likely a year. In fact I was absolutely dreading the possibility, because getting access to the cnc mill then cutting, shaping and molding foam is a lot of work and gets super expensive real fast. But then disaster struck! My only mold tore. I was planning on making another just the same, but then I started thinking about all the suggestions people are making on reddit and since the silicone for 1 mold costs about $200 and it’s 2 days work (If nothing goes wrong) to get it just right, I wanted to make the best mold I could. Originally I didn't think I could make any changes at all as I don't have access to a cnc router anymore, but then I started thinking about it a lot and began to realise there was a way to make some minor changes with my existing tools without a huge expense, even though it’s taken me around 10 days of work plus one not so good mold ($200 of silicone down the tube there) to get it just right.


&amp;nbsp;


So I started and began to figure it out, I also needed to make some changes to my molding method and find a way to get the molds to last longer. I really didn't like the seam either. Having texture at the seam creates registration issues and since it's textured it degrades really quickly and eventually bits rip off and the seam gets worse and worse.


&amp;nbsp;


If it wasn't for my other mold ripping I wouldn't have made these changes at all, well not now at least.


&amp;nbsp;


I feel bad for the guys who just got [The Gripster 1](https://www.thegripster.com/the-gripster.html) but unfortunately it's just part of the process of evolution. I couldn't let the fact the some people had just bought one of my products become a reason not to improve the product for future customers. I’m learning more about how to make these molds better and better every time I make one. I'm sure many people have the very same conflict when new phones come out, or new versions of software are released and so forth. It's the same with medicine too, people get sick or die from diseases and then they find a cure or vaccine and have to think about the people they could have saved if they just found it a few years ago. Or the [shark proof wetsuit!!](https://youtu.be/DCIL2nvU4x8) This things amazing and I often think about all those folks who got bitten while surfing. Could have been avoided. Anyway I digress.


&amp;nbsp;


If you did purchase [The Gripster 1](https://www.thegripster.com/the-gripster.html) and now think you would like to get your hands on [The Gripster 2.0](https://www.thegripster.com/the-gripster-2-0.html) let me know. If I have any seconds in The Gripster 2.0 I will release those for cheaper. Sometimes there are minor defects that affect the aesthetics but not the overall functionality and those will be marked down and made available to prior customers. Email me through my website and I will put your name on the seconds list and send them out as I get then. 


&amp;nbsp;


Thanks to all my valued customers for supporting The gripster! 


&amp;nbsp;


I'm going to email the same message to all the folks who previously bought [The Gripster 1](https://www.thegripster.com/the-gripster.html).


&amp;nbsp;


Right now I’m not planning on releasing anything like The Gripster 3.0 for another 6 months to a year unless sales pick up dramatically or I get funding to scale up production. I’m actively seeking funding right now but until that happens I need to sell a bunch of Gripsters and start covering some of the costs I’ve incurred up till this point.


&amp;nbsp;


Mike
I finally climbed my first 7a (5.11d)! Here is what i've done for last 4 months 7a (5.11d does not have the same ring to it) has long time been my dream. I've come close few times: I've onsighted few 6c+ on climbing trips before, but every time I found myself on 7a, it just seemed impossible.


This last climbing trip I've done 2 of them, both on second go, one really close to onsinght, and they didn't even feel that hard.


Some background: I'm 29 years old, climbing since 2008 but had few long (more than a year) gaps where lost interest in climbing and tried other sports.
There are no natural rocks or boulders in 10 hour drive radius from where I live (that might explain my occasional lose of interest), so the only time I get to touch real rocks is climbing trips twice a year.
The only gym we have is a crappy and overcrowded bouldering gym (no lead).


Last trip (6 months ago) was hard: 6b+ (5.11a) was a huge achievement. This trip it was my warm up, onsighting all of them.


Some time after the last trip, I've installed a hangboard and started with some strength exercises. Here is how my routine looked like for the past 4 months:


Sunday:
7AM hangboard
12AM strength training


Monday:
5PM bouldering


Tuesday:
restday


Wednesday:
7AM hangboard
5PM bouldering


Thursday:
5PM strength training

Friday:
7AM hangboard
5PM bouldering


Saturday:
restday

hangboard routine looked like this: for each finger combination (all 4 fingers; index + middle; middle + ring) I would do 2 hangs for 10 seconds with all 3 hand positions (almost straight; bent a bit below 90 degrees; bent over 90 degrees). So 6 hangs for the each finger combination in total and 18 hangs overall. 1.5 minute rests between hangs


strength routine looked like this: muscle ups on bar (5x5), dips with weights (3x8) and bench press (3x8). Then I would do core exercises: L-sit (3x15sec), leg raises (3x12) and Russian twists (3x25).


bouldering session consisted of just climbing overhanging problems for 2 hours and long endurance climbs at the end of the session on slightly less overhanging wall.


A very important note is that I tried NOT to get tired after strength training, so I would have energy for bouldering. I took good rests of at least 3 minutes between reps and used weights that were below my limit. I've also tried not to burn out on bouldering sessions: I stopped while I thought I could try the problems few more times.


I'm returning to these habits till next trip, and hopefully someone finds this post useful too! :)
Performance and rate of adaptation Generally speaking, performance, rate of adaptation, and complexity of programming are all interrelated. This image is take from Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength and illustrates this:

http://imgur.com/mqHAUvn

How does this relate to climbing? Well, we know that one of the limiting factors on performance at upper ranges in climbing is grip strength.

This is why [Grippul's metrics are so interesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/51hhfz/grippul_strengthtoweight_ratio_for_climbing/) is because they show that grip strength is somewhat linearly correlated to overall bouldering ability. For example, in the above link, 30% of bodyweight on one hand is equivalent to about V3, 50% of bodyweight on one hand is equivalent to about V5, 70% of bodyweight on one hand is equivalent to about V7, and so on up to about V13 or so. 

Of course, this is a small sample size, and there are other factors such as core strength, leg strength, overall upper body strength, and such that are not accounted for. However, this gives us somewhat of a decently accurate summary on grip strength and performance.

What this would naturally look charted against the same chart above is here:

http://imgur.com/zpNygqf

Where the V-grade intersects with the performance metric is where you would "generally" be able to climb that grade.

In the example above, it would take 

* about 1.5 months total to go from V0-3
* about 4.5 months total to go from V0-7
* about 7.5 months total to go from V0-9
* about 12 months total to go from V0-11
* about 18 months total to go from V0-12
* about 24 months total to go from V0-13
* about 36 months total to go from V0-14 
* about 48 months total to go from V0-15
* about 108 months total to go from V0-16

Obviously, in a "real" climber this would be a pretty insane rate development, and I'm sure there are a couple of genetic freaks out there that have climbed similar to this schedule. Something more realistic would starting from the V0-2 range would probably look something like this:

* about 1-2 months total to go from V0-2
* about 3-4 months total to go from V0-4
* about 4-12 months total to go from V0-6
* about 9-24 months total to go from V0-7
* about 18-42 months total to go from V0-8
* about 30-60 months total to go from V0-9
* about 48-84 months total to go from V0-10
* about 72-120 months total to go from V0-11

However, the illustration of the point is that the first few grades of development take proportionally far less time than it does to advance at the high(er) grades of development. This is because rate of adaptation as you get toward genetic potential is logarithmic.

Anyway, not really sure where I was going with this, but it's a good visualization for newer climbers to understand. A newer climber going from V0 to V6 in a year might take another year to go from V6 to V7 or V8.  It's easy to get frustrated with plateaus and length of time to advance a "grade," but that's where good training comes into play.
Dropped the diet, results are not what I expected Have had an amazing week in climbing.. I have been on some form of Keto for nearly the past year, and always at a deficit.. I've been so afraid of getting heavy and climbing like crap that I don't think I've really been giving my body a chance for growth.. I don't know about anyone else with their dieting but it felt like it was pushing me closer and closer to an eating disorder. So I finally decided to ditch the diet, delete myFitnessPal and eat some carbs. It feels so good to feed my body!

 I definitely haven't been eating totally clean either, but I have basically just tried to make good food choices, save the junk for a treat  and not eat like an animal. Last time I weighed myself I had put on 5 lbs since changing back, and I was so afraid it would hold me back, but it appears to have  had the opposite effect. Saturday at the Gunks I Sent my first outdoor V7 (The Pearl) and finished another V5 (Did that one years ago) I'd been working the same day. Two days later at the gym hit my max hangs and then sent a Crimpy-body tensiony (my anti style) V6 after about 5 or 6 go's, a powerful compressiony V7 in two go's and finished another V5 i could not finish before. Probably the best two days of climbing I've ever had to date.

So I guess I'm just learning not to try and control everything, and to take better care of my body. I'm happier and my climbing is still improving. So do with that information what you will, maybe it will help someone else try something different.
Controlling and Initiating Swing As a short climber (5"2' on a good day) and former gymnast, I see both newbies and experienced climbers that have no clue how to start or stop swinging. I see on this sub a lot of advice for short climbers to "just jump for the hold." This is only half of the equation. Many climbers can reach the hold, but the feet are too stretched out to keep them on. 

 -stopping swing

There are several things I do personally when I catch a hold where my feet cut. First, I predict whether my feet will cut or not. Often, especially for short climbers, there is no avoiding this, and you just have to embrace it. when I catch the hold, I isolate my bottom half from my top half. I let my legs swing out while my core stays tight. This allows my upper body to remain more directly under the hold, and not experience as much centrifugal force. At the same time, I pull up on the hold I catch. This upward acceleration gives more grip, especially on slopers and crimps.

 -Initiating swing

There are times when initiating swing is very beneficial, and many climbers are not comfortable with swinging from a dead hang. I use a combination of core and arms to start swinging. this video somewhat explains what I mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvXdoh0znAQ
Timing hollow body and arch generates swing very quickly.

I hope this was helpful, I just think swinging is a topic that is not often discussed here.
Vertically Challenged Climbing I felt inspired by the post on [Controlling and Initiating Swing](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/5h3epm/controlling_and_initiating_swing/) to discuss climbing while vertically challenged. I see plenty of suggestions to maintain body tension, lock-off, or jump for the next hold. As it may become obvious (to the short climber), sometimes that's not actually useful advice because these are too vague to be actionable. I want to offer a different perspective to perhaps increase your repertoire in your next approach to a reachy crux.

-

Tall climbers, turn back, wear a shit-eating grin, and grab the next hold. Reading the following could be detrimental to your climbing. I'm here to talk to you about using your body as a lever, arguably the most distinguishable advantage a short climber has. I climb limestone sport and my inferences may be specific as such.

-


I'm going to generalize lever climbing in two anecdotes, because it is easier and more interesting to consume the concept in stories than pure theory.

-

*Using the arm as the lever*

Because of the shorter distance we have in our limbs, it costs less energy to use the body as a lever than taller climbers. This fact is the rub when climbers talk about body tension as it relates to shorter climbers. We can actually put off discussing momentum or swinging as lever climbing does not rely on it (it's the other way around). Consider pulling a bulge or a mini-roof: the terrain just above is typically slab, so the farther your initial reach beyond the lip, the easier the transition. This terrain may seem to be easier for reachy climbers, but often times, it's not. Rather than locking-off the lower arm or jumping, climb these sections as you would slab with arms fully extended and feet driving perpendicular to the rock. Just as in smearing slab or laybacking, you want to avoid peripheral footholds. Imagine yourself as a lever: your hands (the fulcrum) and your arms and shoulders (the lever arm). Body tension should result naturally. In this position, you can walk the feet up higher before overcoming the bulge, giving you much needed reach. A key beta using this technique is that the static hand must be able to resist outward pulls on the rock. These will be underclings, pinches, pockets, generally anything that is not negative. A good enough resistance will allow you to initiate a swing if you still cannot reach above the lip. You can apply the same mechanics to steep crux moves where tall climbers are stretched and opposing their centers of gravity with their limbs.

-

*Using the calf as the lever*

I think heel-hooks are where shorter climbers shine. The shorter distance from your heel to your knee and hips allow you to generate more torque as you have a smaller gear to crank. If you read the Self-Coached Climber, it means that a taller climber has to use a lot more force to enter a stable balance with a heel-hook because his center of gravity has to travel much farther during the move. When translated to rock, it means that you can start a heel-hook a hell lot sooner than a taller person; in many cases, before your face is level with the hold you are heel-hooking. The general advice is to try heel-hooks earlier than your taller counterparts for a reachy hold as you are far more likely to be in a stable position than them. It means that you will need strong core, especially obliques to bring your heels up high and trunk flexibility to boot, but that seems easier than trying to grow taller. It also means, that it pays more to you (than them) to learn to generate force on your heel in different directions and heel-hooking smaller holds. In addition, I find the shorter lever to the hips is much more forgiving when I want to offload my weight to the heel-hook. It frees up my hands or other foot to walk up the wall or mantle, when a taller climber in the same body position feels too “scrunched” or “cramped” to progress.

-

Thanks for reading, and read any criticisms below.

**TLDR: The shorter your limbs are, the easier it is to use them as levers. You will reach farther if you apply force on the end of your body levers than upwards towards a hold.**

-

Addendum:

-

*Vertical Terrain*

As difficult vertical terrain is generally unforgiving to outwards force, I find reachy holds in face climbing to be the most problematic. This is the terrain that I most often resort to deadpoints and dynos when I cannot reach a hold. I find that 90% of the reaches involve a deadpoint rather than an all-points dyno. My method of solving these types of cruxes is fairly straight-forward compared to the previous two examples, but is probably a lot harder to do while bouldering and onsighting than redpoint sport. I start with the position I need to be in after the deadpoint crux and work either one of my feet down to the lowest hold that I can be somewhat stable in. Remember that body position, and come back down to just before the crux. If it is comfortable to place the corresponding foot onto the foothold, then do it. When you deadpoint, imagine snapping your body into the new position rather than stretching for the hand hold. If you do it right, you will have placed your foot before the deadpoint ends, and won't waste any energy on trying to resist the feet from cutting. The key takeaway is that the body position you end-up in after a deadpoint becomes much more important if you have to deadpoint all the time.

-

*Rests*

Lastly, as a short climber, I fit into a lot more rests that taller climbers. It pays double for me to scout out potential rests on a redpoint project. Caves are obvious, so I will avoid discussing those. Often times, concavity between bouldery sections offer up good rests that is blind from the ground. These usually require your feet to stem the mini-dihedral that the concavity forms and sucking your body onto the wall. Another type of rest that I find myself using more than taller climbers is the rocked-on high foot. I'm guessing the shorter knee distance gives me more stability control than taller climbers. I can usually milk out an armbar, bear hug, or even a no-hands when taller climbers can't, so find opportunities.
What are exercises any climber, regardless of skill, should do daily? It doesn't have to mean purely workouts. Anything from stretching to antagonist training and beyond.
Goals for 2017? Title says it all! ☺

Let's write our goals for the year and then revisit the thread every few months to see how we are doing on them.

I'll start: 

Tick some more outdoors V6s and try the jump to V7 and V8.


Tick as many route 7s as I can (5.12s) and jump and start projecting at least one 8a (5.13a)

Don't get injured. 


Spend the summer in Spain and have an awesome time climbing.
Hey Climbharder Thanks.

You guys are great.  This is the best climbing site on the net, and it's because of the community that hangs out here.  Thanks to all the experienced crusty old guys for freely sharing their experience.  And more importantly, thanks to the enthusiastic newbies for pulling the knowledge out of the old guys!

I hope Sendta Claus brought all you guys big boxes of PR's and sick new projects!

The 3 Stages of Cultivation As we all know, Bruce Lee was the man. The following is from him, but is not necessarily an original idea. These three stages have been described in different cultures and in different forms of martial arts. Another version of this is the Japanese concept of "Shuhari". It is a rabbit-hole worth falling down.

Anyway, this has been very influential for me and maybe it will resonate with you: 

The Three Stages of Cultivation

The first is the primitive stage. It is a stage of original ignorance in which a person knows nothing about the art of combat. In a fight, he simply blocks and strikes instinctively without a concern for what is right and wrong. Of course, he may not be so-called scientific, but, nevertheless, being himself, his attacks or defenses are fluid.

The second stage — the stage of sophistication, or mechanical stage — begins when a person starts his training. He is taught the different ways of blocking, striking, kicking, standing, breathing, and thinking — unquestionably, he has gained the scientific knowledge of combat, but unfortunately his original self and sense of freedom are lost, and his action no longer flows by itself. His mind tends to freeze at different movements for calculations and analysis, and even worse, he might be called “intellectually bound” and maintain himself outside of the actual reality.

The third stage — the stage of artlessness, or spontaneous stage — occurs when, after years of serious and hard practice, the student realizes that after all, gung fu is nothing special. And instead of trying to impose on his mind, he adjusts himself to his opponent like water pressing on an earthen wall. It flows through the slightest crack. There is nothing to try to do but try to be purposeless and formless, like water. All of his classical techniques and standard styles are minimized, if not wiped out, and nothingness prevails. He is no longer confined.
[Promo] Will Anglin AMA - Sunday January 8 Climber, coach, setter, shaper, writer, 4:12 hangboarder, and Tension co-master (pause for breath) Will Anglin shall be joining us for a bit of the AMA game.  If you're not familiar with Will's work, then I urge you to mosey on over to his [website](http://willanglin.squarespace.com/) and take a long gander.  If the written word isn't your cup of tea, then maybe check him talking the climbing talk on both the [Training Beta](https://www.trainingbeta.com/media/will-anglin/) and [Power Company](http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/2016/9/29/episode-12-poe-with-will-anglin-and-rowland-chen) podcasts.

IMHO Will is one of the best minds working in climbing at the moment.  Not because he has the 'right' answers, but because he is an eager and ready student of the practice.  Will takes time to methodically sort through the complex entanglements of climbing without being unnecessarily rigid.  He appears willing to drop dogma in favor of data and drop data in favor of anecdote.  In short, there's a human quality in his work.  Dude is not just making training widgets.  He's in deep.         

We might drop the thread on Friday morning to let it populate while everyone is on the clock (CLASS WARFARE!), but we hope you'll be in attendance for the magic on Sunday.

[Discuss] Strength Assessment ## Background

We've long discussed the need for standardized strength assessments in climbing. While [others](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/5lrngf/matt_groom_of_epictvs_vlog_tom_randall_ollie_torr/) have collected this data, their results are private and thus of limited value to the climbing community at large.

I think we can do better. Our community has the knowledge, experience, and geographic reach to create effective assessments and to distribute them across the world (or, at least, parts of the USA and Europe). We can collect this data, gain experience, refine the tests, and keep everything public — benefiting the entire climbing community.

For starters, I've thrown together a simple finger strength survey (linked below) that asks:

- Some demographic Q's (height, weight, age, sex, etc.)
- Performance Q's ("current flash grade" in bouldering and sport climbing)
- Max strength (test = 7sec half-crimp hang w/added weight)
- Max endurance (test = 7sec repeaters w/bodyweight until failure)

## How it would work

- Post copies of the survey in our gyms alongside the training equipment (i.e. hangboards).
- Post a supplemental mini-poster/page providing additional detail about the project, including links to a sticky post describing the project, a webform for submitting data directly online, and the raw data itself.
- Provide pens/pencils and a dropbox so climbers could complete/submit results on the spot. (Someone would have to periodically collect and parse the paper surveys.)
- We upload the data (either directly submitted or parsed from the paper surveys) to a "shared database" — e.g. a public Google Sheet (?) — for analysis.

## To-Do's

- [ ] Agree on methodology
- [ ] Agree on survey contents/design
- [ ] Create landing page describing the study
- [ ] Create publicly-accessible page providing raw data

## Survey Drafts

- [Draft 1(Imgur)](http://imgur.com/a/gDw8S)
- Draft 2 — Uhhh... I seem to have lost the link. W/e.
- [Draft 3 (Microsoft OneDrive)](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AjP50VBhjzPOc2AT0zOB-NJWzE4)
    - Strength test changed to 7sec hangs
    - Adds a "Requirements" section
    - Calls out the "rules" for assessing reps
    - Specifies that the self-reported grade should be "Best send on rock"
    - Adds an open-ended question asking about the holds used
    - Asks for an optional contact email

AMA - Will Anglin Hey everyone,

Ask some questions and I'll do my best to answer.

Edit 1/9/17 : Thanks for all the great questions!
How can I get better at sloppers? Im pretty good with crimps and pinches but when it comes to sloppers I suck.  5.11d with mostly crimps is no problem, but 5.11 with all sloppers is the end of the world.  Tips?
Training Experience for Tall Climbers (6'4") I am helping put together a training plan for a tall friend. Here are his specifics:

Climbing 15+ years, mid 5.13 and V8-V9. Current goal is to boulder V10, with a Rocklands trip planned for two months this summer. He does not have any experience with climbing specific training such as hangboarding/campusing/etc (never tried weighted hangs). All of his previous training has primarily involved climbing outside, long bouldering sessions indoors, sporadic moonboard sessions, and some core exercises. He is slightly frustrated and stuck at a plateau, having bouldered at the V8-9 level for 5+ years. I should add that he has been relatively uninterested in climbing-specific training up until this point, but wants to try it out in order to overcome this plateau. He doesn't want to pay for a trainer or plan, so he has asked some friends for suggestions.  

It can be challenging to critique another persons movement, but here is what I notice: He has excellent technique, and climbs efficiently. He is able to use height and momentum to his advantage, and is able to skip smaller holds at times. His technique outdoors is fantastic, and he performs very well on slabs, vert, and overhanging terrain. It seems that he struggles with hard sit starts, what he calls "bunchy" problems, very powerful movements, and keeping tension through his body on powerful/steep moves. He is very good at using heel hooks/knee scums/etc to get through difficult sections. I think that for the grade he climbs, he may be relatively "weak" - so has the opposite problem of many climbers. An example of a problem that he has projected but not completed is Acid Wash Left, where he stuck the first move once, but couldn't get his foot back on (and he can do the rest of the problem consistently). 

Since he has relatively little experience training, it seems like he would benefit from standard workouts - max weighted hangs (Maicsh), campusing (Anglin workout 101 at first), moonboard (maybe focusing on problems with very powerful first moves) and an improved core routine. He has done quite a bit of core work in the past, but it was more volume focused. Also, it seems like he could benefit from hip mobility (maybe some of these? http://www.climbstrong.com/articles/20150925) and body line work. 

I am looking for specific recommendations about what exercises/concepts he should incorporate, and it would be helpful to get some feedback from taller climbers about things that have worked for them, especially with regard to maintaining body tension. Any opinions on L-sits or seated straight-leg raises for this climber? 

Thank you for any input.
Toe hooking, how does it actually work?? I've been climbing now for almost 7 years. I recently climbed my first 7b indoors. (I live in the Netherlands so cut me some slack, we don't have any mountains). I've picked up some training books and have become an enthusiastic self-coach and trainer. One aspect of climbing still eludes me completely. Too hooks, bicycles, bat hangs, you name it. As soon as the top side of my foot is needed, I'm all of sudden an absolute and complete beginner again. 

Since I'm mainly a route climber I don't get the chance to practice toe hooking techniques often, but when I want to use it I completely fail every time. I realized that I jus don't understand how the movement works. 

Where do you "pull" from? is it from the knees or the hips? or maybe the lower back? I've been trying it all, nothing seems to work for me. 

My questions to you hard climbers:

1) Do you now any good drills to practice the coördination of toe-hooking? Preferably suited for the absolute beginner level. 

2) Do you know any strengthening exercises that might aid toe hooking? 

3) Do you have any general advice regarding how to effectively use toe hooks?
Tale of the tape - results 2 I did a survey on [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/4lzn67/tale_of_the_tape_survey/) last year, and I've had another play with the data.

I've been doing a bit of econometrics work lately so I thought I'd have a crack at fitting an empirical model to the data to try to estimate climbing grade based on some of the variables that were surveyed. A lot of the data didn't really show a significant impact on climbing grade, but there is some useful stuff in there.

So for estimating V-grade

	                  |    Estimate	|   P value
--------------------|----------------|------------
(Intercept)|-4.57282|0.3448
height|0.06063|0.0602
weight|-0.03568|0.1087
5 plus years|3.55123|2.39E-06
2 - 5 years|1.34911|0.0411
1 - 2 years|0.83669|0.1925
3+ a week|0.87169|0.0821
Hangboard|1.25612|0.0148

So this tells us that being taller helps (adding 0.06 of a v-grade for every centimetre) weight does not help, you lose about 0.036 of a v-grade for every kg you weigh. 

Experience is very important, the baseline is anyone climbing for under a year, but if you're between 1 and 2 years, you can expect to be climbing nearly a v-grade (0.84) above the baseline, between 2-5 years you should be climbing 1.35 grades higher, and after 5 years, on average you should be climbing 3.55 v-grades harder than an entry level climber.

Those who climb 3 or more times a week would add on nearly a v-grade, and hangboarders on average are climbing 1.25 v grades harder than those who don't.

For route climbing I converted everything into the Australian grades. This was a better model than the v-grade model and also had some interesting results.

	             |     Estimate	   |    P Value
----------------|-----------------------|-------------
(Intercept)|21.19537|2.00E-16
Male|3.11279|0.00293
weight|-0.03335|0.16543
climb5plus|5.64528|8.24E-11
climb2.5|2.3951|0.00112
Climbing.Training|1.78294|0.0049

This shows that males climbed about 3 grades harder than females (interesting that there was no significant difference for bouldering). Again, weight doesn't help (but this isn't a very significant result either). Experience of over 5 years was worth 5.65 grades, 2-5 years experience was worth 2.4 grades. Hangboarding, weights and campusing didn't show significant effects, but those who undertook specific climbing training (4x4s or laps etc.) were climbing about 1.8 grades harder than those who didn't.

I tried adding up the variables that applied to me for both models (e.g. 21 + 3.11 + (73kg*-0.03) + 5.65 + 0 for climbing.training = ~ 27.5) and it was remarkably accurate for picking where I am at currently. I imagine it won't be accurate for everyone but give it a crack, I'd be interested to see what people think.

Edit to fix table formats
**Edit**

Models with BMI are [here](http://i.imgur.com/QyMKkGj.png) for vgrade and [here](http://i.imgur.com/ztSofcE.png) for route climbing. The model fit is not as good and the variables are not as significant. I don't think these will be as accurate, but might be better at the extremes rather than suggesting a 2 metre climber will automatically be awesome...
Climbharder training survey * [Survey link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciYaa2iX79npcnPBltM7kx4EMS317jpLjTz0pgogQBmfn0DQ/viewform)

After /u/callmeigor 'tales of the tape' survey and the subsequent discussion of results /u/eshlow came up with a few suggestions of questions for a new survey that was more training orientated to get some more data that was a bit more specific to training. 

I have put all these suggestions into a new google forms survey. 

Please take your time to fill it in and to share with your fellow climbers! 

* Thanks to everyone who has filled it out already, We have over ~~100~~ ~~200~~ 250 submissions! 

Edit: if you know anyone who climbs V12 and up I'd love if you could ask them to fill out the survey! We're lacking a bit at the top end of the spectrum!
The Rock Climber's Training Manual - One year in. Alright lads. 
Over the last year I've strictly followed the teachings of the RCTM and have seen significant improvement in all aspects of my climbing (12d to 13d) while learning a lot about training itself. I'm interested to hear of any thoughts, feelings, critiques or tips you guys have concerning the RCTM, regardless of your time invested in the program - I've certainly learned a lot about it in a year.
The case for aerobic training for bouldering Boulderers should be ARCing.  I'm summarizing the key points of [this StrengthTheory article](http://www.strongerbyscience.com/avoiding-cardio-could-be-holding-you-back/) because it's good, if you have 10-15 minutes, you should read it instead.  The article provides these points for general aerobic fitness.

* Strength sports aren't 100% anaerobic, more like 50 to 80% 

* When doing multiple sets, the later sets are more aerobic than the first.
*  You'll recover better between tries, better recovery allows more/better work in a given session.
Being stronger means you can expend more work to recovery from, so greater anaerobic strength requires greater aerobic fitness.
* Better recovery between sessions.

Cool.  So better aerobic fitness is good.  Here are the downsides:

* Interference effect.  Aerobic gains interfere with anaerobic gains
* Recovery.  Is it still a rest day if I ARC or jog?
* Time.  Steady state cardio takes forever.  Is it more beneficial than spending that time strength training? 

Solutions to the downsides:

* The interference effect can be minimized by separating strength work and aerobic work by at least 6 hours.
* If your ARC/jog/walk interferes with your recovery, it was much too strenuous.  Keep it light and easy, "conversational" intensity.
* 20-30 minutes, twice a week.  

Specific recommendations:

* Don't run, walk or cycle instead (or ARC for climbing specificity)
* 20-30 minutes twice a week
* Track your resting heart rate for measurable improvement
* If you resting HR is around 50, you're fit enough (for strength purposes)
* If you're regularly doing interval training (4x4's, Tabatas, etc), decrease aerobic volume a little bit.
* Do some strength exercises to failure, but don't go overboard

Now for the climbing specificity.  ARCing is intended to increase capillary density in the forearms.  This helps "flush" out pump, and oxygenate muscle tissue.  ARCing also increases the local aerobic capacity of the forearms.  Doesn't seem like a big deal for 4 move boulders, but somewhere between 10 and 30% of the total energy expended in a 20 second exercise is aerobic.  Taking your aerobic fitness from laughable to world class could give a 30% increase in apparent strength on a 4 move problem.

At high intensity, blood flow occlusion occurs in the forearms (no blood in or out).  When climbing, there are often micro rests when a hand is moved or when a given position is much less strenuous for one hand.  These short breaks allow some blood flow into the forearms, and increased aerobic fitness lets you get more recovery out of each short break.

The aerobic contribution to strength exercises increases towards the end of a workout.  So having greater aerobic capacity allows you to get more quality attempts on your proj per day.  Which gives a better chance of sending, and allows you to rack up more quality miles of climbing, which increases skill and strength stimulus.

TLDR; ARC 20 minutes, twice a week.  Take a 30 minute walk once a week.  Learn to enjoy long approaches (lol).  Send your proj.
[Discussion] Hangboarding - max strength and long term gains Reading over a recent thread /u/straightCrimpin made a fairly poignant [remark](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/5rf46c/the_rock_climbers_training_manual_one_year_in/dd7dgo5/). Max weight workouts, in general, are highly recommended on this subreddit. Personally, I've seen great gains over using max hangs and weighted min edge hangs. 

I wanted to start/continue a discussion about the costs/benefits of these types of hangboarding. Perhaps we can put our minds together and come up with a better protocol for our current and future climbing selves? [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/4mzxyt/lets_discuss_hangboarding/) thread is an excellent start to the discussion, but I think it might be time to go into even more depth on the subject.

I've always wondered about long term improvement with primarily using max hangs for training finger strength. While they area great for developing maximum finger strength, I'm not sure about their efficacy for long term improvement because of a lack of hypertrophy. The benefit of repeaters is the necessary high metabolic stress required for hypertrophy. If I understand correctly, over time increased hypertrophy leads to increased strength because of added cross-sectional muscle area.

These statements require certain assumptions based on my understanding of current strength research as it relates to climbing:

- Hypertrophy is highly beneficial to long term climbing improvement
- Repeaters provide the necessary path to hypertrophy while max hangs do not
- Max hangs are better for maximizing strength within the given limits of current muscular development

Is it possible to design a training cycle that maximizes both gains for the long term (repeaters-hypertrophy) while also maximizing our sending capability for the current season (max hangs-strength)?

This past cycle I utilized max weight/weighted min edge with great success prior to a bouldering trip. The large difference was that I continued my max hangs during the power phase, rather than just weighted min edge hangs. As necessary, I added weight to both holds. Borrowing from conjugate periodization, this structure seemed to give me a longer strength peak while working my power.

This next cycle, I've been considering starting my hangboard phase with repeaters rather than max hangs. As the power phase nears (2-4 workouts?), find a reasonable way to start incorporating some form of max hangs into the sessions. Perhaps, doing one to three reps of max hangs after taking a 10-20 minute break post repeaters? The transition idea needs some fleshing out. It might not even be necessary, but I think priming the body for intense max hangs during the power phase is a good idea.

The plan is to use this transition from repeaters during a strength phase into max weight/weighted min edge during the power phase. The idea is repeaters start building a strength base for long term gains as well as the current cycle. Moving into max/min hanging pushes these gains to their limits for the current cycle (and potentially the future).

After these phases one could move on to power endurance/anaerobic capacity as necessary.

- Does this idea seem reasonable or like it is trying too much in too short of a window?
- Has anyone experimented with such a strength/power workout breakdown? What were your results?
- Any ideas on a way to streamline the transition between repeaters and max hangs?
- Other comments or thoughts on such a protocol? I'm not sold on it, just trying thinking about how we can make best use of the benefits of both styles of hangboarding.
The downside of having a bouldering wall in your garage... It's been a month or so since I finished my small garage bouldering wall, went route climbing last night for the first time in 3 weeks and realise why I should've been training endurance instead of trying to put up stupid hard problems!

Hard bouldering is great for strength, and I'll continue to do it (just less often) but I must make myself do more intervals as my main focus is sport and trad climbing 😀
[Meta] The next Big Thing... We've made a lot of progress in this sub over the past few years, traffic has more than doubled in the past 12 months, and from my perspective at least, interest in climbing training is at an all time high in the community!

Rather than rest on our laurels, I'd like to create some discussion about what we should do next (that answer could be "keep doing what we're doing"). What new features would you like to see? What about something fun and community specific? How can we make the experience in this subreddit better? In short "What's the next big thing for r/climbharder"?
Results from Climbharder #V3 survey - Demographics and Predictors of Climbing Performance Hi everyone, 

/u/higiff was very generous and shared the results of the survey he carried out here with me so I could play around with the data with the condition that I share my results. Well I have no problem with that!

Here is a link to the survey: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciYaa2iX79npcnPBltM7kx4EMS317jpLjTz0pgogQBmfn0DQ/viewform (please don't take it agian if you already have taken it).

Unfortunately, there is so much to look at that I cannot post it all easily in a reddit post or all at once. So what I have started to do is do some analysis and make a short "paper" on the analysis. These "papers" are not super pretty or well explained: I am a bit notorious for not explaining things properly, so feel free to call out anything you think is confusing. 

There are probably also plenty of things I could improve upon, (e.g. format, content, and grammar). Feel free to give me suggestions.

Without further ado, here is what I have put together so far:

Demographics:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6yGsEhKdFOpdlhUbHloMFRUY3c/view?usp=sharing

This paper shows the demographics of the study. e.g. how many respondents are female? How long have they been climbing. It also has a section on interpreting some of the results I will post about in the future, but I am sure that there are better resources out there/people will have suggestions on how to make that section better. 


High Level Predictors of Climbing Performance:


https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6yGsEhKdFOpbWg2V0NZMGhXSk0/view?usp=sharing


This one is way more interesting. Here I look at what high level variables predict climbing performance  (e.g. demographics and frequency of climbing and training). In the future, I want to look at the specifics (e.g. type of hangboard training and endurance training). 

&gt;It’s well known that certain demographic and training habits predict climbing skill (as measured by best
grade climbed 90%). Here, I look at the data from the climb harder survey to see to which variables best
predict climbing skills. The number of years climbing experience, and biological gender strongly predicts
climbing skill. Training frequency also strongly predicts climbing skill: high skill climbers tend to climb
more frequently, hang board around 2 times a week, campus around 1-2 times a week and may engage
in some sort of strength training.

&gt;BMI, weight, height, arm span and APE index do not significantly predict climbing skill. Endurance
training is also not a good predictor of climbing skill.

I was surprised to see that endurance training did not significantly predict climbing skill. Does that mean endurance is not a useful thing to train, or is it simply a less popular training method for advanced climbers?

More to come in the future, so please leave any suggestions/critiques/explanations here.

[Goals &amp; Strategy] Using Long &amp; Short-Term Redpoint Pyramids Or : how to send projects without serious mega-effort 
Bonus or : How The Stig in a '98 Camry runs a faster lap than Stevie Wonder in a 458

Motorsports analogies aside, I'm really into this topic and decided to write about it for all of you. Im gonna touch on a few things said by others as well as provide personal experiences as to how I used this strategy to great effect this winter season. 

What is a redpoint pyramid? It's quite simple. Over the course of a given amount of time, you aim to climb a number of problems in a pyramid style. If your goal is to send 1 V5 you might attempt to climb 3-5 V4, 5-9 V3 and 8-12 V2. This can be done in a week, a month, a season. Alternatively, if you're a solid V5 climber, you can use the pyramid in a quick session as a form of volume workout. I'll be touching on it as more as a strategy to sending your goal route.

The Long-Term Pyramid : Get obsessed. It's worth it. I have this weird obsession with my pyramid now that has had serious influence on how I schedule my outdoor days that's led to significant performance gains. I look at it on a career-long basis. It can also be viewed season-long, trip long, month-long, what have you. Basically, don't try any one boulder too much and don't try to skip grades or put a serious, long-term effort into a boulder that's possibly out of your pay grade. Experience, skill and technique gained from climbing a volume of sub-limit problems can be so pivotal to enhancing your actual rock abilities that your time is better spent sending a huge stack of easier hard boulders than banging your head on a difficult project. This balance is going to vary a little for everyone and you need to find your sweet spot. Bottom line : projects are important. So is volume. Find the balance the gives you the best performance. 

This rule is much less applicable to those who are already elite-level performers. If you're sending V11+ regularly, flashing or session-redpointing V10+, flashing V8+ with serious consistency, you can get away with breaking this "rule". Chances are at this level that you're really fucking good and you've got your feet wet and sharpened your teeth on a serious volume of boulders. It's no coincidence because acquiring that level requires probably like 300+ boulders V7 and up. This is why Nalle can get away with Lappnor and still flash V13. He's a freakgod. Chances are you're not.

This leads us into the Horst "3 try rule" that we've heard on podcasts and in articles. It's total bullshit. 3 tries is absolutely nothing. I can think of boulders I've finished where I've done the crux move less than 4 times in 15+ attempts. 3 times were in isolation and the 4th was on redpoint and I got hyped as fuck and sent. This can happen within a session. The rule appears to be more like "use your best judgement and know when you're in too deep."

Pringle was asked about this on TBP and responded with an analogy of skateboarding. Skateboarders will try a trick so many times before they ever do it, far more than 3. I imagine when Rodney Mullen was inventing flip tricks he had to try them A LOT. To expand this analogy and tie it back in, if a street skater wants to backside flip a 12 stair, he needs to have the prerequisite skills down : the 12 stair Ollie, the kick flip, the 180, the backside flip and the control to skate fast enough to go 12 stairs. Even if he has the prerequisites down, the full package 12 stair backside flip is gonna take a lot of fucking tries. The better the basics are dialed in, the faster he'll pull the trick but it's still gonna take investment.

As always, find your sweet spot. Speaking for myself, it takes me a lot of attempts and potentially several sessions to really dial in specific movements. Once I have them dialed, I can execute them pretty consistently, but I need the initial investment to make the "is this worth projecting?" assessment. I typically allow myself several sessions on a problem, regardless of difficulty, before I make a judgement on whether it's manageable within a reasonable timeframe. If it isn't reasonable, it's likely to detract from my overall skill, or be time better spent elsewhere. 

I know a lot of climbers that have 10 or less V7, a few V8 but they really wanna climb 9/10 so they just try it to infinity. Yea, they'll do it eventually. You try any boulder enough and you'll probably get up it. I imagine this is seriously stunting their growth as a climber and inhibiting their performance on any bloc that isn't their project. You can spend 2 months trying at your limit and eventually do it. Alternatively, you can spend 5 weeks climbing a pyramid, send blocs, develop skills, learn to apply your strength and then spend 3 weeks on the project and you'll probably do it in less time AND have done other boulders which has boosted your skills, strategy and technique. 

Last season I was this climber. It wasn't very successful and I'm wary of falling into this trap again. I spent all winter trying v8/9 projects, I did a few of them but seriously neglected the base of my pyramid. I was sending harder, but I was arguably no better than I was beforehand. I learned some valuable redpoint strategies the hard way. Apparently, climbing more rocks makes you better at climbing rocks. 

The Short-Term Pyramid : this is the meat and potatoes of how I've structured my outdoor sessions this year and it's been wildly successful. I like to call it "Consolation Prize Bouldering." 

Basically, you treat every day as if you were to climb a limit boulder pyramid. It's pretty self-explanatory. Let's say your goal problem is V9. Try it first and work it. Once you feel regression or fatigued in those specific movements, walk away. Try to walk away fresh. Then go try problems in decreasing difficult. These are your "consolation prizes". Try an 8, a 7 and a 6, or 2 V7. You're gonna do these problems. If not that day, within a session or two. Working new moves, trying new styles, all that good skill-diversifying stuff. This also has the added bonus of momentum. It's talked about a lot in ball sports, where a player or team is "on fire" and is just unstoppable. You're gonna ride the wave of successful performance to the top. This also opens the door to having hugely successful days. With this strategy, I was able to have my best days ever, 32 points in 4 problems, 24 points in 3 problems. This style of outdoor "programming" led to my first 9 in a session, my first 8 in a session as well as my first V7 flashes. 

Here's some juicy anecdotes : 

Early in the season, I was trying The Vagina V8. A lot. I was making a little bit of progress every session but once I was 10+ deep, I hit the wall and was stale, burn-out and frustrated. I wasn't trying any other projects and I wasn't climbing easier boulders. I'd get wasted on it and then go try blocs which were just as hard or harder and there was no success. I took a 2 week hiatus from trying it, climbed a solid volume of V5-8 and then came back and fired it 2nd go after a warm-up. This was also my first double 8 day. The emotional effects and success practice from climbing a pyramid is not to be understated. Know when to walk away.

Anecdote #2 : Biggie Shorty V10
I tried this boulder early in the season and it took me 2 sessions just to pull off the ground and size up for the crux. Last year me or not pyramid-focused me would have just kept trying and eventually banged it out 4 months later. Instead, I walked away. I climbed a huge pyramid using the consolation prize strategy and came back riding a huge success wave. (I had also made some pretty solid 8mm edge gains that played a part, but not as significant as redpointing other hard boulders, imo) I climbed my hardest-to-date in a quick ~6 sessions or so and using the consolation prize strategy, I also took down several other hard boulders during those 6 sessions. I walked away fresh enough to try other things and left the project alone before I was practicing fatigued movement patterns. 

Point being, I could have climbed the boulder in 20 sessions if that's all I was trying. However, I was able to climb it in 6 and many, many other boulders by taking a pyramid approach. 

Tl;Dr : climb lots of things. Know when to walk away. Realize when you are capable, but the time commitment may be detracting from your overall skills. 

I'm certain this is not news to many, but I hope there are some valuable info-nuggets within
What training have you done, that wasn't worth doing? Thinking about making better use of my time, and I was wondering....

Knowing what you know now, if you were starting training for climbing again, what things that you used to do, would you not bother with second time around?

For me, spending too much time lifting weights. Last year I was doing 2-3 workouts a week, but now I do 1, maybe 2 and mainly focussing on stability exercises instead of absolute strength.
Tension Climbing [custom] Hey everyone. I wanted to reach out and let you know I am able to do custom work through my company Tension Climbing. If anyone is looking for specific edge sizes or other training gadgets, shoot me an email (will@tensionclimbing.com) and we can work something out. 

I can do pretty tight tolerances which is something I thought you fellow nerds would be psyched on :)
[Wisdom] What's your biggest training takeaway from the past two years? Inspired by the great discussions in a recent post asking [what training wasn't worth doing](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/5vtcdm/what_training_have_you_done_that_wasnt_worth_doing/), I thought I'd throw out another open-ended question:

&gt; **In the past two years**, what are the **two most important things** you've learned **about training for climbing**?
Modified my old Metolius wood grips compact board. Now it's got a 16mm grip at the bottom, and the slopers are shoulder width apart.
Free climbing training routines and progress tracker Hi all,

[Technique] Round Table Wedesneday I want to kick start a round table on technique here to promote sharing of knowledge. I am going to reflect on my thoughts, ask questions, or spray on technique in the comments and encourage others to do the same. My thinking here is that Wednesday is a good day to reflect on the week for most of us weekend warriors. Hopefully, it gathers enough interest for it to occur on a weekly basis.

This might also be a good place for ideas for posts, videos, or podcasts on technique since there are some folks here who are talented in that respect.
Looking for feedback on my training program Thank you for taking the time to have a look at my training program. I appreciate any feedback you have for me.

#1. Background

I started climbing routes casually in the gym in 2005 at age 16 and continued to do so until about age 18 where I was probably climbing around 5.10+/5.11-. At age 18 I started to climb more often and switched over to bouldering. At age 19 I sent a couple V5s outdoors. Starting at age 20 my climbing became less consistent due to school, work, and other life events. I would have periods where I would climb often and others where I wouldn't climb for months. At age 24 I finished school and got a job at a climbing gym and since then my climbing has been pretty consistent besides a few months off here and there. At age 26 I sent a V8 outdoors in an hour or so. And currently, at age 27, I regularly send gym problems rated V9+/V10 in a session.

I have been a gym rat my whole climbing career. The few outdoor sends I mentioned earlier make up the bulk of my outdoor climbing experiences. And, up until about a year ago my climbing training has only consisted of limit bouldering with some unorganized pullups, leg raises, and dead hangs sprinkled in when I felt like it.

A year ago I started researching climbing training and started experimenting with different programs due to feeling like I have been plateaued for a while and that my age is starting to become a limiting factor.

#2.Goals

I would like to be a solid 8A(V11) boulderer both indoors and out. And, if I can accomplish that, then I would like to be a solid 8A+ boulderer, and so on. Basically I want to push my bouldering abilities as far as I can.

#4. Closing Questions
1. What are your thoughts on the effectivness on this training program given my goals?

2. Do you think this program is sustainible, could it be done year round?

3. Do you think this program has enough time for recovery?

4. Do you think there is there too little climbing relative to training in this program?

5. What would you keep and what would you change in this training program?

Thanks again for taking the time to look at my training program I look forward to seeing what you think.
How important is deliberate low intensity, high-ish volume bouldering for long term progress? I'm not just talking about junk mileage for the sake of junk mileage.

I'm asking because after having been chasing the holy grail regarding training. 'What hangboard protocol?', 'What supplemental exercises should I do?' etc. I finally realized that just climbing more would work best for me.

So since realizing this I've been going every other day (mostly just limit bouldering) as opposed to 2-3 times per week. Short warm up and then I feel like it's time to find something hard to throw myself at.

I have seen a lot of progress (much more than I had hoped in such short time) but my elbows are starting to feel it a bit. I reckon it's because I climb at my limit constantly.

Should I consider throwing in some lower intensity days (climbing a V or two lower than my limit) just really working on honing my movement? Would this also help my progress or is it just time wasted (that I should rather just spend resting my arms)?

Thanks in advance

How to Practice Effectively, According to Science [Here's a link to a good TED Ed video summarizing the science of practice.](http://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2017/03/06/518777865/the-most-practical-tips-for-practicing-according-to-science?ft=nprml&amp;f=1039)

They cover a lot of things that get mentioned in this subreddit like developing neural pathways, the importance of quality sessions, etc.
Thoughts on pinch training So pinches are a major weakness of mine and I know that pinch training has taken some flak here about not being effective. 

In particular I have seen several people that have observed really low gains using pinch block(either deadlift or hangboard). I have seen similar behavior in my experience as well. My other grips add weight and the pinch grip never really seems to change that much. 

The more I think about it though it seems more like a physics problem in that pinch blocks kinda suck. Unlike the other grips we don't have a good way to measure the force being exerted, instead we are measuring how much weight to keep the block from slipping. I went and used my pinch block and tried to determine the slide angle on my forearm so I had a nice idea of the friction between skin and the wood block(albeit forearm vs handskin) and maybe my block was extra smooth and slippery but around 10-15 degrees was the slide angle. Which mean  the coefficient of friction is about .21.

So say I can pick up the block with 30 lbs underneath of it. That means I need to pinch with roughly 150 lbs of force. If I add 5 lbs to the weight I take that to 175 which is way too big of a jump for realistic training. Even using 1 lb increments you are increasing the force by 5 lbs each time, and you are way more sensitive to humidity and skin hydration vs other grips due to the multiplying effect of the friction.

I am curious if the gains are there but are being hidden because we don't realize what a force multiplier friction is, and poor overloading since it is hard to accurately hit the right weight.

To that matter I am trying to eliminate friction from my pinch block by angling the faces to make both sides slightly incut. Much easier to grip but that is fine just increase the weight. Friction is no longer the main factor since the block has to force the fingers apart to slide down, so I think you could get better training. There is the argument that you should train on bad holds to get strong but I think in this case the better training/measurability will out weigh that. 

Thoughts?

What is the optimal amount of recovery time? #1. Introduction
 
One part of climbing training programming that I have always struggled with is knowing how much recovery time is optimal. I always worry that I'm either not training enough or that I'm not taking enough time to recover to maximize my gains. From talking to people and looking at various training plans there seems to be a lot of variation when it comes to this so it's hard to know what is the best course of action. Some people seem to see results with a lower training volume while others seem to see results with a higher volume. For example, [Jan Hojer](https://vimeo.com/66473915) has said he trains 3 to 5 times a week for 2 hours at a time, while [Dmitriy Sharafutdinov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLpC3BLw_QQ) has said he trains all day 5 days a week, and both have had great success with competitive bouldering. Even when looking at individuals who aren't as advanced I know some people climb 2 times a week and steadily improve and others that climb 6 and steadily improve. So, the goal of this post it to lay out some accepted training theory and studies that we can all build on with our own experiences to hopefully come to a more clear answer on what is the optimal amount of recovery time.
 
#2. Supercompensation
 
"Supercompensation is the post training period during which the trained function/parameter has a higher performance capacity than it did prior to the training period." The phenomenon of supercompensation is foundational to athletic training. If another training period takes place while an individual is in supercompensation their body will advance to an even higher level of fitness. But, if another training period takes place before or after an individual is in supercompensation overtraining or lessened gains may occur. So the basic goal then is to program training in such a way that we are always training during supercompensation, not before or after. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercompensation) 
 
When the body goes into supercompensation after training depends on the type of training that has occurred. Looking at this [graph](http://www.lactate.com/images/olb_ch1_04.gif) we can see that the more intense the training is the longer it takes for the body to supercompensate, with supercompensation occurring in as little as 8 hours after "extensive endurance" and as long as 72 hours after "intensive strength training."
 
#3. Experimental Findings
 
These are a few studies that I was able to find that looked at how rest day programming effected training outcomes. This list certainly isn't exhaustive so please mention any others you know of.
 
[A meta-analysis to determine the dose response for strength development.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12618576) - This meta-analysis found that for untrained individuals working each muscle group 3 times a week was optimal, and for trained individuals working each muscle group twice a week was optimal.
 
[The distribution of rest periods affects performance and adaptations of energy metabolism induced by high-intensity training in human muscle.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10848646) - This study found that there are greater performance gains when high intensity training is done with rest days between sessions.
 
[Planned Overreaching and Subsequent Short-term Detraining Enhance Cycle Sprint Performance.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25958945) - This study found that performance gains were increased when individuals trained  maximally for multiple days in a row but then took multiple days off in a row.
 
#4. Application to Climbing Training
 
From what we have so far we can see the optimal amount of recovery time is going to depend largely on the type of training. Someone ARCing will need far less recovery time than someone doing max hangs, and this seems pretty obvious. But, what is less obvious is exactly how much recovery time optimal for all the various forms of climbing training, and should recovery time be a complete cessation of any sort of training or is some form of training during recovery acceptable.
 
Pulling from the supercompensation graph above the amount of recovery time needed for different forms of climbing training may look something like this.
 
| **Type of Training**             | ARCing | High Volume Routes/Boulders | 4x4's/Power Endurance Intervals/Strength Endurance Fingerboarding | Strength Training/High Intensity Fingerboarding/Limit Bouldering/Projecting Routes/Campus Board |
|------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Recovery Time Needed (Hours)** | 8-30   | 24-48                       | 40-60                                                             | 48-72                                                                              |
 

#5. Closing Thoughts
 
While I think it is common knowledge that the higher intensity the training the more recovery time we need I wonder if we underestimate how much time we really need to supercompensate from some of our more intense forms of training. For instance, if our main goal is to increase our maximal strength and power, which I think is the case for a lot of us here, would we be better off dropping down to something like 2-4 high intensity training session a week.
 
Please share your thoughts and experiences on what is the optimal amount of recovery time.
Phil Watts Appreciation Thread I just wanted to take a moment and show some appreciation for an American researcher who has pushed rock climbing research way beyond where it started a few decades ago. Dr. Phil Watts has been an amazing resource not just for me, but for almost every climbing researcher to date. I don't think I've come across a single climbing-related paper that doesn't reference one of his published studies. 
I suggest everyone take a look at some of the things he's done! From being one of the first to gather anthropomorphic data on climbers in the early 1990s to determining how blood lactate response changes with experience and grade and publishing a paper refuting handgrip dynamometry as an acceptable means of testing climbing hand strength; the man has done so much for our little niche sport. 
Here's a link to some of his published works. Its a treasure trove of good information. https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Phillip_Watts3
How structuring my climbing makes me stronger and more motivated in my first year. tl;dr: I structured my climbing in the first year and saw a huge uptick in my rate of progress, using a regimen that only involved climbing.

The generally accepted wisdom on r/climbharder is not to train in the first year, just climb. I'm quite Type A, and I'll admit, I craved some way to feel as though I was "training" since I started climbing in late Octover '16. Using information gleaned from the wiki and various threads, I developed a training plan that **only involved climbing** in preparation for my first real trip outside this past weekend. What I hope others will get out of this is a way to bridge the gap between "just climbing" and true "training." For two months before my trip I did the following each week in addition to outdoor bouldering 5-6 times:

* One day of bouldering, evenly split between limit problems (V6/7 boulders, attempting each move 10-15 times) and repeating boulders at my absolute limit (V4/5). All bouldering was done on overhangs of 45°+.

* One day of climbing volume. 20+ routes, all within 5 grades of my flash limit. (For a flash limit @ .11a, climbing .9, .10a, .10b, .10c, .10d) At least half of the routes were overhung by at least 15°. These days, I did at least two ARCs. A typical example would be 5.10b up, 5.6 down, 5.10d up, 5.6 down, 5.10a up.

* One day of projecting routes. I would pick a route graded 1-3 grades above my flash limit that addressed a specific weakness, then project and send it that day. I would never work a project more than one day unless I found it extremely compelling. I would also repeat the route the next week in order to help my brain retain beta, giving myself a maximum of 3 attempts to do so. These routes would generally be either vertical or slab, and I focused on technique above all else.

The idea was to get in some maximum-power training on day 1, power-endurance on day 2, and develop technique on day 3. I also bouldered outside 5-6 times during those two months (weather is still an issue) to get used to moving on real rock. There is no appreciable "before" data for outdoor sendage, so here is what I can measure:

Skill | Before | After
---------|----------|----------
Indoor Bouldering Max | V4 | V5
Indoor Bouldering Flash | V2+ | V4
Indoor Lead Max | 5.11c | 5.12a
Indoor Lead Flash | 5.10b/c | 5.11a

On my sport climbing trip, I was able to send every route I tried in two attempts or less. I spent almost half of my time working a project 5.12a. I sent it from the second move up. By the time I learned the first move, I had bruised my fingertips too badly to continue climbing. Climbers who worked it with me guessed that the second move up goes at about 5.11b/c. I'm extremely happy with how the trip went, and I honestly couldn't believe how close I came to sending 5.12a. 

Let me know what you all think of this. Again, what I hoped to get out of it was a way to go in to the gym with a purpose, despite being too young in climbing age to really, truly train. I hope it's useful to others in a similar spot.

Nutrition: Eating Your Way to Better Climbing http://www.rockandice.com/rock-climbing-training/nutrition-eating-your-way-to-better-climbing?page=1

This is neither my article nor did I make the original post, but I saw this on /r/climbing and thought this community would definitely appreciate it.
Training How To Try Harder? Coming back from the gym today, I had a question pop into my head: Am i trying hard enough? I came to the conclusion that I'm not. It feels like I'm soft and my body doesn't feel like it's on the same page all the time.

Do you guys try hard every time? How do you do it? Can you tell me how to get better at trying hard? I feel like I'm missing opportunities...

I know it sounds stupid...
A fitness tracker for indoor climbing that automatically logs your climbs Hey Y'all,

tl;dr; we're working on a [fitness tracker](https://youtu.be/tzwVAFALxZU) specifically for indoor climbers and we'd love your thoughts.

For the past several months I've been working with a buddy on building a fitness tracker for indoor climbing. The goal is to automatically log each climb attempted, flashed, sent, etc. in the gym so that we can focus on climbing and less on data entry. I think there's a lot of interesting statistical information that you can gather from this data, and it might even help determine how effective our training programs are. After a few iterations of the tech we've actually found it to be surprisingly accurate and we're finally getting it down to a size that can actually be worn. If you're curious you can [check out this demo video](https://youtu.be/tzwVAFALxZU). We'd love to hear your thoughts, good or bad, and any suggestions you have (especially from the perspective of climbing training).

edit: There's also a much more information on our website too: http://www.climbalytics.com/

[Logs] Q1 2017 Training Summary, w/High-Frequency Hangboarding ### Background

This post summarizes the results of my training from 01/2017 to 03/2017. This was my first really serious training program, with a mix of goals that included rehabbing a finger injury and increasing finger strength, as well as improving general strength for powerlifting and weightlifting.

The basically weekly structure amounted to 14-18hrs/week of training or practice structured as follows:

- Mo: Rest
- Tu: Supplemental Training (morning); Moderate Climbing (evening)
- We: Easy Climbing
- Th: Supplemental Training (morning); Moderate Climbing (evening)
- Fr: Rest
- Sa: Hard Climbing
- Su: Hard Climbing; Supplemental Training

Supplemental training varied somewhat, but generally included compound barbell or weighted bodyweight exercises like cleans, deadlifts, presses, pull-ups, and dips. Additionally, I'd work in max hangs alongside supplemental training and before climbing.

In the first half of the program, I'd max hang Tu/Th/Su for 4-5 sets x3 grips (open-crimp, half-crimp, drag; in the second half, I switched to Tu/We/Th/Sa/Su for 1-2 sets x2 grips (open-crimp, half-crimp). The handful of times I felt too tweaky to max hang, I'd either cut the intensity or skip the session altogether.

### Results

#### Hangboard

[Chart: Hangboard Training — Jan to Mar 2017](http://imgur.com/a/bdNr6)

- The data consists of 12 weeks of hangboard training split into two six-week blocks:
    - Weeks 1-6: Max Hangs Tu/Th/Su for high volume (4-5 sets x3 grips)
    - Weeks 7-12: Max Hangs Tu/We/Th/Sa/Su for low volume (1-2 sets x2 grips)
- Load is expressed as total poundage (bodyweight plus weight added) held for 10sec with a strict half-crimp grip. I switched from 18mm to 14mm during the program; the loads have been normalized to 18mm by adding the difference in my 18mm and 14mm PRs at the time of the switch (~18lbs).
- Half-crimp strength improved significantly in both cycles:
    - Overall: +76.5lbs (+40%)
    - Weeks 1-6 (RF): +32.5lbs
    - Weeks 7-12 (HF): +44lbs

#### General Strength/Fitness

- I gained a bunch of weight: 165 -&gt; 186 (+21lbs at 6'0")
- Other lifts also improved significantly:
    - Bench: 185 -&gt; 240 (+55lbs)
    - Pull-Up: 280 -&gt; 321 (+41lbs)
    - Deadlift: 425 -&gt; 465 (+40lbs)
    - Press: 135 -&gt; 170 (+35lbs)
    - Powerlifting Total: 1,030lbs (325/240/465)
- Improvement in the bench seemed to translate directly to steep climbing, where I felt I could better stabilize my torso. The press and pull-up also translated to more confidence in gastons and shoulder moves that previously felt tweaky.

It's worth nothing that I periodized these exercises separately from hangboarding, essentially in three 3+1 blocks (three weeks overloading, one week deload per block). Most heavy exercises were done for sets of 3-5, while lighter or bodyweight exercises were done for sets of 6-12. Towards the end of the training cycle, I started experimenting with max-rep sets to cap off workouts. These are super fun and are a great way of forcing overload, so I'll definitely be including them in future training plans.

I'll also add that I basically wrote off the deadlift, thinking that it would take too much work to push it past 425. I kept it at what I considered a maintenance level, with workouts like 3x8x345 (in retrospect, pretty hard). That PR came out of nowhere.

#### Climbing Performance

My climbing performance basically compressed, with better average performance and lower peak performance. I never felt as strong as the few times earlier in the year when I climbed V10, though I think I am a better climber now and have increased my capacity for hard climbing.

- Base level increased from V6 to V7: I could consistently walk into the gym, regardless of fatigue level, and climb all the V7s.
- Typical session level increased from V7 to V8: I would consistently climb all new V8s in one session when relatively fresh.
- Peak level decreased from V10 to V9. This is a bit deceiving, however, as I did virtually no projecting during this period.

(Note: Those are gym stats — I only rock climbed a handful of times, sending V6-8.)

### Takeaways

Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress I made during this training cycle. I struck a nice balance between training for climbing and for general strength/fitness, fully rehabbed a finger injury I suffered back in November, and made modest improvements in my climbing ability.

I feel like I've learned a few things from this training cycle, namely:

- Ironically, I don't take numbers posted here all that seriously. Both my numbers and those of the hard climbers I know in real life are pretty modest in comparison to the numbers you'll find on the web (or in self-reported studies; cough cough RCTM).
- Climbing is much more fatiguing than supplemental training. It was better for me to manage fatigue by climbing less than by hangboarding less.
- Long bouldering sessions actively hurt my progress. Shorter climbing sessions are much less tweaky.
- It's _possible_ to max hang almost every day. The reasoning is straightforward: those are tiny muscles incapable of producing significant systemic fatigue, so the only limiting factor is connective tissue health. If you're not an idiot, you can manage that.
- Barbell/compound-only training at low reps leads to some gaping fitness holes. For instance, throughout this cycle I learned that I have a significant abdominal/back muscle imbalance, and that my general work capacity is garbage. In this new training cycle, I've added more bodybuilding-style training to address some of those problems.

Anyways, I've already written a ton and there's still so much I could write about: exercise selection, fatigue management, program design, how to practice, etc. Hopefully some of that stuff comes up in comments/discussion.

If I could say just one last thing, it would be to look at the stuff Juggernaut Training Systems is doing with weightlifting — weekly video reviews of practice, long-term periodized strength training, technical analysis of efficiency — and to think of how you can apply that same rigor to your training. I've read a ton of books on training, and none of them have made these concepts "click" as well as what JTS is putting out.
5 years off after V10: will it all come back? Hey all,

So here's my climbing story. Trained hard for about 5 years, and gradually moved from V4 to projecting and sending a few V9s, and a couple of laughably soft V10s in Squamish (sorry if the post was misleading). Injuries prompted me to take a few years off, wherein I lost a ton of weight due to bike racing, gained it back in grad school, and then lost some of it bike racing again. Here I am, just about to turn 30, and looking to ditch the bike for a few seasons and focus on running and bouldering. 

Well, I'm heavier now — about 165 at 5"11 (I was probably more like 150-155ish when I sent V9/V10). I've been back at it again and have clawed my way back from pumping out on steep V2s to ticking off a few V5-V6ish things in the gym (hard to say—no traditional grade scale at my gym, The Hive in Vancouver). It's coming back, rapidly, but still feels like a long way off... 

My question is: anyone ever risen from the ashes past 30 to hit a new benchmark? I figured, at one time, that climbing V10 again might be impossible, but maybe not? I live in Vancouver, as mentioned, so have access to a place called Squamish that's apparently pretty good ;) 

Anyone have a similar tale? What did you find really made the difference, for you, in terms of training and lifestyle? I drink more than I did at 25, so there is that. Anyway, I'm new here, so, hey.
Biggest difference I have noticed between great climbers and everyone else... So besides them obviously being able to send stuff a lot harder,  I've noticed that their technique never suffers (or at least not in a noticeable way), even when at their limit.

I was climbing at my limit yesterday, and right before falling, I was doing all kinds of desperate smearing... not pretty at all.  Is this also you?  The videos I've seen of the great ones, when at their limit, they basically fall from a still well-executed move.  Not me at all most of the time.

Is this something they do but we just don't see?  Any thoughts?  Any tips on how to climb hard and not let technique go to throw crapper?
Climbharder Survey results Hey Climbharder, 
a while back I posted a survey and over **370** of you have filled it out. I promised that I would make the results free to everyone so here they are!

As always, if you haven't done the survey yet, it can be reached *[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciYaa2iX79npcnPBltM7kx4EMS317jpLjTz0pgogQBmfn0DQ/viewform)*

/u/Fmeson did a great job analyzing some of the data and completed two in-depth analyses. The demographic analysis can be found *[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6yGsEhKdFOpdlhUbHloMFRUY3c/view)* and predictors of climbing skill can be found *[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6yGsEhKdFOpbWg2V0NZMGhXSk0/view)*

Another user by the name of /u/williazo created a live interactive page that lets you compare data pulled straight from the results table. It can be found *[here](https://williazo.shinyapps.io/rockclimb_Shinyapp/)*

I've had a play around with some of the hangboard data, *[here](http://docdro.id/GuZRra5)* is a graph of %bodyweight added vs Max V grade added. I plan on doing a similar one for Minimum edge soon.  

Anyone feel free to use the data to analyze or what not, but please credit myself for creating the survey! Also share to your friends so we can get some more data! 

Cheers,
Mental cues for climbing Growing up I played a lot of golf, and I would always try to have a single mental cue that I would focus on during my backswing (they were different depending on the day/shot/etc..). 

I'm looking for something similar with climbing. In a recent thread /u/hosebeats (quoting another user) mentioned trying to 'break footholds off the wall', and I've found that to be super helpful with body tension on hard overhung moves.

If you have any similar tidbits, I'd to love here them.
I would like to start some light finger board training I have scoured the interwebs for newbie hangboarding protocols, and I just seem to get more confused the more I read. 

In short, I am 32 years old, been climbing for about 2 years. I just climbed my first 5.12 (indoor) and have climbed a couple of v5s. I would say my flash level is at about v3 and I can send most, but not all v4s within a session.

My goals are

* to remain injury free
* to continue to enjoy climbing
* to do more outdoor climbing
* to get stronger and improve technique however gradually.

The most sense I could get from the interwebs was to try to limit the number of holds I do to about 3 or 4 essential ones and to make sure that I am sufficiently warmed up before hangboarding. 

What I would like to know is:

1. Should I hangboard after a climbing session or before a climbing session or on a day that I do something other than climbing?
2. On the rock prodigy, for example, which 3 or 4 holds/pockets should I do?
3. How many times a week and for how many months should my hangboard program be?
4. Should I use a pulley system to take weight off while hangboarding? If so, how do I set it up? (is there a video link someone could give me?)
5. Is there a simply program I could follow, or could someone recommend number of reps, how long a rep is, number of sets, and rest times?
6. How can I ensure that I am using the correct finger position (i.e. not half-crimp, etc)? Are there videos or articles with diagrams to follow?
7. Which hangboard should I use?

A slightly different question: Is there a general consensus about the effectiveness of a maxi-pull board, such as this one [link](https://imgur.com/lwjSG5k)?

Thanks!
Survey about your favorite climbing shoes (x-post from /r/climbing) I'm collecting data about foot shape, and the types of shoes you all like 

https://goo.gl/forms/CdvIWEEBNrottQA03


Later you'll hopefully see some results to recommend shoes based on your foot shape, shoes you like, and the data that others provide.

The plan isn't to replace in-person testing of shoes. You should still always try a shoe, hopefully in a climb, before buying one. This is to just give a starting point in finding that perfect heel, and so you don't have to spend hours at your climbing shoe store trying on every shoe imaginable.
[Mental] Confidence &amp; Momentum We've all been there before, balancing all our weight on a tiny foot smear, slowly shifting to the side attempting to grab the next credit card hold. Things may look fine on the outside, but on the inside we're nervous, shaking, we don't trust the foot to not pop out from underneath us, we're breathing more heavily than we should...then the foot blows and we hit the mats.

Fast forward ten attempts later. We place the foot and shift our weight over in one fluid move, effortlessly grabbing the credit card crimp. Nothing could be easier. We don't feel tired, we weren't shaking, we weren't breathing heavily, we weren't even thinking about the foot, much less thinking about how afraid we are of it popping off. When we didn't think about it, the foot was solid and we did the move, when we did think about it, we got nervous and the foot blew.  So what changed? We didn't get stronger in those 10 attempts, the beta was the same, the conditions aren't any better. All that changed is that we gained confidence. Initially we were afraid of falling, or at least spent a lot of time considering the possibility, and it became a self fulfilling prophecy. When we stopped thinking about falling the move became easy, we could stand on the foothold no problem.

Our confidence, or lack of it, propagates through every problem we try, through our entire session, and we end up with a great session or a horrible one. If we're feeling confident and we flash the first boulder, we save energy, that extra energy helps us flash the second boulder, and it ripples through our entire session giving us great attempts, not wasting energy, and we leave having performed wonderfully.

On the other hand if we're not feeling confident, maybe we slip 5 or 6 moves in on a move that should have been easy. Since we know we can do the boulder, and we should have flashed it, we get back on, having to climb those same 5 or 6 moves again, our fatigue is mounting which is contributing to us falling. The more we fall, the more our confidence drops, the more our confidence drops, the more we fall, and the vicious cycle continues until our session is over.


So, lets assume we accept the premise, that confident climbing is more secure, better, climbing; then how do we improve our ability to climb confidently? How do we improve how often we're able to get into that mindset, or improve our ability to jump into it even if we're having an off day?


**Edit: Despite the poor example above, I'm not talking about improvements gained through muscle memory and repetition. Let's assume the two examples take place on the flash attempts of two different but similar boulders to get the possibility of motor learning out of the picture.**
Research seems to tentatively suggest gelatin supplementation and very short (6-10mins) periods of exercise can promote tendon health/injury recovery.

Another article suggesting lower rep counts https://www.t-nation.com/training/tip-how-athletes-should-train-for-gains?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=article5854


Referred to as Cluster hypertrophy for athletes 

"The short-term benefits are pronounced, but what if this is taken long-term?

Jonathon Oliver et al put this to the test, and after 12 weeks found a greater increase in power, a greater increase in strength, and similar lean mass gains in a cluster group vs. a traditional group. In other studies, clusters showed greater volume load (as traditional got so fatigued they had to drop weight).

So, if you want to preserve and optimize explosive power during hypertrophy training, look no further than cluster training."
[Discussion] Questions to ask yourself while you're projecting I've been doing a lot of thinking about my climbing lately and I've been inspired to really hone in on the mental part that comes with our pastime. What we do has so many moving parts, physical and cerebral, and we're *#blessed* (jk) to have such a helpful community here. 

A previous r/climbharder thread, "[Mental cues for climbing](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/66qwu8/mental_cues_for_climbing/)" motivated me to start thinking about what goes through our head when we're projecting. For all of our efforts to train, get stronger and push ourselves physically, the mental part can't be ignored as well. It's a great thread to help push ourselves just a little bit harder to get to the next move. That addresses individual moves, but what about the project as a whole?

[Falling is obviously a large part](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/1d/af/3d/1daf3d526ee51a8ff6e0d8ffe452bab3.jpg) of our game as well. 

An old post by Will Anglin on his old site talked about questions he'd ask himself whenever he comes off of a problem. I'd love to reference that when if he reposts it on his new site.


Are there questions we should ask ourselves when we get spit off of a problem or route? 

* Is there something that I could have done differently?
* Did I get enough sleep? 
* Are people watching me? 
* Are the planets aligned and is mercury in retrograde still in effect? 

All joking aside, I think the questions we ask could go a long way towards developing beta that works for you. It could help us project smarter, and climb more efficiently.

Apologies if this all seems a little scattershot, but I'd like to see what you ask yourself when you're projecting at your limit. Maybe this might be too broad of a question, but I think it warrants a discussion. Hopefully.
Climbing ability = (some large number &lt; 100) % finger strength. Thoughts? I've been climbing roughly 9-10 years now. That has included a lot of indoor climbing, trad climbing, offwidth climbing, some alpine climbing, ice climbing, sport climbing, and bouldering. At the moment, I predominantly only care about the last two.

Throughout that time, supplemental work I've done to improve my climbing (other than "just climbing/bouldering") has been limited to strength training, and weight control. In the past 3-4 years, I've also gotten much more into cardio/running, however that was mostly to improve my ability to pursue alpine endeavors, and then eventually just because I enjoyed it.

Only in the past year have I more actively pursued very climbing specific training - i.e. hangboarding, ARCing, power work, etc.

Based on my observations of other climbers, and my own experiences, I keep coming back to one conclusion: Once you've made significant gains in the technique arena (that is to say - technique is a lifelong pursuit and full of subtleties as climbs get harder, however - once you truly learn how to climb and stop being inefficient, this becomes less of a factor, imho) - climbing is in a major, major way - all about finger strength.

While the plural of anecdote is certainly not data, how many of you have experienced or noticed these trends? (I'm going to focus on bouldering in the gym for a minute, but I've seen much of this outside.) Have you seen someone who looks skinny fat and devoid of muscle, walk a hard problem? Have you seen someone who looks like they could stand to lose some pounds, and easily do so by following roughly any diet out there, still crush V10+? Have you seen someone who looks absolutely ripped and muscular, though not over sized like a body builder, flail on V3? (or fail, not flail, on V5, with reasonable technique?)

In my own experience, when I finally followed the RCTM plan, I made massive gains from the strength phase alone. I took a "cheat day" around 2/3 of the way through this phase and just bouldered in the gym. Problems that would previously have crushed me just felt easy. I feel as if my technique clearly could not have made major gains during this time frame, and yet climbing felt totally different.

Personally, I had quite a bit of strength training in my background before I had ever tried climbing, and it was something I pursued for quite some time during my climbing career before it eventually became way more sidelined, and then targeted and kept to a minimum. I feel as if the majority of the training podcasts and blog posts you hear/read that discuss deadlift, pullup, bench, etc...as weaknesses for climbers, are addressing the many climbers out there who have never in their lives really hit the weights. The numbers you need to hit to achieve true competency for climbing are really quite low for those that don't climb and are just pursuing the strength/lifting game.

While I'm sure that hitting the true ceiling of climbing performance does in fact require quite above average core, pressing/pushing, and "rear" muscle chain strength, I'm at this point in time convinced that, were you to apply the Pareto Principle to climbing hard sport/bouldering grades, it all comes down to:

1. Technique
2. Strength to weight ratio (i.e. lose as much weight as you can, given the genetic constraints of your body)
3. Finger strength

... and that as long as your level of achievement for categories 1 and 2 are reasonable, 3 will dominate, by a long shot.

Thoughts?
[Technique] How do you guys train it ? How do you actually train your technique ? Like precisely...

It's a very broad question that calls for just as broad answer, but I'm really wondering how you guys actually train technique !

I've been doing volume days, but I frequently end up cheating my way through harder moves with strength or power... I've tried to focus on sticky feet/hand kind of stuff while warming up... Overall I feel like the lack of feedback loop makes it very hard to self-assess if I'm doing good during an exercise, and if I'm improving long term.

So, what do you do to make your technique better ? What exercises ? How do you ensure you actually are using good or better technique when doing them ? How do you measure your improvement over time ?


EDIT : Synthesizing what's been said in the comments below, feel free to comment, add details or discuss

---

# Repeat problems

Some people call for limit problems, other for flash/onsight level problems, and most drills are just ways to make an easy problem specific to a move or harder and repeating it multiple times.

The goal and focus should be on doing the moves better every time, thinking about what could be improved.

Partner and/or video would help to spot mistakes and possible adjustments but repetition in high volume should promote intuitive improvement.

# Acquisition and Stress Proofing

Kind of the same idea of most technique drills : doing a move in an easy setting until it's done perfectly and then making it progressively harder while trying to keep perfect form.

This requires a wall on which you can set your own problems or a system wall of some kind in most cases, unless it's possible to use surrounding holds to try moves.

Here as always friend or video would help too, especially when comparing success and failure in different settings.

# Ego Check

All drills aren't going to do much if you end up cheating your way through just so you don't fall in something you should flash easily if climbing normally. The goal is to train, falling on a move is part of the learning process and ego must be left out of this all.

Partner can help ensure you don't find excuses for not doing the exercise properly on all moves.
Training Inspiration Like the title says, I watch these to get psyched for training. Post other high-quality vids if you got 'em.

[Story &amp; Discussion] Climbing Harder vs Climbing Better Hi r/climbharder,

I've been meaning to reflect on the mindset &amp; differences between focusing on climbing harder and focusing on climbing better, through my own experiences. I think it's important to choose a healthy, sustainable mental approach to climbing (and everything in life), and I wanted to discuss what can happen when an unhealthy approach is chosen for an extended period.

If anyone else has gone through a similar experience, it'd be interesting to hear about how you dealt with it or are currently addressing it. I'm also curious about the community's thoughts on creating a separation between what it means to climb better, and to climb harder.

If you want to skip the story bit and go into the discussion, that's cool too.

Thanks for your time!

Let me tell a story of a 14 year old who had been climbing for around a year with questionable success. It had taken him 4 months to send V4 outside, and he'd been making great strides in learning dynamic movement.

One day he was working a problem with his instructor. His instructor sent the problem, and he decided to copy his instructor's beta.

He fell.

Frustrated, he asked his instructor to explain why he fell. His instructor replied, "There was nothing wrong with your technique. Unfortunately, I was able to do the move that way because I'm stronger than you."

The kid took this to heart and vowed that this would never again be an issue. He never wanted strength to be a limiting factor.

He did not have access to a weight room, so he spent that summer in the climbing gym campusing. One hour was spent climbing, the other hour was spent campusing, until he could campus every route he could climb on every overhanging wall in the gym.

He would do one-arm declines and fail at one arm pull ups repeatedly for months, until they became second nature and part of every climbing session.

At the end of the summer he could climb V7 outdoors. Every day he thought about those words his instructor had spoken to him, and he realized that he hadn't made enough progress. He was still too weak for many climbs.

So he spent a few years doing the most powerful, physically demanding moves he could. Almost all of his session was spent on the 45° wall, making increasingly difficult moves. He spaced holds further and further apart until they were near his wingspan.

His high school had a weight room, which he visited almost every day. He worked weighted pull ups and learned how to muscle up. He worked up to a 1.5x BW bench press and double bodyweight pull up. He was able to do 25 one arm push ups and weighted one arm pull ups. He was strong.

Then during a break before he graduated, he went on a trip to Hueco. He was working double digit V grades and climbing single digit V grades in a few tries.

Then injuries set in.

He missed around 2 years of climbing, living a sedentary lifestyle consisting of sitting on his ass, getting involved in a dubious relationship, and struggling through university.

Depressed, he returned to climbing. He was astounded to figure out that he'd lost 15 pounds during those 2 years, and had maintained the strength to do a one arm pull up.

He could climb the V3 to V5 circuit by pulling his way through everything. He was still strong, so he could still climb hard.

His fingers rapidly grew stronger as well. But this time he was an adult (albeit a very young one). He'd learned from his mistakes, the many years of avoiding stretching, not understanding how to employ correct posture nor the importance of technique for staying healthy and mobile.

He educated himself and changed his mindset. He rapidly improved, and in 8 months adter his return he'd been able to win the regional Tour De Bloc (Canadian competition circuit), while being physically weaker than before.

He then surrounded himself with those who would push him to work on his weaknesses. He learned **how** to learn proper technique. He learned how to find flaws within his own climbing. He learned how to become analytical. He learned *patience*.

He learned how to climb **better**.

The next year he repeated his win at the regional Tour De Bloc. He's still got atrocious hip mobility, the tendency to rely too much on his fingers and pull strength, and countless flaws with muscle engagement. These lessons had taken him 8 years of climbing and growing to learn.

He can't do multiple one-arms anymore. He can't bench 1.5x BW. He can't bang out a dozen muscle ups.

But since I've learned to climb better, I'm climbing harder than ever before.
[SERIOUS] Benefits/drawbacks to climbing "quickly"? Every climber has their own style, right? It's all fine and dandy, but lately, I've noticed an increasing number of climbers, boulderers and route climbers, moving through their lines INCREDIBLY quickly. I'm talking Sonic the Hedgehog, gotta-go-fast, F-Zero speeds. 

There's no real noted similarity of physique for those I've observed, and admittedly, it's just within the immediate area I'm in. I have a friend who climbs 5.12/13 regularly and speeds through his routes like crazy. My younger brother is on the shorter side and sometimes moves as fast as he can. 

Adam Ondra is a prime example of this. He moves quickly and without hesitation. But that's Adam Ondra. 

Physiologically, is there an advantage to this? For me, I slow down and try to measure out the precision/strength I need to make it to the next move, especially if I'm going to be I need to make a dynamic move into a shallow pocket or something like that. 

Does it have anything to do with confidence? Muscle memory? Does it actually help save energy by moving quickly and with conviction? Am I being the one who's suffering from moving at a measured pace?

Curious about your thoughts!

When does physical strength become redundant? Hello r/climbharder!

After recording [this video of a "max weight" OAP](https://www.instagram.com/p/BVfYgX-lllu/?taken-by=kilgour22), I started to become curious about when strength training is no longer required for **anyone**.

For me, a 1RM for a OAP is around BW+40lbs. In the video, I'd climbed two days in a row with max hangs, campusing, and weighted OAPs prior to filming it, so I was in no shape to be doing a true 1RM.

For bouldering specifically, is there any actual need to be able to perform anything harder than 1 limb with entire bodyweight? Maybe I'm missing something obvious, but I can't think of an instance where I would ever need the amount of pull strength demonstrated in the video.

Note that this doesn't apply to finger strength, for what I think are fairly obvious reasons.

It seems like there is a lot of emphasis placed on always being stronger, and I feel like once a OAP can be done, the usefulness of further pull training could be called into question. I think the same could be said for core strength, as well...

Is anyone able to provide perhaps a physiological answer, or have any studies been done about this? Maybe some of the stronger or more knowledgeable climbers in the community like u/cptwangles or u/eshlow could shed some insight on this?

Thanks!
I did it... I hung a 20mm edge for 10sec with one arm for the first time in my life. So I can't whine about not being able to do that anymore.
[Web App] Bouldering Grade to Max Hang Hey crushers,  


this is a little web-app that I wrote because I had to learn this stuff anyway.  

You enter your max-hang numbers and your bouldering grade and it gives you what other climbers in your grade-range can hang and shows you a graph of what people can hang at what grade.  

/u/higiff kindly agreed that I put in the data he collected in this sub a few months ago. I cleaned it a little bit and now it gives you a nice overview of hang numbers and corresponding V-grades. The app gets better the more people use it of course!  

For those who can't hang bodyweight for 10 seconds from an 18-20mm edge, there is unfortunately no way to enter data (as the form doesn't accept negative values) but there is a button to "just see results" which gives you the graph without entering data.  

Otherwise, this thing is pretty self-explanatory. If you want to re-enter your data you can do so but please choose the same nickname as before.  

Note that this is all running on free services and that there is a time limit for shinyapps. People can only use the app for 25 hours a month (combined) so just enter your data if you like and see the results but make sure to close that tab as soon as possible.  

If the allocated time runs out, I could repost it next month. I also have access to the data and can post some analysis if there's an interest.

If you have any questions, just ask!  


Enjoy:

6 Month Training Logs Review Since Mid summer has happened, I figured it would be a good time to make use of my training logs and actually go back over them carefully and see what I could learn from them. I figured I'd share my analysis, as well as seeing what you all like to log in your books, as well as finding what more information I should be trying to accumulate.

One thing I definitely realized, is that a Google Doc is probably not the most efficient way to log all this. I'm still looking, so I'd love to hear how you log it all.

**Consistency:**

- Total climbing session time: 150+ hours in the gym

- Average session duration: 2.5 hours

- Number of climbing sessions: 65 sessions

- Number of Training sessions: 46

- Number of lifting sessions: 36

- Number of hangboarding sessions: 32
 

**Hangboarding:**

- Personal Record: +60lbs for 10 seconds

- Total time under tensions: 938 seconds

- Average TUT per session: 29.3125 seconds

- Average Sets per session: 3.355

 
**Summary:**

*Things I did well:*

- Averaged over 1.5 hangboard sessions/week

- Improved hang numbers

- Improved OA pulling strength from barely being able to hang one handed, to being able to consistently control a OA negative

- Found a couple core workouts that I actually will do

- Consistent climbing time. Averaged 7.5 hours a week of climbing without counting weekend climbing.

*This I can improve:*

- Not getting inured.

- More effective hang sessions, with more sets reaching proper TUT.

- Build better hang base, aka don’t push for max as fast. I reached +60lbs added, but was extremely inconsistent in time down to 40lbs added.

- More consistent core training with more volume.

- More focused skill training, better direction on what I need to be focusing on, aka projects, power endurance, strength, small holds, movement styles, etc.

- Find a lifting schedule I’ll actually stick to. Find lift to prioritize.
Calling all vegetarians/vegans! Hi all! Over the course of the past month, I went from eating a lot of meat to eating no meat, going vegetarian/vegan about 50/50. I wanted to see if any other vegetarians or vegans here had to up protein intake to compensate, or anything else of that nature. Thanks!
"So one of my favorite exercises on the campus board is 1-5-9" -Adam Ondra https://www.epictv.com/media/series-home/adam-ondras-training-series/500537

"If I can do 1-5-9 then I think, that, I'm kind of fit and strong." 

As an ardent /r/climbharder reader, I'd agree with that assessment. Apparently he likes 1-5-9 double dynos too.
Bouldering vs Weightlifting and CNS fatigue The title is probably a bit confusing, but I couldn't fit everything in a short description.

So, to start off, I come from a weightlifting athletic background if we disregard the sports I did before that (too long ago to have an impact). I had been weightlifting for many years and recently quit in April to focus more on bouldering, which I've been doing for over a year at this point. 

I boulder about 3~4x a week, doing sessions anywhere between 2-4 hours depending on many factors (general energy level, muscle soreness, mental power, skin etc.). The sessions start with stretching and a warm up on easy routes before hopping on to harder routes (usually after 30 minutes). I don't do any additional training besides the bouldering itself. No pull-ups, no push-ups, no hangboarding or campusing. I try to incorporate all styles of climbing during a session; Slab, face climbs, overhangs. Also many types of climbing: compression, slopers, crimps, volumes, balance etc. 

Now, today I wanted to test my strength levels to see how, if at all, they were affected. To my surprise, I was (almost) at the same level of strength as when I last went to the gym. This includes the squat, deadlift, clean&amp;amp;jerk, bench press and weighted pull-ups. I also have to say that my weight has stayed the same over a period of about 2 years now. I find it weird that despite not using any weights or other specific resistance exercises I've managed to maintain the same strength levels, which is not the case from taking a 2~3 month break from lifting normally. 

So I'm actually starting to wonder now if doing supplementary exercises when your strength and fitness base is pretty strong makes any sense.


Then there's the second issue I've been struggling with (sorry for the long post). CNS (Central Nervous System) fatigue caused by excessive climbing. Now, in weightlifting there is definitely a point in time that you will notice no progression, you might even lift less and be more tired for no apparent reason. Grip strength might also decrease. With climbing 3~4 times a week, I feel like a similar thing is starting to manifest itself too. However, trying to read up on anything about this will yield not that many results. I have come across [this article](https://www.trainingbeta.com/why-do-i-suck-at-climbing-some-days-2/) which does manage to go into this, but I haven't actually heard it from anyone who's been climbing (even at high levels). Though, if I compare my mental state now to when I was climbing once, maybe twice a week there is a big difference. It's mostly noticeable on problems where I'm still fresh, and I know I should be easily able to hang and pull down on a hold but where my grip fails almost instantaneously.

Is there a way to assess CNS fatigue in climbing (somewhat) objectively? In weightlifting it's easy to see: if you were lifting X weight a week ago but are struggling even with your "easy" weights, then you're probably fatigued. In climbing this is harder to assess.  

So what I want to ask regarding this: Have you ever felt a CNS fatigue whilst climbing and how did you notice and remedy it. Rest is a given, but how much, anything additional (besides good nutrition) to add? 

I'm slowly trying to get out of my "just winging it" sessions and actually want understand how to plan efficient training sessions that will not only be fun, but also progress my climbing and preserve my body a bit better than I'm doing now. There's a lot to read up on when it comes to weightlifting and the human body (best approach for endurance, strength, rest times during and after workout, nutrition etc.) The "just climb" advice has worked well for this first year, however I want to actually start structuring my sessions to be more productive and would love some help.


Edit: Wow, there's a lot of of good stuff here. Don't worry, I've read it all but haven't had the time to respond yet. Thank you all for your input. I'll try to reply tomorrow :)
Pro climber skill class shares One training tool I've found super useful is the expert climber clinics the Touchstone gyms run in the Bay Area. They snag visitors or locals to teach a session or a multi-session clinic for fairly cheap; I've done two so far (Alan Moore in September for a 4-week series and Carlo Traversi for a one-off advanced movement class in December), and am starting a 3-week clinic by Beth Rodden on Thursday. My girlfriend is taking a class from Alex Puccio in ~2 weeks. Would anyone be interested in reading cliffs notes from the Rodden or Puccio clinics? Have any of you taken high-level skills classes that taught you particularly useful or nonintuitive gems? Carlo had us do a drill he called the "wave of motion" to get fluid transitions between holds, in which we worked on leading from the feet up the body to the hands on every move - it was *incredibly* counterintuitive at the time but I feel like I keep understanding additional pieces of it as I figure out more movement on my own.
What single stretch has given you the most bang for the buck? I'm trying to piece together a flexibility routine I can do at home on my rest days. So I'm curious, what single stretch have YOU done that has improved your climbing performance the most and why?

I did a quick search on the sub and nothing good really came up, it seems like everyone is more concerned with rehab, finger strength, overall strength and whether to arc, limit boulder, do 4x4s or what not.

Hit me with your Best stretch. Cheers.
Everybody. Relax. Steps onto soap box: If you've never trained before or even if you've trained for a few years, it doesn't matter what you do. Linear/non-linear/undulating/etc. It will all work. If you've essentially done nothing, just doing something is going to make you better. Your individual experience doesn't necessarily reflect the actual efficacy of whatever training program you're doing. You are merely a data point. How trained you are, your exercise background, how well you stuck to the program, your diet, your stress level, your sleep. All of these things influence the results of your "training". What works for you may or may not apply to others that you perceive to be similar to you. 

Don't get caught up in the minutia of sets/reps/volume/periodization/etc. focus on the general principles. Be consistent. Don't jump on every new workout you see on Instagram. The reality is: you are not a professional athlete. You don't get to eat, sleep, and drink your training. You will always have to compromise. The amount of return you will see from trying to implement the training protocols at the extreme end of the spectrum are essentially nonexistent. You will get far more out of the simple things. Climb hard some days. Climb easy other days. Focus on your technique. Train basic body movements a couple times a week. Stretch. Hangboard every so often. Rest when you're tired. 

Stop trying to force yourself to climb V10 in 6 months. 

It takes years and years to learn how to climb well. 

"I've been climbing for 3 weeks, how do I get better?" Climb damnit!

"I've been climbing V6 for 3 months, how do I break my plateau?" 3 months!? Are you kidding me!? That's not a plateau! Welcome to climbing! Talk to me when you've not climbed a higher grade in 5 yrs and then we'll talk about plateaus. 

Stop rushing it!
Everybody relax! Hahaha!

😁
Beth Rodden footwork class notes I attended a 2-hr footwork class with Beth Rodden at my local gym last night. The first ~third focused on broadening the set of foot placements we could push from - initially through forcing us to iteratively work on front/back steps with our main driving foot, and then by forcing us to place and smear our other foot on the wall and keep it there throughout the following movement. I tend to drive off one foot and wave the other around like I'm directing aircraft for landing, so this was a good reminder to work on static placement.

For the remainder of class we partnered up and ran through elimination drills on toprope: (1) climbing with only smears for feet, (2) climbing with only smears for *hands,* (3) climbing with reinforced cardboard "boards" taped to the inside of our elbows to keep our arms straight, and (4) only letting one foot (left or right) use footholds and smearing the other. These were all useful to varying degrees. The foot eliminates made me think more than I usually do about placement and the boundaries of which foot placements do and don't work as a function of handhold quality. Forced straight arms resulted in some odd movement angles (I was trying it on an arete problem that "naturally" would've used locked-off elbows to position my torso for optimal feet) and, again, made me explore the boundaries of what can vs. can't work rather than sitting as comfortably in the middle of my movement range as possible. Forcing no-hands was by far the most interesting; we were working it on a slabby section with two walls about 160 degrees off from each other, so in sections without well-placed juggy holds I had to get very dynamic with foot placement. The big take-home is that I can't land dynamic feet for crap without the extra stability afforded by my arms; so, I'll likely keep working that for a while to see if I can get better at using/absorbing body momentum with my feet rather than just placing feet statically while hanging from my arms.

As a general movement note: Beth keeps her shoulders and hips almost perfectly square to each other, rotating or moving her entire torso as a solid unit. I've tended to allow some rotation between hips and shoulders to statically reach positions with one limb pair and then drag the other to the next position; Beth's movement was clearly more efficient. At some point soon, I'm going to try working a drill where I tape a rigid frame (probably cardboard again since it's safe-ish to drop) to my back and use that to force more unified hip/shoulder alignment.

I hear people express skepticism that pro classes are worth the time/money. This was ~$60 for a few tweaks to basic mechanics and drills to emphasize them, along with a couple of points of individual feedback when I wasn't getting the point of a drill. To me, that's more than worth the money; climbing is a structure built of basics, and who knows how long it would've taken me to identify and come up with a progression path for the foot placement issues I clearly have on my own.

Thanks for reading, and I'll post again in a week for the next class (using slopers &amp; crimps more optimally).
Steroid use at top levels of climbing? Hey guys just something I've always been curious about. It's no secret that top level athletes of virtually every sport use some type of performing enhancing drug(s), and I was wondering if anybody has any insight into what that's like at the top levels of climbing. Thanks!
Repeating problems near your limit I was wondering how you guys approach repeating problems that were a struggle to send. My usual pattern when working on something that I find hard in a strength sense is:

1. Work it for a while trying to get technique down &amp; recruit strength required to sent it.
2. Complete problem and have the standard reaction of "that wasn't that hard".
3. Never repeat the problem again.

Now there are a few reasons I don't repeat hard stuff very often. There is usually other hard stuff still to do. I don't have amazing stamina so I don't want to waste it on repeats. Most problems in a gym just aren't that good. 

I've been thinking lately that this is probably something I should do more of really. Try and get these hard problems optimised and practise technique on stuff that is near my limit instead of stuff that I can easily do.

Its quite hard to know sometimes when you are being technical sound on a an easy route as you always have that strength there to tap into. You think you are doing the rockover well but if you aren't, your strength just kicks in and you use your arms to make up for the shortfall in technique.

So, how many of the better climbers in here repeat hard problems that they have already sent and do you think its beneficial.
Beth Rodden class 2: heel hooks, slopers, flags Tonight was session 2 of 3 of the Beth Rodden technique class at Berkeley Ironworks. This time we covered flagging, heel hooks, slopers, and crimps. Overall structure was similar to the first class (first demos, then working drills on the wall), but with a couple of drills in the first half where the 8 of is iteratively tried something and Beth offered feedback and pointers. It’s a good structure for group classes; you [the teacher] can ensure everyone identifies problems to work on before the freer-form drills, and you get a sense of whom to watch for what movement issues later.
FLAGGING: Beth uses flagging mostly to prevent barn doors on a single foot placement while reaching for the next handhold. Flags can be inside (crossing over the front of the placed foot) or outside (passing over the back). Interestingly, she uses inside flags mostly for vertical/slab work - as it brings the hips in tighter to the wall and can therefore offer a bit more reach - and outside flags mostly for steep terrain, where it lets you keep your arms straighter. There’s a bunch of interesting core rotation work going on here that I hadn’t thought about before - I almost always flag outside, so I need to work on inside flags but also thinking about how to best use the changes in position the outside flag creates.
HEEL HOOKS: Beth characterizes heel hooks by point of contact. The back of the heel is mostly for generating movement; point the toes up to push your hips up vertically, point them away from you to generate side pull. She also uses the outside of the heel on steep terrain to pull the hips in towards the wall, generating position rather than movement per se. She’s such a fan of heel hooks that she recommends *always* getting a heel hook rather than a toe placement if you’ve got a good hold for it, since the power generated is so much better; I need to work on that. Other points to work on include placement precision, in that my toes are way more accurate right now, and remembering to use them on static rather than dynamic movements.
SLOPERS: None of this was rocket surgery, but she did make us actually engage all five fingers into big slopers and *apparently* I’m just totally crap at using my thumbs. Maybe you are too, Dear Reader. Find microholds when you can, climb around rather than over the sloper, generate side pressure or squeeze with both hands if you have to ascend past one while holding it.
CRIMPS: This was mostly a training warning. Beth does min edge / bad hold training, and recommended the fairly standard protocol of picking something you can hold for 13s and doing 10s on / 3mins off reps for however many sets are appropriate. She doesn't generally train with added weight because she thinks it's too much of an injury risk. I think I was the only person in the class who does hangboard/no-hang training. One gem from this was that Beth’s definition of half crimp has the distal finger joint (DIP) fully or even hyperextended, just not with the thumb locking the fingers down and a ~90-degree PIP angle. I’d been trying to keep both at ~120 degrees (which is much weaker), so I may switch up my no-hang routine a bit.

We did about an hour of drills:
* beth set a weird, traverse-y boulder problem with some steep but decent slopers to make us use them like we’d gone over. To finish without deadpointing, you had to hang off one with your left hand, heel hook and pull hard with your right foot to raise your center of mass to nearly left hand level, and reach up and left with your right hand with your torso nearly sideways - good way to integrate heels and sloper use.
* we had a slab traverse of maybe a dozen slopers in a row with decent feet. Nothing too challenging if you’d used slopers before, but it was interesting to note how the smaller people used dynamic movement; I’ll go back and see if I can work some more dynamic movement on bigger sloper-to-sloper pairs.
* we taped our thumbs to our hands and climbed something a letter or two down from our level - I tried a 5.11c with big moves between protruding cylinder bundle holds, which is a cakewalk if you can grab them but basically turns into a series of oddly placed slopers otherwise. Again, good for integrating sloper technique.

Nothing was as revelatory as the shoulder/hip frame stuff last week, but the heel hook and to a lesser degree the flagging refinements are going to be worth the price of admission and then some. Thanks for reading.
Alex Puccio &amp; Nina Williams clinic notes I took an Alex Puccio + Nina Williams clinic today. It was focused on technique for beginner/intermediate and dynos.

From Puccio, when you climb you want to maximize efficiency and to do that you want to use your hips to create the momentum for movement. First you stick your feet and don't move it after you have found a good foot hold. It will minimize slippage if you don't hop around on it. 

Then keep your arms straight and basically get down into a squat. Really open up your hips, Asian squat style. Swing using your hips to lead the movement and use your legs to drive power into the swing. You want to minimize using your arms pulling you to the next hold and maximize the momentum from the swing to get you up. 

Think of your body like a pendulum.

Heel hook:
Do not position your foot so that your knee is pointed out. Place it in a position where you can put the side of your foot against the wall and your knee closer to the wall. Be thoughtful about where you place your heel because you want to place your heel a little higher than the spot you are aiming for. You want to be able to roll your heel into position to get that power.  

Sometimes the situation will call for a toe hook instead of a heel hook. With a toe hook, you can get that extra reach needed even if the heel hook feels initially better. Another advantage that a toe hook has is that the swing will be less when you cut it.

Dyno:
From Nina Williams, she said that the trick is to coordinate your arms and legs to work together. Aim w/ your hands and eyes. Your legs will be the driving force and use your hips to stay close to the wall. 

Postion your feet and start low. Get down into the straight arms and squat postion. Image your legs being a frog legs.

Look and focus on the hold you are aiming for. Hips go up first then pop w/ your legs but don't release you hands until the last minute. The lower your feet are, the harder the dyno will be so try to keep the feet position high. 

Stand and squat down for a pump. Your body should be going up, down and spring back up. Do not stop when you get to the squat, you are losing momentum. The pump and dyno should one fluid motion. Maybe pump once for a smallish dyno, maybe 2 for a bigger dyno or if you are tired. Any more is just a waste of energy. Remember to keep those hips into the wall. 

Side dyno, you may want to focus on gaining momentum w/ the swing using your hips. Look with your head, swing w/ the hips and legs to pop. Again your hands do not leave the hold until the very last moment. Try to grab the hold with both hands if it's big enough. That way it minimizes possible shoulder injuries. You do end up with a crap ton of power and you don't want to accidentally injure your shoulder.

If you are too scared to grab the hold, don't focus on grabbing it. Instead, just focus on the swing and movement. Once you feel comfortable there, just touch the hold. 

Quote from Puccio and Williams "Remember, if you can touch it, you can grab it." This is inspiring to me because I am 5'4" and dynos have always seems terrify. Today was the first time I have ever tried to dyno. I managed to get a good solid one today and almost got a side dyno. =)

Williams also stressed that practice is key. Do a few of them every time you climb and you will get better at them. Direct quote "Don't be afraid to make a fool of yourself. Thats really half the fun is like falling straight on your face cause then you have a really good story for later."

Question to users of The Gripster 2.0 Hi Folks, Mike here from The Gripster. One of my moulds recently ripped. I'm making new moulds from a slightly new master. I'm using a 3d printer now and I've tweaked the angle of each edge slightly. The angle of each edge is now different in relation to each other but the same relative to the point of attachment.  

My questions is, do you like the way the grip currently ends and the curved edge is smooth. Or would you prefer the grip to curve over the edge?

Heres the [current edge](http://imgur.com/a/DgQGh)

Beth Rodden class 3: dynos &amp; projects Last night was the last session (of 3) of the BIW Beth Rodden clinic. This time we spent ~30 minutes on dynamic movement, then trekked around the gym working our various projects and getting feedback.


**DYNOS** Every pro I’ve heard emphasizes different aspects of dynos when teaching, even if they’re doing more or less the same motion. Gems from Beth that I hadn’t heard/thought of previously were: 1) try and catch the target hold as you’re heading towards it and/or the wall, not away from them (to reduce load while catching). 2) If you’re dynoing towards a hold that’ll be hard to catch and may barn door you off the wall, consider pogoing instead for better rotational stability. 3) To work the basic mechanics of catching dynos, do routes on toprope while forcing double-hand movements - for me, I picked a couple of nice, juggy 5.9s and tried to see how far up I could pounce each move. It’s a useful drill I’ll come back to.


**PROJECTING** My pet project is a vertical 5.12c problem made of tiny rounded crimps and tinier pinches. I managed to make it about halfway up (maybe 20’) before getting shut down hard on a slopey, probably pinchable block that just wasn’t a good enough anchor for a balance transfer on bad footholds. The only feedback I got was “yeah, that looks pretty hard,” and “maybe you should try doing more endurance work on the hangboard - it looked like you were getting too pumped from the previous moves,” which is at least actionable. I’m not convinced that there’s no finicky magic beta which’ll get me past that spot, but it’s reassuring to have a pro known for handling tiny holds tell you that you’re doing it more or less okay.



**ENDING Q&amp;A** people asked Beth various questions as we were packing up. Memorable bits included:
If you’re falling because you’re pumped, work endurance; if you’re falling because you can’t do the move, work power; if you’re falling because you can’t hold the hold, work strength.
Beth climbs weekends, trains Tues/Thurs, and always tailors workouts to her projects rather than just chugging through general attribute cycles.
My elbow tendons - both upper and lower arm - were cranky after hammering through the dyno exercises, so I asked about her prehab preferences. Beth claims to do rotator cuff exercises with elastic bands religiously, and also specifically recommended the FlexBars that TheraBand makes for elbow tendons; I’ve ordered one and will report back if it’s amazing.

Let's talk feet Aren't feet so sexy?

Just kidding. 

So foot work. How does a person newish to climbing trainer footwork?

I'm still relatively new, one to two times a week at the gym for the last 3 months and I'm running into a wall with foot work and mainly SLIPPING.

Projecting a 5.10d and 5.11a where my fail points are slippage. I can't seem to ever keep my foot planted if the foot hold is sloping off to a side. Like standing on a side pull or volume or something.

Is there any way to practice better footwork, particularly to stop slipping off holds like they're made of ice?
Trimming the Fat: Thoughts on DXA Scan Results after 8 Weeks of Dieting [Scan results here] (http://imgur.com/a/XvCwC)

**TL;DR:** Dieting and leaning out has had a very noticeable impact on my climbing ability.  It's totally possible to get stronger (better hangboard numbers + harder campus board sequences) while losing weight (mostly fat).  I always just trained to get stronger, but eating well/leaning out along with training will be the new norm for me when preparing for trips.  

I was curious about how lean/fit I was, and got my first DXA scan in June this year.  Turns out I was not as lean as I thought, and decided to diet along with my strength/power cycle in anticipation for a summer climbing trip this August.   

A friend of mine that is a competitive powerlifter recommended carb cycling (2 days low carb, 1 day high carb, constant protein at 0.8-1g/lb of BW, restricted total calories everyday at about 80% of normal, cheat days on outdoor climbing days), so I just went with that.  It was my first time doing a structured diet, and it was very interesting to see how my body responded to structured nutritional intake.  

Some things I noticed while dieting and training (4 weeks finger strength, 4 weeks campusing):

* It was initially very hard to climb well on low carb days.  Max strength fluctuated as much as -20% on hangs and my power endurance went to absolute shit.  But after 10 or so days my body probably got used to it and everything was back to "normal."  I always did climb best on high-carb days or the day right after a high-carb day though.

* It's totally possible to build strength and power while losing weight!  I started at +50lbs/10sec on the BM2k rounded edges, and am finally at +67.5lbs/10sec.  In terms of bodyweight percentages, I went from hanging with +35% to +50% bodyweight.  The combined effect of losing weight and increasing finger strength has been HUGE--I went from taking multiple sessions to send V9s at my gym to 1-sessioning them, and also 1-sessioning a few V9s outdoors.  During my power phase, I also finally hit 1-4-7 on the large Wood Grips rungs (I have never been a powerful climber, and always relied on trickery or beta to do long pulls).  

* Of the 8lbs that I lost, 5.5lbs were fat, and 2.5lbs were muscle.  I dunno if that 66/33 split is good or not, but I'm glad most of it is fat.  The majority of that 2.5lbs is in my ass (gynoid) and legs, which makes sense--I don't do any lifting whatsoever, and the majority of stimulus from bouldering is focused in the upper body, where I did not lose much lean mass at all.  The biggest delta was in my abdominal region (android), which changed from 16% to 10.5%, and apparently is where the typical fat stores are for males.  Of the 5.5lbs of fat, 5lbs were from my chest/back (trunk) and legs.  

* I should probably bench/squat/deadlift a little to put on some lean mass after my trip.  My LMI is complete shit (bottom 5 percentile), so it can't hurt to bulk, then cut so to something like 140lbs with the same bodyfat percentage as now (15%).  Bulking hopefully shouldn't be hard, and cutting weight again won't be as hard the second time around anyways! 

* (an aside, not related to DXA or dieting) Hangboarding year-round is the real deal.  I used to lose finger strength when transitioning into my power phase, but have found that hangboarding once a week, along with campusing, helps to maintain and (albeit slowly) improve finger strength from my strength cycle.  Indoor climbing and even campusing on the small Wood Grips rungs does not seem to be enough stimulus for me.  

I can say that I'm definitely the most "in shape" for climbing that I've ever been, and will be excited to see how I climb on this trip.  I'd like to send a V10, or at least multiple V9s, so we'll see how it goes.  Even if I don't, I definitely learned a lot about how to eat well, and also how my climbing abilities are affected in the process of cutting weight.  

I hope this post inspires other climbers to consider eating well and to maybe trim some fat.  It's obvious that training will get us stronger, but like any other sport, getting lean (after all, we're only competing against gravity, so why pull dead weight?) is also a great way to improve our climbing ability.
Climbing Technique Resources I don't know if I am expecting too much or I am missing all the stuff that is out there but there seems to be a lack of good quality technique and movement resources about. There are millions of training articles, exercises etc but very little beyond the absolute basics when it comes to technique. 

I would love to see video series where coaches take climbers through difficult moves / problems and help them perfect the technique required to send / economise their movement. When I see a video on technique it is usually "this is a backstep, this is a rockover" and its on massive holds and aimed at beginners.  Either that or we are watching pro climbers go up hard climbs with no real pointers on what they are doing. 

I want to learn more about generating motion from my hips and getting weight through feet and this is the sort of thing that is quite body position dependent so seems like something that could be demonstrated well on video. 

I know there are the gresham masterclass videos but again, these are teaching a simple technique on favourable holds that doesn't necessarily help with things get hard. 

So are resources like this available or is this something that just isn't out there yet.
I can't one-arm-hang on a jug. How do I address this weakness? I've been climbing for 10 years, I climb V7/8 and 5.12b/c outdoors. About 6 months ago I realized I had a terrible habit of not engaging my shoulders while climbing. I've been working on this. However, my shoulders are still very weak compared to the rest of my body.

I've never really tried one arm hangs before, but this week I tried a one arm pull up and realized I can't even hang on, let alone pull up. I can't keep my shoulder together and engage, it just opens up. 

I've started doing negative weight one arm hangs to address this. What other exercises should I do to strength my shoulders?
How did weight loss impact your climbing? I'm curious to how much weight loss impacts climbing ability. 

How much weight did you lose? And what was the corresponding increase in your max grade?
Optimizing sleeping I think sleeping is a vastly underrated aspect of the recovery process and I would like to optimize my quality of sleep. 

I would love to hear your experiences.

How do you get the best quality of sleep?
Can't Stop Getting Finger Injuries Hey guys,
I've been climbing for five years now, and almost every year when I start to get up to climbing around the V7/hard 5.12 level my fingers get tweaky and/or injured. I've been working on very gradual hangboarding, putty, rice buckets, stretching, long warmups, but once I start bouldering or just climbing hard my fingers go to shit within weeks. What can I do, I'm going crazy.
tall people- faster climbing style i recently saw this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlB_4tOJqZ4&amp;t=295s&amp;index=1&amp;list=LLf2zF4s5rhDEjgEePVkP5ug
and was really impressed by the climbing style. very fast/fluid progression which is fantastic to watch and must be so fun. as the climber seems to be quite tall i was wondering if taller people would benefit from a faster paced climbing style. we are a bit disadvantaged by our strength/mass ratio so you would want to limit the amount of time you spend on a route. but our longer reach gives us more options and are suited for a dynamic style.  
dean potter also comes to mind as a tall climber who climbed at a high tempo. 
(this all keeping in mind that of course improving technique is the biggest priority)
what are your thoughts on this?
Thoughts after solely bouldering for 6 weeks. I won't use grades because my gym's grades are sandbagged AF.

Anyway, I did nothing but boulder indoors for the past 6 weeks (with about 1.5 weeks of vacation time in those 6 weeks).  Today was my first time on ropes... and wow.  I sent, on the first attempt, a route where I kept on falling at the crux time after time, right before starting the bouldering cycle.  Overall, I felt fucking great.

The bouldering weeks weren't overly structured... I either did circuits or worked on this one problem I wanted to send (which I ended up doing on the last 5 minutes of the last day).

My normal climbing consisted of top roping and bouldering, along with strength training.  During the bouldering-only weeks, I stayed away from the weights.  I beat my body up, and I'm happy I did.

Tl;dr:  bouldering cycles absolutely rock.  Looking forward to my next one!
[Meta] r/climbharder growth I tried posting a link to the traffic statistics page but apparently that's only view-able by moderators. The summary is that over the last year our monthly pageview count has risen by 66%, and our total number of unique user pageviews has risen by over 100%. Previous year's growth was similar. Our subscription rate has also grown commensurately. 

Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for participating helping to make this subreddit such a good community. We're proof that a self curating community can be both helpful and remain civil. We have seen some pretty extreme growth over the last year or two, and every month we've set new records for pageviews and unique visitors. Keep on asking insightful questions, posting interesting topics, and encourage others to visit. I know when I'm asked what the best training resource out there is I always tell people about this subreddit (yeah I'm biased).
Struggling to move from V5 to V6/7 Ok, so I know climbing isn't all about the grades, however, they do help me manage and track progress. I've been climbing on and off for yeaaaars now. Started off once a week very casually and only within the past year or so attempted to climb 2 or 3 times a week. I am consistently able to do most V5s and then the jump to V6 is just that bit too much. Actually, they feel impossible.
This isn't just in my local gym aswell, I try and mix it up. I can usally manage one or two in the v6 grade. I was wondering if I have to start some kind of training to get better. All I do is turn up and climb until I'm tired. 
Is there any training at home or outside the gym that would help?
I struggle with reach and slopers. I'm a girl and have pretty small hands and arm reach, so these kinda climbs are always difficult. Im not sure how to train them though?
I just want to get better 😣 
Thanks!
Going for my first full day of outdoor bouldering. How do I endure a day of climbing when I am used to 1 hour gym sessions? I just planned to go with a group from my climbing gym for a full day of climbing outdoors and I'm super excited! 

However, it is my first time ever climbing for such a long time. I'm still quite the beginner, as I'm used to go bouldering V4/6b routes in the gym where I usually burn out in an hour or two.

How do I handle the transition from an intensive session inside to a far longer session spent outside?
Progress! Thank you to everyone at r/ClimbHarder Super stoked and excited that I conquered my first 5.13- at the climbing gym yesterday! I was on cloud nine last night. Unreal. It was something I was hoping to reach in October but the Gods of Sendtember smiled on me and I completed it a month early. 

But this is not a bragging thread, I swear. What I really wanted to do was thank all of you for for helping make such a fantastic community centered around climbing improvement. When I started at r/climbharder I thought there was some perfect training plan that I could use to climb better, but was quickly put in my place with some of the [top threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/6n3dah/everybody_relax/) here - many of which I still look back and [read today](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/2xxcr7/why_you_arent_getting_stronger/) when I have an unmotivated day. I picked a plan, stuck to it and have seen fantastic progress. Reading [other people's climbing stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/3y2qb5/11a_to_12c_and_what_ive_learned_in_the_process/) and journey kept my excitement up and I knew that if I put in the time, discipline and kept climbing fun and interesting I would [get there eventually](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/6bgp8h/every_climber_can_get_to_v10_jon_glassberg/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=browse&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=climbharder). 

There are so many knowledgeable, great people in this community and don't want to leave anyone out so I'm not going to name any particular names - but thank you all for sharing your time, experience, ups &amp; downs, stories, questions, and training experiments. It has truly been a pleasure to read and I always look forward to seeing new comments and threads on this subreddit. 

My hype is high, the sky is the limit and I can't wait to see what's next. Thanks again everyone!
Flexibility training recommendations? Hey! So with the progress I've made for the past few months, I'm making good improvements with technique and especially strength. I was working on one of my projects the other day, and was a pretty technical problem. The crux required alot of flexibility too (for the current beta I'm using), which I lack and in turn I'm not close to being able to pull off the crux. I'm also struggling to do stuff like heel hooking a hold relatively vertical a bit above my stomach, etc 

My question is: what do you guys recommend I do to improve my flexibility? I have never done any flexibility training or yoga before so I'm open to anything!
What about non-training pre-climb warmups and post-climb stretching ? Hello everyone !  

I know most of you seem to be here for the muscular training ... and that's not exactly why I'm here today !

I've been bouledring for about 6 month, twice a week, and I'm starting to be concerned about my muscular health. Throughout my whole high-scool ( only sport I ever did ), teachers always payed attention to pre-sport warming and post sport stretching.

The thing is, I haven't found finite resources on basic warmups to do before climbing.  
My arms still get very firm quickly, for example.

 And I have the same struggle for post-climbing stretching. I'm not specially looking for flexibility, just to chill my muscles down and let them recover nicely.

Is there such an help somewhere ?

I'm so sorry if I missed the relevant resources.  
Thank you for your help !
[Meta] Can we the default sort of the weekly question threads be by new? It [seems possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/342y8k/reddit_change_new_comment_sorting_options/) for moderators to set the default comment sorting method on a per-thread level. It would make sense for the weekly simple questions threads to have a suggested sort by new (they do this over at /r/climbing for the weekly new climber threads)
Those of you who try to "have it all" (both Power and Endurance), how do you balance your training? My question is pretty open ended:

For those of you who climb at higher grades and try to be an "all around" climber -balancing hard powerful boulders with long endurance sport routes, how do you do it?

I'm in a spot where I'm just starting to love rope climbing, but see small setbacks in my bouldering whenever I dedicate a stretch to it. I'm hoping the answer isn't just "you have to choose a main", so looking for all insights here!
"The Box" This is a term I've seen casually tossed about, most recently in Nalle's latest hard FA.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQfPC4WZy4Q

I also saw a video a while back of Dave Graham explaining this concept(I think it was taken down!)  It seems like if you really understand it it's the most important thing for getting through tough sequences.  Is it also useful for saving energy? 

I'm sort of fuzzy on the concept but basically is it about keeping your hips in a small spatial area while going through sequences?  Keeping your hips in etc.

**Share your interpretations and nice explanations you have stumbled on!**

Survey for Creating a Finger Brace for Tendon Injuries Incurred while Climbing Hi Everyone! I’m a senior at Georgia Tech, and my senior design group is designing an adjustable finger brace tailored to finger tendon injuries incurred while climbing. The general idea would be to have a finger brace that is customizable for each step of recovery from immobilization of the area to fully returning to your sport.  In order to accomplish this, we need to collect what customers desire in a product like the one described above. If you could take 5-10 minutes and fill out the survey below, it would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

PSA: EDGE SIZE vs. ADDED WEIGHT **EDIT: To clarify some ambiguous terms...When I say "larger edge" I'm still referring to half-pad to 1-pad holds (15-22mm). When I say "smaller edge" I'm referring to holds less than a half-pad (12-5mm).**


I've been getting this question a lot recently and I've also seen it pop up here every couple of visits. This is just simple physics. Think about it.


The reason a smaller edge is more difficult to hold on to than a large edge is because of leverage. You know what a lever is (I hope).

A smaller edge makes your fingers a less efficient lever, which in turn directs more LOAD TO THE MUSCLES.

When you alter your bodyweight when hanging off an edge by adding weight/removing less weight, you are adding LOAD TO THE MUSCLES.

When you are looking to increase the intensity of a hang, It straight up DOES NOT MATTER whether you add weight/remove less weight or move to a smaller edge size. 

The only exception would be if you were using a significantly different grip position (open crimp vs. half crimp) to hold one edge compared to another edge. And if you're doing it right, you're already controlling for that anyway so it is a non-issue.

I'll say it again if you missed it: IT DOES NOT MATTER whether you add weight/remove less weight or move to a smaller edge size. 

LOAD IS LOAD.

It doesn't matter if it is coming from the kettlebell tied to your waist or the leverage on the edge.

*Do whatever is more comfortable or available to you. 

*Don't like hanging with 100+lbs. on your waist? Go to a smaller edge!

*Don't like tearing your skin up on a 6mm edge? Go to a bigger edge and add weight!

It isn't complicated, don't try to make it complicated.
Skin as a Limiting Factor Obviously it makes a difference. And it seems clear to me that the stronger the climber, the greater importance they put on their skin. People that climb v10 sleep with their hands in socks covered in climb-on. Climbers who send v12 spend their rest days staring at their fingertips, mumbling about a split tip. And v15 crushers don't even wash their hands unless they're promised that they'll get introduced to their partner's intimate area soon after. 

My question is, how important is skin, and how can I improve my skin for climbing performance? I definitely find that good climbing days happen exactly when my skin feels thick and dry. 

Personally, I have very fat, bulbous fingertips, which I feel can make crimping certain holds difficult, and makes using seams nearly impossible sometimes. 

Particularly on very small holds, I have trouble figuring out if I'm not strong enough, or my skin isn't good enough to get enough friction. The small holds on hangboards (6mm or less) always feel *terrible* to me. I understand that that's the point, but I'm wondering if my skin is making it additionally hard. Like when I touch those types of holds, I practically feel like there's just a sliver of skin on them, and I'm unable to apply even close to enough force to hold the hold. If my skin is thick enough, occasionally I feel like I can hold onto microcrimps open handed if they're razorblade-like enough, and I can actually *hang* from the hold (scary feeling). 

For people who climber v-double digits, I'm wondering, if you can remember back to when you couldn't hang on very small holds and now (assuming you can now), do you think the sensation of not getting any purchase is due purely to not being strong enough?

Sorry if my questions are all over the place. It's kind of hard to put the feeling of holding onto small holds into words, but hopefully you all an understand where I'm coming from.
[Technique Analysis] Learning Open Hand Movement Concepts Hey r/climbharder!

In the spirit of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/6f19pd/technique_feedback_and_video_analysis_of_my_first/) from u/justinmarsan, I thought it would be nice to share my experience from a slightly different perspective and a narrower scope. There's more focus on each movement.

Apologies in advance for portrait mode, and for the somewhat brutal music my gym plays.

**Goals:**

As stated in the title, I wanted to practice and ingrain movement patterns that appear when using open handed holds. In my experience, these greatly differ from movement seen on half crimp holds, with a greater emphasis placed on flexibility, lower center of gravity, "smoothness", balance, and foot trust.

To this end, I aimed to climb everything as open handed as possible while staying safe. This meant that the climbs I was on were far below my limit in terms of difficulty.

I counted each hand move as a separate move.

**Video 1 -- V3-V5 Chill Crimp Route:**

**[Move 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES1htYh5NkI?t=0s):**

[This photo](http://prntscr.com/gpd8jc) illustrates the move well. My idea was to create opposition through my feet and roll through my shoulder to minimize elbow flexion. I couldn't eliminate elbow flexion completely; to do so would be to take too much weight off the left foot, because the right foot can only flag so hard. I would have had a straight arm if the left foot were directly underneath the right hand.

**[Move 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES1htYh5NkI?t=1s):**

[This photo](http://prntscr.com/gpdanp) illustrates the move well. In order to move into the high step, I had to pivot with my left foot, allowing my hips to open up. Once I was open enough, I transferred weight onto the high step by initializing my upwards movement and drawing my hips in close to the wall. Note that I had to first rotate *inwards* with my right hip to screw my right foot into the and free my right hand.

**[Move 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES1htYh5NkI?t=4s):**

A rather basic front step. Because I was on a right gaston, I wanted to open up through my left side and roll through the left shoulder. To do this effectively, I needed to find the correct balance point; that's where the flagging foot made its presence felt. The foot switch was handled in such a way that my weight was always taken by my feet; this was signaled by keeping my weight low and feet high. My arms were fairly straight throughout the move, though my scapulae were a little more elevated than they should have been. My hips could have been slightly closer to the wall.

**[Move 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES1htYh5NkI?t=5s):**

My first real misstep was during the start of this move. I kept my body elevated during the foot switch; this loaded my arms more than it should have. Were this a limit boulder, I would have just screwed myself. I believe this happened because I didn't feel comfortable on the left hand; there's only space for 3 fingers to fit comfortably and as such I didn't trust myself to straighten the arm.

The prevalence of rolling through the shoulder on overhangs (this wall angle is 20°) is clear throughout this route. I was happy with my hip rotation as I reached for the right gaston.

**[Move 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES1htYh5NkI?t=8s):**

I was very happy with the quick foot pivot at the start of this move to match feet. I stayed as low as I could in a rather extended position and kept low for the high step as well, when it was very tempting to pull high into the gaston. There should have been a little more hip initiation of the reach up to the high left hand, but I'm glad that I at least used *some*. I liked what I did with my upper body rotation once I reached the left hand; it allowed me to straighten the left arm and stay in balance with weight on the feet.

**[Move 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES1htYh5NkI?t=12s):**

I could have stayed a bit lower for the transition into the backstep. I didn't, because of the angle of the foot hold. I needed to get on top of it, and my flexibility didn't allow for me to place the backstep correctly *and* stay low. There was still a deep mistrust of the backstep as I reached for the end hold, which showed in the form of lots of shoulder engagement throughout the move.

**[Move 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES1htYh5NkI?t=15s):**

I probably should have done a left backstep to prevent relying on my shoulder strength. Once again, I didn't fully trust my left foot when I should have.

**Summary:**

Overall I was happy with how the climb went, but I also was given undeniable proof that my mistrust of my weaknesses (open hand and weighting potentially dicey feet) is preventing me from applying more efficient movement whenever weaknesses are presented to me, which is ironically when I need to be at my best.

I'm taking this as a sign that I should continue to practice becoming comfortable with my weaknesses on easy problems.

**Video 2 -- V2-V4 Open Handed Practice -- Take 1:**

This and the next video are the same climb. The second video was done after some consultation with my technique and open hand guru, Evan. Climb with people who excel in your anti-style, folks.

**[Move 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk6haiIAjhk?t=1s):**

The body position is there, but it looks forced because it *is* forced. I wasn't relaxing into the feet at all; I was tensing heavily through my right arm because I didn't trust my feet to handle a reduction of grip, nor the hand relying on being truly open.

**[Move 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk6haiIAjhk?t=3s):**

The weight shift looked nice, but again I was super tense through my right arm, and then through the left arm during the cross. There's no sensation of weightlessness.

**[Move 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk6haiIAjhk?t=8s):**

When I rocked over, I put a lot of the weight on the right shoulder instead of the left foot to take weight off the right foot. Again, this is due to a lack of trust for the right hand to keep its grip if I relax it.

**[Move 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk6haiIAjhk?t=9s):**

Maybe the only move I was happy with. I caught myself bringing my weight up too high when drawing the left foot up and adjusted on the fly. It would have been better to just stay low the entire time, though. I did manage to trust the left foot when matching the large hold.

**[Move 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk6haiIAjhk?t=12s):**

I liked the flip of the right hand, but my approach to the left hand was even worse than moving linearly; I my arc was inverse to how I wanted it to be. (I went up and over instead of over and up.) This lack of linearity meant that although my backstep and hip rotation looked nice, they were not really doing anything because my shoulder was taking most of my weight.

**[Move 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk6haiIAjhk?t=14s):**

Once again, I had the right idea with the heel hook, and on the surface it looks fine. On closer inspection, however, revealed the forced nature of the heel. My left arm was cranked on the left hand, and my right hand was pressing hard down into the large hold. My body was pulled too far to the left to make the heel hook smooth and efficient, and it also impacted my approach angle.

**[Move 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk6haiIAjhk?t=19s):**

Straightening the right leg looked nice, but was fairly useless. I should have just pivoted my left foot instead and kept the heel engaged partially. I did roll through the shoulder nicely for the match, though.

**Summary:**

This attempt was pretty much the definition of forced technique, where on the surface everything looks correct, but in reality all that's happening is that I'm weighting my shoulders with my body in some position that doesn't really matter. I was not relaxed enough on any of the holds, nor did I move non-linearly to anything.

**Video 3 -- V2-V4 Open Handed Practice -- Take 2:**

**[Move 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_KRZiDlKBU?t=0s):**

I was still not as relaxed as I should have been, but this was an improvement. I simply moved to slow to have made the move smooth, but I succeeded in weighting the feet more. Note that I rotated the hips as I did the move this time, instead of putting myself in a position then using my shoulders to anchor myself said position.

**[Move 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_KRZiDlKBU?t=2s):**

I had a smoother transition onto the large hold this time. I relaxed my left hand as I crossed, and simply leaned over into the right hand. There was elbow flexion, but there was so little engagement through the arm that it wasn't taxing to do so.

**[Move 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_KRZiDlKBU?t=7s):**

I kinda, sorta, achieved that floating sensation! I trusted the left foot much more, to the point where my right foot just kind of dangled down as I leaned further to the left. I looked relaxed on the hand because I *was* relaxed on it. Big improvement over the previous attempt.

**[Move 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_KRZiDlKBU?t=8s):**

I skipped the little hold and went straight to matching the larger one. I kind of bungled my foot beta for this move, but there was so little engagement through the arms that it wasn't tiring to relax and rethink my foot sequence.

I managed to move the left hand up with a slight arc from underneath. I avoided linearity, though not by much. I could use further refinement for this move archetype, as well as better body awareness. That's one of the problems with refining technique when you've got a large amount of strength to play with.

**[Move 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_KRZiDlKBU?t=16s):**

There was a massive difference between this hand heel match and the previous one. [A picture](https://prnt.sc/gpclty) really highlights the difference between Take 1 (left) and Take 2 (right). The video does a great job at showing the results of such a difference.

I kept my left foot lower on the foothold, which meant that I trusted it more than last attempt. I straightened my left arm almost fully, as opposed to maintaining around 90° of elbow flexion. This meant I was able to rely on flexibility to bring my right heel onto the hold and crank in, because I wasn't stuck pulled over to the left.

All of this led to me being able to weight the heel hook a **lot** more than the first attempt, and let me take a non-linear approach to the end hold. My heel completely replaced my right and left hand, which meant that my left hand was doing what it was supposed to be doing all along -- keeping me leaned into the wall. (Which is vertical.)

**[Move 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_KRZiDlKBU?t=23s):**

I was able to keep weight on the heel for the match, coupled with a slight left foot pivot. This resulted in a casual match with most of my weight on my feet instead of the right hand.

**Summary:**

I'm super happy with how this went. I was able to get a good grasp on what my weaknesses are, how they present themselves, and how they're limiting me on hard problems. I also know how to address those weaknesses, and that i'm able to do so through deliberate practice on the wall.

As a sidenote, my open hand strength was exhausted after around 90 minutes of this, and I didn't really try anything super difficult. It's probably the most open handed climbing I've done in one session, though. This leads me to believe that I should be able to greatly improve open hand strength with a fairly low intensity for training, which in turn implies that I'm not at some sort of plateau for it. I can't see why this wouldn't apply to half crimp for those in the opposite boat as me, as well.

PSA: Stay the hell off the campus board I know, I know, everyone has heard that you shouldn't be on the campus board until you've been climbing for several years and you consistently climb (insert grade harder than you climb) but you have reason to believe that you're the exception to the rule. You're not. Stay off it, you don't need it.

Remember the circumstances under which the campus board was invented? The man who did the worlds first 13d, 14a, and 14b, was training for a powerful 12 meter pocket route with massive pulls between one and two finger pockets and generally no feet. He invented the campus board to train for that route, which became Action Directe, the world's first 14d.

If Wolfgang Gullich could climb 14b without ever using a campus board you certainly don't need it to send your V6 project in the gym. There are better ways to improve your climbing, and not injure yourself.

TL;DR - Stay off the campus board until you're 100% positive that this post doesn't apply to you. If you're not sure if it applies, then it applies.
Hey /r/climbharder we're releasing a very rough version of our mobile app today! Hey y'all. Back in March I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/62ghp7/a_fitness_tracker_for_indoor_climbing_that/) about a fitness tracker specifically designed for climbers that my buddy Brandon and I have been working on. The goal is to create a wristband that automatically tracks and logs each climb that you attempt, send or flash in the gym and so far we've had some [great success](http://www.climbalytics.com/update/a-peek-behind-the-scenes-with-the-gamma) with our initial prototypes. Since then we've made a ton of progress, which we [summarize each month](http://www.climbalytics.com/updates).

I wanted to let you know that this month we released a very rough version of our mobile app and would love your feedback. This version of the mobile app just let's you manually log climbs, while we finish up our next hardware prototype (which will log everything automatically). We wanted to get something out there quickly and gather as much feedback as we can. I'm especially interested if you currently log your climbs with another app, and if there's anything that frustrates you that you think could be done better. I'll be adding new features to the app in October, so I'd love to know what's on your wish list!

Repeaters and max hang analysis for strength and hypertrophy (ft. Power Company Podcast and Steve Maisch) The [Power Company Podcast with Steve Maisch](http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/2017/9/21/episode-58-comparing-hangboard-protocols-with-steve-maisch) came out a week or so ago, and I wanted to write up something on it. 

Overall, this was a solid summary from /u/nauticaljack

&gt;Episode was a discussion with Steve Maisch about different hangboard protocols.

&gt; Steve floated an interesting idea about frequent plateauing w/ the Eva Lopez max hang protocol. He speculates that a 10" max hang is more targeted at recruitment whereas low total set repeaters are more beneficial for strength building. We know that repeaters are better for hypertrophy, so that seems to make sense.

&gt; That said, I'm curious how common this max hang plateauing is -- I've still been seeing improvement with max hangs cycle over cycle (which implies more than just temporary recruitment gains), but I still might be benefitting from some n00b gains.

To be honest, I hadn't given much thought to analyzing them via scientific principles beyond the isometric comparisons (in OG2 I generally . So here we go!

--------------------

**General scientific information**

We do know that *some* muscles have [greater proportion slow twitch fibers](https://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/hypertrophy/muscle-fiber-type/) than others. Typically, ones like soleus and forearm muscles do while bigger, two-joint muscles might have slightly greater proportions of fast twitch. We do not know, however, if it makes any appreciable difference or not in terms of the way we should apply training. The most relevant evidence so far indicates [probably not](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/muscle-fiber-type/) but perhaps not enough information yet.

Therefore, to default back to what we know about strength and hypertrophy:

* Strength = neurological adaptations * Muscle cross sectional area (hypertrophy). Generally, to maximize strength you want to train both strength and hypertrophy. It's no surprise that most of the strongest climbers have high levels of strength (can one arm half crimp bodyweight + additional weight) and have massive forearm hypertrophy.
* One factor in maximizing strength is recruitment which is predicated generally working toward 1 RM, with maximal recruitment occurring around ~3-5 RM. 
* Hypertrophy is maximized by working in all repetitions ranges. The three mechanisms are (1) mechanical tension, usually in low repetition ranges and high intensities; (2) Damage induced satellite cell donation, through sufficient intensity ~70-90% with higher volumes which usually is about the 5-15ish rep range; (3) Metabolic Stress, which is done through working with high repetition ranges and/or drop sets and super sets type work.

Some [more on hypertrophy here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5d5ecj/i_made_a_chart_detailing_the_current_research_on/) anywhere up to 100+ repetitions and [about any repetition ranges with high quality work](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/).

All of these present a solid framework to analyze hangboard protocols.

--------------------

**Hangboard protocols**

* Repeaters -- Most common type of repeater is probably the 3-5 sets of 6x(7 on/3 off) protocol, used for any number of different grips.
* Max hangs -- Most common form of max hangs is probably 3-5 sets of 7-10s holds, used for any number of different grips

If there are any others that I missed that you also want analyzed in this post them in the comments.

Let's look at one type of grip like say half crimp. The volume of work on the forearms is as follows:

* Repeaters -- 3-5 sets of 6 clusters of 7s on. 3*6*7 and 3*6*7 = 126-210s of volume on the forearms. Each set of 'repeater' generates 6*7 or 42s of total time under tension in a minute. 
* Max hangs -- 3-5 sets of 7-10s holds. 3*7 and 5*10 = 21-50s of volume on the forearms. 

How does it change if we use say 3 different grips for 3 sets (and no 5 sets)?

* Repeaters -- 3 different grips of 3 sets of 6(7on/3off). 3*3*6*7 = 378s of volume on the forearms. 
* Max hangs -- 3 different grips of 3 sets of 7-10s holds. 3*3*7 and 3*3*10 = 63-90s of volume on the forearms. 

Now generally, repeaters traditionally are not done with 3 different exercises (from what I am aware), so that can be taken with a grain of salt. However, someone training for increasing strength in their forearms with max hangs will often do anywhere from about 2-5 different types of hangs. 

--------------------

**General Analysis**

Generally, the standard conversion ratio I've used for isometric holds to concentric exercises is about 2s isometric = 1 repetition in practice (and in Overcoming Gravity 2). For example, someone could crank out 1 pushup in under a second, but the tougher an exercise is the longer it will take especially when you fatigue throughout a set. I think it's fair to say that 10 dips or 10 pullups would take about 20s or so for most people although some people can do it faster. It's also worth noting that hypertrophy has also been correlated to not just volume but time under tension. Steve also mentions that that 7s is recruitment which would make some sense in that ~7s is a 3-4 RM type of hold if done with maximal weight.

**Repeaters volume range**

* 3 sets of 6x(7 on/3 off) is 126s or ~ 63 reps
* 5 sets of 6x(7 on/3 off) is 210s or ~ 105 reps
* 9 sets of 6x(7 on/3 off) is 378s or ~ 189 reps

**Max hang volume range**

* 3 sets of 7-10s hangs is 21-30s volume or ~ 10-15 reps
* 5 sets of 7-10s hangs is 35-50s volume or ~ 18-25 reps
* 9 sets of 7-10s hangs is 63-90s volume or ~ 32-45 reps

Looking at this I have a couple of observations for the "time under tension" or "rep range":

1. In general, it seems to be that the volume for max hangs is generally insufficient to generate good amounts of muscular hypertrophy even though it definitely challenges recruitment substantially like most strength work. No one would go to the gym and just do 5 sets of an exercise for 5 reps each totally 25 reps. Although 5x5 does work for squats, usually most programs have more volume to maximize both strength and hypertrophy after beginner phases. 
2. The repeaters volume looks similar to what you would see is effective for most hypertrophy repetition ranges volume.
3. The amount of meaningful hard climbing you do in a session definitely has some measurable impact on how a hangboard session turns out (before or after) the the volume needed for a strength or hypertrophy stimulus.

There are definitely people who have progressively improved with max hangs, but I would speculate that is because they also paired that work with hard(er) climbing sessions to generate sufficient stress onto the muscles to create both a strength and hypertrophy response.

On the other hand, those who do repeaters may not necessarily need extra stimulus from a climbing day to generate sufficient stress to force hypertrophy adaptations. The lower loads definitely do preferentially cause maximal neurological adaptations, but there likely some good strength gain from the hypertrophy and some of the neurological adaptations that it does force.

Now, the "hard" part about training with isometrics and lower hold times -- or if you were lifting and were using lower reps and heavier weights -- is that you generally have to massively increase the number of sets you do to get anywhere close to the needed volume for hypertrophy. This seems to the case here with max hangs. However, we are just looking at max hang versus repeater protocol in isolation. Indeed, you could generally modify both of these protocols to where you could have more rest between sets with longer hold times and potentially generate sufficient volume to force strength and hypertrophy adaptation. For example, one could break up repeaters such as 6 sets of 3x(7on/3off) which would be similar volume to 3 sets of 6x(7 on/3 off) to minimize the amount of metabolic stress and focus on increasing the weight instead.

There's other factors you can look at such some type of concurrent periodization or conjugate periodization where you aim to maintain certain attributes and work on others at different times. This can apply for the strength equation where you may preferentially want to increase hypertrophy or neurological adaptations at particular times. This could be a topic for another post though. 

--------------------

**Conclusions** 

This post is way too long. I didn't expect it to be this long so congrats if you made it here.

* Overall, by volume repeaters in the 3-5 set range are superior for both strength and hypertrophy compared to max hangs up to 9 sets in isolation. However, this may be offset depending on the amount of hard(er) climbing that one does.
* In general, there are some people who never hangboard and still improve. This is probably due to innate or learned autoregulatory function where they climb hard enough to force enough muscular and strength adaptations without leading to overuse injuries without specific training. Chris Sharma is probably the foremost example of this + being a genetic freak.
* Both the hard day climbing volume and the hangboard protocol volume should be taken into account when using a hangboard protocol in order to make sure you are getting solid gains in strength and hypertrophy.
* Speculatively, there may be some merit to altering protocols to achieve some sort of hybrid. For example, one could break up repeaters such as 6 sets of 3x(7on/3off) which would be similar volume to 3 sets of 6x(7 on/3 off) which would make it less metabolic but would be compensated by higher weights being able to be used. Time is always a factor though as not everyone has it.

To round things back out with the PCP and Steve Masich. I agree with Steve Maisch that max hangs seem to be better for strength recruitment (neurological adaptations) but not hypertrophy and not necessarily overall strength. Repeaters seem to be superior to max hangs for overall strength and hypertrophy when comparing those protocols in isolation.
Effective Power Training on the Campus Board — Example Hello r/climbharder!

After the recent post from u/straightCrimpin that sparked a lot of debate, I wanted to show a real-world example of what happens when a double digit boulderer who is known for being powerful (myself) in the gym and outside hits up the campus board.

[Here's the video I'll be referencing](https://youtu.be/Q1oBcc1xlyg).

The video description gives all the pertinent information numbers-wise, so I'll cover everything else here.

The first thing to notice is that my reps slowed down significantly when comparing the first rep and the last reps, but the movement between rungs **did not** slow down. This implies that power was *not* my limiter — which renders this whole set ineffective.

I was working my anaerobic capacity of my fingers instead, because the rung size was **too small** for the distance I was traveling on each move. Keep in mind that these rungs are an edge I can comfortably one arm hang off of, and finger strength is something I don't lack.

I could modify a couple things: namely, rung size, or move distance. I would actually want to increase either of those, but preferably both for best results.

I would increase rung size by 5mm and do 1-4-7-10 for me.

There was also far too many total moves to effectively work power. Total TUT was 27 seconds, after subtracting time between reps. The pace was good, but the intensity was not correct.

**Conclusions:**

Don't work power on a campus board unless you can comfortably one arm hang off the edge for 10 seconds or more.

Keep the TUT low, which implies low rep count.

Make sure you're actually being challenged power-wise, and not strength-wise. You should be bottle-necked by power and nothing else.

From these anecdotal results, it's clear to see that you'd want to be bouldering at or near double digits to effectively train power on a campus board.

**Edit: To clarify, the purpose of this wasn't to show an optimal power exercise on the campus board. The purpose was to see an example of where things can go wrong when trying to train power on the campus board, and to demonstrate how easily you can be bottle-necked by finger strength when using campus rungs, especially given the prevalence of small rungs in many gyms.**
Is strength related training always the answer? I've noticed a pretty big trend on American climbing training that has been geared towards raw strength. Often times at the gym/crag I've noticed people after failing something just conclude "I cant do this climb. I'm not strong enough." It's sad to see them come to this conclusion. Maybe you just lack the technical prowess, poor beta, or you're unfamiliar with the rock type. As I've made the attempt to crack into harder grades, I've noticed that climbing hard is more about actually putting time into projecting, body awareness, and my mental state. Is climbing 5.12 sport hard? Well if we are being honest, no. Now to be fair I look up to climbers with some freaky natural talents (Dave Graham, Jimmy Webb, Joe Kinder, Adam Ondra, etc). Now I don't think I'll ever be a pro level climber, but is it really so foolish to think that most of us are capable of climbing 5.13/v8 just through climbing? Before you decide that entering a world of wooden rungs, and shaven down 2x4s with various edge sizes really ask yourself if you're weak or you don't understand how to climb well.
Improving hand jam strength and endurance for J-Tree in January Hey all!

I've recently been getting more into crack climbing and find that while I absolutely love it, my jams just aren't quite Bob Marley-level yet. I've been invited to spend most of January in J-Tree trad &amp; crack climbing and was hoping that the r/climbharder community would be able to point me to some resources to improve my hand jam technique, strength, and endurance so that I don't burn out on my first multi-pitch crack of 2018. 

My local gym is supposed to have a crack somewhere on the wall, but no one has seen it used in ages, unfortunately. Additionally, the 'cracks' I have access to outside are more for placing gear in instead of actually being any good for proper crack climbing (the curse of limestone, I suppose), so simple milage on easy stuff won't really work as well as I would want it to. 

I felt that I was using similar muscles during my hand jams as I would on a medium-sized pinch, so I was thinking that if I focused on various sizes of pinches and actively looked for any and all jams in the cracks here, I would be able to improve enough to get to a point wherein I wouldn't hold group back in J-Tree. Thanks for any and all feedback, I really appreciate it!

P.S. - I will be googling more technique and training articles/videos/sources, but I just want to be able to get a head-start as soon as I can to make the most amount of improvement as I can in the little time that I have. Thanks again!
V12+ Climbers of r/climbharder - What are you doing that most V10 climbers are not? What are ways in which you have refined your training regime the average V10 climber hasn't?  Or is there something unrelated to training?  Are you just more genetically gifted?

For the sake of this question, lets assume your *average* V10 climber is someone who has been climbing for a decent number of years (more than 3 or 4), is highly motivated, and has some sort of consistent training regime that leverages commonly known principles and target areas (endurance(aerobic), power-endurance(anaerobic), lots of max strength).  I would also be interested to hear if people don't think this is an accurate characterization....
Rock Climber's Training Manual Strength Phase I am really trying to follow the Rock Climbers Training Manual training ideas and building my seasonal workout. I have just completed two weeks of base fitness and have 1 more left. I need to start planning my strength phase. I have this plan to work toward my first 13a, but really I am more focused on overall improvement, not just for my goal route. 
 
 
Below is a link of my training plan (hangboard exercises are on the third tab). Weeks 4-7 are my focus in building out more and refine. My two asks are 
1) Do the hangboard workouts seem adequate or too much volume?
2) What supplemental strength training do you find best for lock-offs?

2nd round: Bouldering grade to max hang Hey,  


with all the benchmarking and testing going on around this subreddit I thought it would be time for a relaunch of my bouldering grade to max-hang web app.  


I posted some time ago and there are 370 climbers currently in the database. It gives you instant feedback on how your hang numbers compare to other climbers in the same grade range.  


**Directions**  


+ Click on the link: https://toclimb8a.shinyapps.io/maxtograde/  
+ Follow the instructions.  
+ Do NOT play around with fake data! This skews the results for everyone. 
+ You can't participate if you're not able to hang at least BW from an 18-20 mm edge for 10 seconds



Here are some graphs I made from the results last time:

[Discussion] The case against hangboarding - finding balance I know this is heresy with a clickbait title, but I couldn't think of a better title that conveyed the point. Some recent experiences in my own training spurred this post as it has been on my mind for a while. Hopefully, these ramblings can encourage better training habits and more accurate language per The Rock Warrior's Way. These are probably incomplete thoughts, but I hope to start a discussion on the subject.

Before going to deep into this, of course finger strength is important for success in climbing. There are certain amounts of finger strength and power required to send and it increases as the grade does, but I suspect there is an over emphasis on finger strength at the cost of being better climbers especially with those first gaining an interest in training. A focus on more balance is necessary. 

We often talk about how 'strong' a climber is envying their ability to hold onto and generate movement from small or hard holds and send difficult boulders. After an underwhelming base set of skills are developed, it seems more people are turning to finger and power training as the ideal solution to get better. After all, this is the easiest quantifiable way to track our climbing 'ability' or 'growth'. This is understandable, in large part climbing is a strength based sport and having concrete numbers to compare progress overtime is reassuring.

That said, why do we not envy the 'good' climber or the 'skilled' climber? Why the is 'strong' the primary vernacular? Recent metanalysis from Lattice training has shown that women are able to climb the same difficulty as men with a lower level of finger strength. Instead relying on better technique, flexibility and tactics. Check out [this link](https://www.trainingbeta.com/media/tom-ollie/) for more on analysis work. 

My own experience mimics this idea. I started hangboarding around the v4ish level. I constantly thought I wasn't strong enough to get better. Instead of looking at more nuanced areas of my climbing such as how I generate movement from my hips, I focused on the obvious solution strength. After my first cycle on the hangboard, I was quickly cusping the v6 relm. A few more cycles and I was making quick work of v7 and putting in time on harder problems. I saw results and didn't question the gains, after all I was getting better. Granted, most of this was in relative isolation. Eventually, I started meeting other climbers who were at similar or higher levels. Their finger strength numbers were often lower than mine, instead relying on other tactics to send. 

This spurred me to take a break from finger strength training for a few months, focusing on my weaknesses. Now, my fingers are weaker than they have been in ages, but I'm able to climb equally as well.

I've been thinking about this a lot lately and realized. Sure, all climbers that send hard are relatively strong, but that's not it. They are all GOOD climbers. No one brute forces there way up multiple 13+ routes or double digit boulders. It might happen occasionally, but not consistently. 

tldr; hangboarding is a great tool, but don't forget to train technique along side strength. Gains will be faster and you will be a 'great' climber, not just a 'strong' climber.
Female climbers &amp; finger strength Since it's come up in a couple threads recently, I think it'd be cool to have a discussion about *why* it might be that the recent Lattice study revealed that women generally have weaker fingers (controlling for body weight) for the grades they climb. There's the common trope that women naturally have better technique--probably partially because they come to the sport with less pulling strength. But it doesn't seem like that fully explains the discrepancy in finger strength. 

Also, how common are deviations from this "rule"? We all know a few women with lots of strength and not so much technique, and some men have a more "female" style.

Then, is the takeaway here that women should start hangboarding earlier, and stand to gain more from it? Or that men would generally be better off with more emphasis on hip flexibility and diversifying techniques?

Sorry this is so scattered! I'm really just curious about people's interpretations and reactions.
on-route resting/recovery and dangling fruit I just had a pretty interesting experience this weekend at the red and almost onsighted Banana Hammock at Miller Fork, which would have been my first 12, which seemed a little weird to me.  Stoke is particularly high since I don't really consider myself a good enduro climber and I've been making a lot of bouldering progress recently, but I felt super comfortable through most of the route.  One of the issues that I've been really working on that I think prevented me from the onsight was managing my heart rate and cooling down at the rests, particularly once I got to the 8/11th bolt.  I tried to rest on a set of OK holds and down a move to a pretty large ledge, was feeling pretty mentally exhausted, wasn't really feeling like I could recover, so I pushed on through, misread a pretty easy sequence, and peeled off.  I've started really working on engaging the rest of my body during rests, keeping hips in and really trying to use my feet, but I still felt like I should have been able to shake out on these holds and I couldn't calm down and read the sequence as effectively as I had for the lower sections.  I'm curious about a few things:  

Lame question, but If I did the rest of the route clean, after hanging for about 2 minutes, and found some ok rests later, and felt really comfortable, is this something I can come back and day-flash?

How do you know when you are rested and calm enough to keep going?

And what can you do to promote clarity when you are in a high stress situation like that, for the case where pump is manageable, but the issue is solely in panic/lack of focus, and where the issue is both being super pumped and freaking out?
List of not-so-obvious reasons your lower body mobility might be stagnating Having struggled with achieving my lower body mobility goals I've done some research over the last months and figured I'd share it

The likely cause of all these issues is excessive sitting with no proper compensation leading to improper movement patterns getting a whole nice downward spiral going resulting in an amalgamation of these things to varying degrees:

* **Insufficient internal/external rotation** 

	* Why: Weak core not contributing to stabilization of the hip is compensated by rotators being overly active
	* What to do: Side planks and front planks (tuck your tail!) or variations thereof [eg](https://youtu.be/UIDaXSXjuGc?t=95), 
		possibly complement with excercises for medial and/or lateral rotation [eg](http://exrx.net/Articulations/Hip.html#MedialRotation),
		fixed firm pose

* **Easily stoppable femur meets immovable outer butt muscles**
	
	* Why: Your glutes, piriformis, tensor etc are so tight (resting at a too short length) and/or hypertonic (resting in a to tense state) that they are literally blocking movement 
	by simply being in the way
	* What to do: A thorough stretching of the outer butt [eg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVqqt_4U_9s)

* **Lumbar spine has tight and/or hypertonic, grouchy muscles**

	* Why: Your hips properly positioning themselves for leg movements is crucial to the range of the movement, your lumbar spine is crucial to your hip being able to pull that off
	* What to do: Glute bridges, cat cow pose, lumbar rotation stretch, lower trunk rotation stretch, child's pose, pelvic tilts,  windshield wipers
PSA: Climbing while dehydrated is a terrible idea Seriously, don't do it, the lost pounds are not worth it. You'll feel like shit, climb like shit, and be knackered after 30 minutes.

~1 Week update on Iontophoresis for sweaty fingers Following up on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/793r4v/iontophoresis_electrocuting_yourself_to_stop/) here that enlightened me to use of iontophoresis for sweaty fingers. The Mark Anderson posts linked in the above thread if you don't want to click through are these:

* Post 1: https://rockclimberstrainingmanual.com/2016/09/08/witchcraft-for-perfect-skin/
* Post 2: https://rockclimberstrainingmanual.com/2016/09/21/iontophoresis-part-ii/

-------------------

**Background**: I have really sweaty fingers when I'm warmed up which leads me to sweat off chalk on any climb I'm on in about 1-2 moves.

-------------------

**Set-up**:

Went to Walmart and got

* 2 of the 2-pack Rayovac 6V batteries ~$10
* 1 3-pack Aluminum pie tins ~$2
* 3 of the 2-pack alligator clips ~$6

Set up the 6V batteries in series (+ to -, + to -, and so on) and connect the + to one tin and - to the other. Only use 3 of the 6V batteries, and it's intense enough. Add some salt to the water to induce more electrical conductivity.

Side effects: it is slightly shocking to go into the water, and it feels somewhat like low level pins and needles or tingly while in there depending on the hand. Nothing serious but just weird. The only issue is if you have open skin for some reason like a skin tag it can hurt.

Album + skin quality: https://imgur.com/a/acjjB

-------------------

**Results**: 

* Day 1 - 18V, 20 mins (1 polar) - No noticable effect as I didn't climb
* Day 2 - 18V, 15 mins (7.5 each) - ~20-30% decrease in sweating. Can go 3-4 moves without sweating through all chalk
* Day 3 - Rest
* Day 4 - 18V, 15 mins (7.5 each) - ~ 40-50% decrease in sweating. Can go up to 4-6ish moves without sweating through all chalk
* Day 5 - Rest
* Day 6 - 18V, 10 mins (5 each) - 
* Day 7 - 18V, 10 mins (5 each) - Climbing was consistent at around 40-50%ish decrease
* Day 8 - Rest
* Day 9 - Climbing today, going to ionto today too, perhaps before

Day 2 I went back and read the stuff again, and I didn't notice that you weren't supposed to do it all one way. So halfway through the next session I switched the cables on the tins (one at a time so you don't shock yourself!) so you get the direct current in the other direction. 

Days 5-9 - Trying to find where I can get a bit more effect with least amount of effort. It's kinda boring to put both hands in the tins and just sit there... maybe I should pair it with some meditation and deep breathing. 

There's definitely a bigger effect if you do it longer (and probably more if you do it with more voltage), but I don't know if I have the patience for longer and more voltage would be more shocking so I'm gonna pass on that.

**Other notes**: 

* If I watch climbing videos, my fingers will still sweat more than if I'm climbing which is really weird. I'll take the reduction on the wall over when watching climbing vids
* My skin was more sensitive after the first couple sessions, probably because I'm wetting it and then having it dry. However, after a few sessions climbing it toughened back up. 
* Skin it also more dry when not climbing as well which has been somewhat of a plus as my fingers sometimes get sweaty throughout the day
* I have NOT been outside again since I've done this, so we'll see once I go outside. Red Rocks trip next weekend.

I'll keep track of it for another week or two and do a follow up post then.
[Critique Request] My "Get to 5.12a" climbing training plan Hey Folks!  Long time lurker here, I've admired the amount of solid, science-based advice found in this sub, and I'm thirsty for more in the form of a critique of my seasonal training plan to get to 5.12a!

##TL;DR
***
Here's our plan...

###**Phase 1** (6 weeks): 
The goal here is to improve overall strength.

| Exercise   | Duration    | Notes     |
|:-----------|:------------|:------------|
|Hangboard|2x Weekly  | We are using the Anderson Brother's repeater routine to improve absolute strength.  We are also using a counterweight (-20lbs, and decreasing) to reduce the chance of injury.  Two days of rest between each session.
| Supplementary Strength  | 3x Weekly |   Weighted Pull Ups, Weighted Leg Raises &amp; Levers, Rows, Bicep Curls, Overhead Press, Dips, Lower Back Strengthening.  We choose 3-4 of these to do each day thrice a week.  
| Lead Climbing |4x Weekly |   No more than 4 moderately challenging routes (usually around 60ft each).  Goal is to prevent loss of mental game/technique/mental game.    
| Rice Bucket | 2x Weekly |   We do this when we do hangboard to minimize the risk of injury.

**Nutrition:** Eating a caloric excess to facilitate muscle growth.

###**Phase 2** (4 weeks):
The goal here is to improve strength endurance.

| Exercise   | Duration    | Notes     |
|:-----------|:------------|:------------|
|4x4s| 3x Weekly  | *Instead of resting*, we are going upstairs and doing ~25 reps of supplementary strength training (next row). 
| Supplementary Strength  | 3x Weekly |   Weighted Pull Ups, Weighted Leg Raises &amp; Levers, Rows, Bicep Curls, Overhead Press, Dips, Lower Back Strengthening.  We do 25 reps between each 4x4 set.  
| Lead Climbing |4x Weekly |   No more than 4 moderately challenging routes (usually around 60ft each).  Goal is to prevent loss of mental game/technique/mental game.    

**Nutrition:** Eating a *very slight* caloric deficit to facilitate fat loss.


###**Phase 3** (2 Weeks):
The goal here is to sendddddddddd (on a more serious note, we want to gradually increase our redpoint limit all the way to 5.12 in March 2018). 

| Exercise   | Duration    | Notes     |
|:-----------|:------------|:------------|
|Lead Climbing| 4x Weekly  | Goal is to push ourselves into higher and higher grades (ideally, outside).
| Supplementary Strength  | 3x Weekly |   Weighted Pull Ups, Weighted Leg Raises &amp; Levers, Rows, Bicep Curls, Overhead Press, Dips, Lower Back Strengthening.  
| Lead Climbing |4x Weekly |   No more than 4 moderately challenging routes (usually around 60ft each).  Goal is to prevent loss of mental game/technique/mental game.    

**Nutrition:** Eating a caloric baseline to maintain ideal climbing weight.


###**Phase 4** (1 Week):
This is just a rest week between training cycles.

**Nutrition:** Eating a caloric deficit to minimize fat gain due to inactivity.

Then....Repeat all 4 phases until swole af.

## Why are we doing this?
***

We (my girl and I) basically want to break into 5.12a by March, 2018.  That's it!  Tired of getting super pumped on 5.10s, and we want to be able to open up all the different route options that the elusive 5.12 grade has to offer.

We think that a focus on finger strength will help tremendously with our ability to endure on longer, pumpy climbs (if we're only using 10% of our total finger/forearm strength, it's much easier to endure), and aim to boost our overall fitness with 4 weeks of power-endurance prior to our 2 performance weeks.


##Some Background
***

I'm male, 5'9", weighing 155lbs @ ~10% bodyfat.

I currently can flash most V5s in the gym, and can project most V6/V7s and get them after a few attempts.  Best I have done outside is a single V7 at Stonefort, TN.

With lead, I can flash most 5.10s (though overhang reduces me to a 5.9 climber), and 5.11s are achievable if on a completely vertical with at least one decent rest.

Outside, I've redpointed a short, bouldery 5.11b in Rifle (beautiful climbing there, btw!) and most 5.10s are doable for me in 1-2 attempts.

We climb at Stone Summit Atlanta, which is notorious for really long (60-70 feet), overhung routes.

This plan is based off the Anderson brothers training plan, mixed with some other plans from TrainingBeta.com and general knowledge acquired from here and other climbing training material.

For mental game, we're currently focusing on not clipping anchor draws and jumping off instead.

##What Am I Looking For?
***
Basically, I'm looking for answers to these questions:

 * If we do this for 6+ months, is there a high likelihood that we are going to hit our goal?  
 * Are there any glaring issues with our training plan?
 * Any other general advice from you sexy climbing beasts?

***

Anyway, thanks for your time folks (I know it's quite the wall of text) -- I'll post some updates as we progress through the plan if anyone's interested. :)
[Discussion] The importance of strength is overstated because strength is the easiest thing to measure. Is strength the foundation for all other performance attributes, or just the most obvious?
Five Minutes Routine....Thoughts? Andres Bisharat has posted a grease-the-groove style hangboard/kettlebell workout called [Five Minute Fingers](http://eveningsends.com/five-minute-fingers/).  The idea is that some studies have shown that gains can be made with very submaximal work (particularly when working isomorphic positions).

Sounds interesting enough that I'd try it.  I suspect the fingerboard work would need to be VERY submaximal (like 30%-ish) to avoid injury with such a short warm-up.

I've had success with other GtG approaches (to one arm push-ups and pistol squats), so I figure this is worth a try.
Being stronger is more fun. With all these arguments about whether you should train strength, power and fitness outside of  just climbing or not I think this is being forgotten.  It's fun to have excess power.  

It's great to use perfect technique but sometimes it's just better to power through a tough sequence.  Power can also allow you to have better technique.  Sometimes it's even more efficient than using intermediates.  Every situation is different.  When you're trying to onsight you need the extra fitness.

Would you rather be forced into one sequence or have the luxury of excess sequences?  Power, strength and fitness allow for more options.  Climb gracefully as you can. Go for it without thinking when you need to.
Anaerobic Training IS Aerobic Saw a tweet from Martin Gibala, a noted exercise scientist that has conducted a lot of research on things such as "HIT": https://twitter.com/gibalam/status/930433670242095105
which links to: http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/277/5/E890

I felt the point was relevant to this Reddit because of how much people cite endurance as being a weakness and think that only low intensity training, such as ARC'ing, is suitable for improving endurance or markers of endurance.  So I figured these references might be helpful, since many PE protocols, or simply any protocol that produces high amounts of lactate with incomplete rests, might be more potent stimuli for improving endurance in climbing for most populations.  Most being a caveat as newer climbers likely cannot complete such sessions with quality and super high level climbers need to be careful since such sessions are going to be much more metabolically and physically (skin, tendons, taxing.

**I am not saying climbing does not have an aerobic component.  I am not saying no one should ARC.  What I AM saying is that climbers seem to have a very dyadic view of energy systems- it's either aerobic or it's not.  Then, when they lack the ability to send long routes, they equate route length not doing low intensity work of the same length.  In reality, they get plenty of work that produces aerobic gains and it is unlikely given the duration and intensity of what they are doing that true aerobic capacity needs to be trained through long, continuous intervals in a traditional sense. Please read below the citations for an edit on when each might be useful and under what context**

With caveats:

* I am not saying ARC'ing is bad.  I think aerobic metabolism in climbing is widely misunderstood and viewed through just one lens.

* There seems to be a strong correlation for ARC'ing improving the fitness of experienced climbers however, this is rarely separated or accounted for by variables with a high correlation such as a reduction in training intensity (which could lead to more recovery between sessions), the ability to work on movement patterns in high volume, and simply a change in stimulus (especially if one is mainly coming from short, sub 20s climbs).

* These studies mainly look at endurance sports.  Climbing is not necessarily an endurance sport, however, the effects of specific types of training on various skeletal muscle and vascular markers is similar.

* This list is not exhaustive nor is it perfect.  Simply to introduce the idea that increases in capilarization, mitochondrial function, and aerobic capacity can be obtained through high intensity exercise similar to power endurance, strength endurance, and anaerobic training protocols.

* Specificity still matters most. If you're doing extremely long climbs where you are on a 60m route or aiming to climb multipitch stuff with a fast pace, chances are you'll need something at a different end of the continuum then a 40 move pumpy sport route.

* There are several protocols in climbing that do not involve ARC'ing and are not 4x4s that authors have recommended.  Specifically: Lattice's 20min endurance workout of 10x1min climbing 1 min rest; Horst/Bechtel's EMOM bouldering working from 10 to 20 problems EMOM; Bechtel's continuous intervals of climbing a problem then downclimbing and resting on the wall until a 3min interval has been completed and then repeating; Anglin's endurance circuits; and Maisch's 5x5min of continuous climbing.

If you don't want to read further, the PE work and climbing/bouldering you are likely already doing, a long as the dose is increased over time and recovery happens, is already improving aerobic function.

[HIIT vs Continuous Endurance Training: Battle of the Aerobic Titans](https://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/HIITvsCardio.html)
TL;DR- 
&gt;"Increased mitochondria (the energy factory of the cell) size and number is becoming a hallmark adaptation to HIIT (Gibala, 2009). This is referred to as an increase in mitochondria density, and has been thought for many years to only occur from chronic endurance training. "

Also an easy read with a citation gold mine.

[The impact of high-intensity interval training versus moderate-intensity continuous training on vascular function: a systematic review and meta-analysis.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25771785)
TL;DR- 
&gt;"HIIT is more effective at improving brachial artery vascular function than MICT, perhaps due to its tendency to positively influence CRF, traditional CVD risk factors, oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin sensitivity. However, the variability in the secondary outcome measures, coupled with the small sample sizes in these studies, limits this finding. Nonetheless, this review suggests that 4 × 4 HIIT, three times per week for at least 12 weeks, is a powerful form of exercise to enhance vascular function."

HIIT indicated to produce substantial changes in capillary remodeling: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/jphysiol.2012.245456/full

[The scientific basis for high-intensity interval training: optimising training programmes and maximising performance in highly trained endurance athletes.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11772161)
TL;DR- 
&gt; " It seems that, for athletes who are already trained, improvements in endurance performance can be achieved only through high-intensity interval training (HIT)." and &gt;"Instead, an increase in skeletal muscle buffering capacity may be one mechanism responsible for an improvement in endurance performance." but also &gt;"Changes in plasma volume, stroke volume, as well as muscle cation pumps, myoglobin, capillary density and fibre type characteristics have yet to be investigated in response to HIT with the highly trained athlete."

[Study investigating 1:2 work:rest ratio for HIIT](http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2011/04000/Aerobic_and_Anaerobic_Changes_with_High_Intensity.31.aspx)
TL;DR-Work with normal PE prescriptions significantly improves aerobic endurance.

[Sprint interval and endurance training are equally effective in increasing muscle microvascular density....](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22946099)
TL;DR- Done on sedentary males, but demonstrates HIIT improves capillary density as much as LISS or more in some cases.

[Mechanisms for exercise training-induced increases in skeletal muscle blood flow capacity: differences with interval sprint training versus aerobic endurance training.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19258658)
TL;DR- 
&gt;"Based on the results discussed herein we conclude that the importance of each of these mechanisms varies throughout muscle tissue due to interactions of muscle fiber-type composition and muscle fiber recruitment patterns during exercise. The distribution of vascular adaptive changes varies with mode of training. For example, IST has been shown to produce the greatest relative increase in contractile activity in fast-twitch, white, skeletal muscle" Very relevant to climbing.

[Effect of concurrent strength and endurance training on skeletal muscle properties and hormone concentrations in humans.](A significant increase in capillary per fibre ratio was noted after 12 weeks of training in group SE.)
TL;DR- 
&gt;"A significant increase in capillary per fibre ratio was noted after 12 weeks of training in group SE." Probably a stretch to apply to climbing, but using some transitory logic if PE or work with incomplete rests improves endurance, and we get strength work from bouldering, hangboarding, and campus'ing, we might be doing a lot to maximize endurance performance.

[Similar metabolic adaptations during exercise after low volume sprint interval and traditional endurance training in humans](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/jphysiol.2007.142109/abstract)
TL;DR- 
&gt;"Given the markedly lower training volume in the SIT group, these data suggest that high-intensity interval training is a time-efficient strategy to increase skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and induce specific metabolic adaptations during exercise that are comparable to traditional ET"

* We need to stop confusing aerobic and anaerobic training with periodization. If you are working primarily on strength and are mainly limit bouldering with no PE or anaerobic work, then other things will suffer. This is the drawback of linear and block periodization, which Maisch and Bechtel address. Don't expect to train strength, do 1 cycle of repeaters, and jump on long routes and expect to be good to go.

* If you follow linear training cycles and don't maintain a capacity, expect to have to build it to some degree again.  Isolate this from a specific modality.  Within the capacity you need to match it to the specificity of what you are doing.

* There might be a much larger debate that I don't know enough about to influence, but many climbers follow linear periodization and it seems those that do benefit from lower intensity work quite a bit.  This is self-fulfilling at best.  Don't do something and it don't do anything that can influence it downstream and it will suffer.

* Performing anaerobic work can help to maintain some aerobic capacity and build it.  It has to be dosed correctly and progressively.  Don't expect to do it 2x/week year round and benefit.  Instead, do a 3-4 microcycle gradually building up volume to a peak week.  Rest and repeat or move on.  Don't spend that many blocks in a row dosing the same.  This goes with anything, but incredibly so with energy systems work that is much more transient than say, working up in strength.

* Related to this point, ARC'ing and low intensity work if done right can be great once a week during many phases provided they do not negatively impact recovery. If you read/listen to what Maisch and Bechtel have written, however, their version of maintaining aerobic or anaerobic capacity involves work harder than ARC'ing to avoid it's pitfalls, but their programs keep it in once every 7-10 days.

* Even sports such as running and cycling mix in speed work, neuromuscular work, or anaerobic work once every 7-14 days even in base phases. Often more often.

* Related to climbing the same principles apply. Don't expect to maintain what you are not doing. You can maintain some anaerobic and aerobic capacity simply by climbing routes or doing any number of appropriate workouts once a week.

* Likewise, I am wondering about how often those that complain of aerobic capacity issues are actually working with the lower to middle portion of their route pyramid or maintaining their capacity. This is where grade levels come more into play. A 5.14d climber like Anderson likely has 13s at the bottom of his pyramid, which are going to be a lot more taxing to run some laps on or do a long day at the crag on versus the 5.12 climber who has 10s and jugfests at the bottom of theirs.

* Boulderers or people who came from a strength-first background might see more impact from easier aerobic work than others. People that just "climb" for years and include a decent amount of trad or sport climbing likely have built up some capacity simply by climbing. Again, specificity comes into play. You're going to likely not be great at what you haven't done.

* Once you build up decent anaerobic or aerobic capacity they tend to come back fast and are hard to lose if you maintain them. In a linear approach in Horst, Anderson, and the Self Coached climber, there is little to no maintenance. This might be fine for someone working towards one single project that can hone in 100%. I doubt many climbers are of that caliber or can be that accurate in their self reflection. The same goes for pros in other sports. Every cyclist thinks they need the massive focus of someone peaking for a Grand Tour, when in reality what they really need is just to remain well rounded and have short bouts of focus.
Avoiding "Louis Parkinson Syndrome" So I wanted some advice/ to start a discussion about improving technique for climbers that have a bad tendancy to use excess power on moves they shouldn't need it on (ie Louis Parkinson Syndrome - a super strong British boulderer famed for his power and tendancy to cut loose). He said he learned bad technique when he started because he was too strong and that made him even stronger in a feedback loop.

Are there any methods you use to improve technique other than simply being mindful about using good technique on easier climbs?
First week of Iontophoresis for sweaty fingers - another log A while back I posted if any people had heard about iontophoresis as a means to reduce sweaty hands. I first came across it on reddit, where it linked to the Anderson brothers' site. /u/eshlow was then kind enough to try it for himself and posted a very detailed first week log, which motivated and inspired me not only to try it but to post a log here of my own.

These are the Anderson's posts:
Post 1: https://rockclimberstrainingmanual.com/2016/09/08/witchcraft-for-perfect-skin/
Post 2: https://rockclimberstrainingmanual.com/2016/09/21/iontophoresis-part-ii/

The previous thread I posted: https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/793r4v/iontophoresis_electrocuting_yourself_to_stop/
/u/eshlow's log: https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/7azttq/1_week_update_on_iontophoresis_for_sweaty_fingers/

----

Background: I have really sweaty fingers when I'm warmed up which leads me to sweat off chalk on any climb I'm on in about 1-2 moves. (same as Eshlow)

----

Set-up: 

- 4x 6V batteries (can't remember the exact price since I got a bunch of items, but I believe it was maybe 20 euro tops, probably less)
- 4 alligator clips (6 euro), and some leftover electrical wiring (I've ordered real clips on Amazon in the mean time)
- 2x Aluminum trays, 3 euro for 5 or so. I need to find bigger ones to rest my hands comfortably
- A dishwashing cloth to put on the bottom and sides of the trays as to not touch the metal

I won't go through the rest of the setup, the others posts cover that.

----

Protocol:

I'm doing this during my rest week, so the earliest I will be climbing is 4 days after the first session (Monday first session, Friday climbing).

- Day 1 - 12V, 20 mins (1 polar) - I tried 6V first, noticed it didn't hurt and then went up to 12V immediately. Even after reading the previous mentioned posts I still managed to make the same mistake and didn't change the polarity in the middle of the session.
- Day 2 - 18V, 20 mins (10 each polarity) - More pins and needles, but no pain, just mild discomfort. Covered any cuts and scrapes, as well as my nailbeds in vaseline.
- Day 3 - 18V, 20 mins (10 each)
- Day 4 - 18V, 20 mins (10 each)
- Day 5 - 18V, 20 mins (10 each) (and first day of climbing)
- Day 6 - I was lazy :-)
- Day 8 - Second day climbing 
- Day 9 - 18V, 20 mins (10 each)

My plan from here on out is to only do it on rest days, that should give me 3 or 4 days of iontophoresis per week.

-----


Results:

On day 1 as I woke up I noticed my hands may have been a bit dryer than usual. Hard to tell if it's just bias or placebo effect or so. I noticed I did sweat the same amount while watching a climbing video.

Day 3 just after the session I noticed some very white skin, as if the top most layer was about to peel off. Probably could have torn it off easily if I wanted to. I reckon this is just the exposure to the water, as if I've been under the shower too long. Where I often shower ever day I decided to maybe not shower on days where I know I'll be home all day (I work from home) and do iontophoresis.

Day 5 was interesting and exciting, as it was the first day climbing after my rest week, and I'd finally get to see results. I had been paying attention to my skin all week and I was prepared to feel disappointed since I did still get clammy, sweaty hands from time to time. However, the opposite was true. I think /u/eshlow was kinda close saying 40-50% improvement. I doubt it was more, but it was a very very good improvement nonetheless.

To give you an example of what this felt like. Previously when I climbed a boulder problem, even easier ones, as soon as there is a hold that I would actually have to bear down on or pinch (rather than loosely grip) I would come on off the wall and my fingertips (the actual pads) would be somewhat red, and there'd be no trace of chalk left. I could rub my hands to try to spread the chalk but unless I was climbing easy stuff I would always chalk up again.

Now though, instead of the red looking pads without chalk, they look more like the rest of my skin and there are some very small traces of chalk on it. I can rub my hands and the chalk will spread nicely (instead of coming right off since they are so moist) and I don't actually have to chalk up again.

Between my first and second climbing session I didn't do it at all, and noticed a very slight decrease in effectiveness, but almost not noticeable.

Let me know if anyone has any questions. Happy to try and answer them. All in all, I would recommend that anyone with sweaty hands ditch the Antihydral (the effects of which I never really noticed) in favor of this. 10/10 would DIY again.
Stretching Regimens for Hips/Legs I recently injured my arm, and consequentially have a lot of free time on my hands. I'm currently VERY inflexible. Does anybody have any good stretching regimens they can recommend, specifically for the leg/hip flexibility that is useful for climbing?

I'm less interested in general body wellness and more interested in improving my ability to do high heel hooks, high steps etc. 

**also on a side note, has anyone who has gained a lot of flexibility noticed a decrease in the effectives of "stepping" style heal moves (when you use the outside of your heal on a high edge to press with instead of a toe)?
Time to V10 for those who dedicate themselves to it I know the "how long to V10" question has been asked before, but usually you get answers that it's "infinite" because most people just go to the gym 2-3 times per week and dick around etc.

By "dedicate themselves" I mean either climbing or hangboarding 4-5 times per week, 3x weekly strength training, maybe some cardio thrown in there etc. Or whatever you think would be neccessary.

So just wondering, is it still like that even with guys who put in serious effort? If it is that would mean genetics play the biggest role in getting there and that only those who have talent at the start get there.

I don't have any particular aspirations about doing it myself. Would be nice within 2 decades I guess. But just wondering, seemed like there was a gap in what was discussed before.
Requesting a copy of Will Anglin's forearm exercises! Hey all! A while ago, u/cptwangles had posted some forearm exercises on his old blog. I had saved it, but since they moved to Tension's website as the new blog, I haven't been able to recover it. Does anyone have the list of exercises that he suggests? I'm a big fan of forearm work, and even if it's pre/rehab, it at least makes my forearms look like a boss, even when I'm sucking at climbing!
Overthinking Periodization and Training Calendars This seems to come up with a lot of friends lately who feel that they need to plan out 6 months of training at a time with meticulous focus.  While yes, that *can* work, it's sufficient as opposed to necessary.

The takeaway of this post is that you just need to do the fuckin' work.  You could sit down and say "I want to do 20 strength sessions, 15 an cap sessions, and 15 volume sessions" and it's likely that just hitting those checklists matters much more than if you arranged them precisely but only did 90% of the work.

Linear periodization is still widely used and great, but with a huge caveat; it's typically used in very elite athletes who are training for one specific day or performance.  Olympic track cyclists periodize on a 4 year schedule.  Imagine how boring that would be for climbing.  Many sports have a few marquee events in which smaller events might be used for preparation.

The reason I posted a few links to cycling studies is that the general idea of the training year is very similar.  Racers tend to have a few peak periods or events and race the rest of the year to gain physical and mental skills.  You can't replace racing with training.  Climbing in a gym is cool, but it ain't the same as getting outside on a rock.

Unless you're trying to take down a few lifetime projects.  But remember that athletes that tend to use linear periodization for this are truly the top of their class or have a shitload of expertise us mere mortals don't.  It's not likely someone needs a RCTM-like program to climb 5.12 or crush on their yearly trip.  In fact, it could actually make the performance worse since they're not physiologically well rounded enough during most of the year to make the most of training days and the things that matter.

[Study on Endurance Athletes finds no significant differences in the order of interval protocols across a macrocycle](http://bit.ly/2BAX04q)
**TL;DR** Just do the work, all of, and try not to get imbalanced in your training.

[Another study finds block periodization provides more improvement than traditional linear distribution(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22646668)

[Same idea, but 12w instead of 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23134196)
**TL;DR** and key takeaway is that the group improved their lactate threshold and vo2max by front loading their intervals, which would mean training an cap and aero pow much earlier in a macrocycle in climbing

[This study corroborates the prior](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25648345)

[What about strength athletes?!?!?! Well, same effect](http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/1994/11000/Periodization__The_Effect_on_Strength_of.6.aspx)

[Undulating periodization could be superior to linear in strength athletes](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wayne_Phillips3/publication/297344418_A_comparison_of_linear_and_daily_undulating_periodized_programs_with_equated_volume_and_intensity_for_local_muscular_endurance/links/57adfd8d08ae0101f1726fab/A-comparison-of-linear-and-daily-undulating-periodized-programs-with-equated-volume-and-intensity-for-local-muscular-endurance.pdf)

**TL;DR** Maisch and Bechtel are proponents of undulating/escalating block periodization.  Or should I say, constantly training the 2 to 3 most important things linked to climbing performance year round with temporary increases or decreases for projects, trips, or switching foci.

[But you probably should still periodize somewhat](http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/abstract/1999/02000/periodized_strength_training__a_critical_review.15.aspx)
**TL;DR** Switch it up on a regular basis.
Less Is More: For a Seasonal Approach to Training i'm training again after what I would term a "casual" (2 days a week with mostly moderate routes/boulders; focused on flash/onsite and zero projecting) relationship with climbing since April. this is my second year deploying this loose strategy during the summer.  this has clearly helped prevent both burnout (i coach 3x a week) and injury, but is it a reasonable approach for pursuing outdoor projects?  here are my observations:

1) my max hangboard #s continue to rise annually despite months and months of apparent neglect. sure, it takes a few sessions to knock the cobwebs off, but i can get to 95% of PRs within two weeks. last winter i broke a 4 year hangboard record by almost 30 lbs.

2) same goes for power. 1-4-6 (metolius large) on day 1. 1-4-7 metolius large on day 3. i'll be working the smalls again by January.

3) last winter i was able to send a long term project (v10/11ish) and put up several hard FAs within a month of my return to training.

3) not surprisingly I started with low stamina at the higher grades, but it doesn't take much time to max out capacity when you're looking at doing less than 100 moves in a session. day one i was able to repeat a v10 and then... i was practically done. day two i was able to do the same v10, repeat a v8, and work hard moves on several other v9-11 boulders. day three i was able to climb hard for almost two hours. poof; ready to send rigs. like magic.

takeaways: the most important thing for improvement is consistent climbing sans lengthy layoffs. you don't need to train power and finger strength year round to improve on boulders (routes require a whole different array of aerobic adaptations which are necessarily time consuming).  

caveats:  i'm almost 40 so i'm looking at a different recovery window than someone in their mid 20's.  that said, i would still suggest younger athletes err on the side of less training.  it was hard for me to see how the boom/bust cycle of my late 20's and early 30's affected my long term improvement until i had a long period sans injury.  8 months on at %110 followed by 4 months of Xbox One is waaaaaaay less effective than 12 months at 60%.  

build strength and power and then chill.  build and chill.  focus on tactics, don't get hurt, and turn on the juice when the weather gets good.

hope everyone is doing well!

Are "Modern" Gyms Really Better? (Or, Long Live the Dirtbag Dungeons) First, a little background.  I've been climbing for nearly 30 years.  In the mid-to-late 1990s, I worked at, and later ran, a climbing gym in the Rust Belt that just celebrated its 25th anniversary (it was the usual wood construction that many gyms had at the time, and despite some expansion over the years, the gym never really upgraded the walls themselves).  More recently, I was an early investor in a "modern," Walltopia-based gym that opened in my hometown.  

The new gym is, in short, amazing.  The walls are beautiful, the space open and well-lit.  There is a training area (Moon Board, steep woody and system board, huge campus board), plus free weights, various pull-up bars, hang boards, kettlebells...the whole nine yards.  The route setting is generally pretty good, and if there's a so-so set, there's always the Moon Board or the woody.  I love it, and can't really imagine going back to the old gym, despite my history with it.  It is cramped, dusty, and old.

But...I can't help but see all of the images of the new gyms that are popping up everywhere, and think they all look the same.  Soaring, colorful Walltopia walls.  Perfect padding.  Brand new, colorful holds.  Lots of pretty climbers, taking perfect selfies or videos of their latest sends.  How is my new gym really any different?  What makes it unique?  And is it really better?  Is it making me a better climber?

The short answer is, yeah, it is making me a better climber, or, at least one who is better motivated to get better.   But, I do kinda miss the old, unique-in-its-own-crappy-way gym.  Should we as a community be sad when a [dirtbag dungeon](https://www.patagonia.com/blog/2013/10/long-live-the-dirtbag-dungeons/) has to close because a new, fancy gym opened on the other side of town?

And, of course, as an investor in one of these new gyms, I'm glad to see it busy with lots of perfect young people, because those young people are a ticket to early dividends on my investment.

Anyway...what do folks think about this?  Do you prefer the clean, modern gyms that are popping up everywhere?  Or do you prefer your dungeons, dusty and grungy as they are?
Things I Have Found Useful I thought it might be a good idea to have a single thread where people could make note of things that they have found useful in climbing harder in their own experience.  There is a plethora of information on every aspect of climbing itself not to mention the accompanying physiological, structural, and mental things that feed into it that it's worth noting personal correlations that others may find useful in order to better sift through things.

I was thinking of the following format for any specific piece of information:

* Category: Mobility/prehab, mental preparation, lifestyle management, diet/wellness, cross-training/strength training, technique/fitness.

* What you did

* Why you did it it

* TL;DR prescription including reference

* Results

This thread doesn't have to be academic, but any links, citation, or rationale would be helpful

Here is an example from me:
* Category: Mobility/prehab

* Deep tissue massage in teres, rhomoids, lats, pecs, and traps

* Taller climbers tend to have weak(er) cores and poor shoulder mobility/stability.  I work the strength and stability aspect of things in the gym, but was not improving my mobility.  In specific, shoulder mobility when my arms are overhead is so poor that it inhibits anterior core strength and firing.

* Prescription: 1hr every 2 weeks

* Results: My bad shoulder on my left side now has 15 degrees more range of motion when doing a front raise with my lower back braced against a wall.  I have more rotational ability and have been able to execute more effective cross moves and retract my scapula more on overhung features.

Hopefully we can get some interesting experiences and information that can be helpful.
Warning, sassy and semi-serious campus statement incoming... ;) Tell me again why you need to be using the training apparatus that was designed to help a 5.14c climber send 5.14d in order to send your V6 project...
Is it just me... Or is everyone getting stronger? When I first started climbing V6 was a respectable grade. You wouldn't expect the average climber to get there, only the dirtbags, the pros, and the very dedicated climbers. Now it's a given. Everyone and their mom can climb V6 within a year or two, and most of these guys are capable of doing it outdoors too (some of them don't realize it, but that is different than being incapable of it). I remember doing my first outdoor V7 (4 years of climbing) and being one of the only ones in my friends group to have climbed a V7 outdoors. Now the guys that are the strongest ones in their groups are climbing V7's outdoors in 1 or 2 years and climbing V10's by 4 years. 

I can't remember the last time I had a gym session where I didn't notice someone with a year or two under their belts and wish I'd been that good or that strong when I was a year or two into climbing. 

Anyone else noticing this phenomenon or is it just me? What do you think is the cause? Larger pool of climbers? Better training information? Climbers training earlier in their careers?
The Beta Angel Project: a working database of synthesized climbing training research. A small group has read, categorized, and summarized the findings of dozens (hundreds?) of papers. The goal is for the community to continuously contribute and and improve the database.
I'm planning to make a Hangboard company in the near future... Your input would be appreciated :) Hey Guys and Gals, I have been sitting on the idea of making Hangboards for a while now and I'm in the process of designing a few. I'm planning on making them a little different from the usual boards out there. Before starting I just wanted to reach out to the community to see if any of you have anything you would like to see in a hangboard that would make training better. Whether it be convenience or ingenuity let me know what you would like to see in your ideal board.

Thank you in advance for your thoughts :)
Fuckarounditis https://leangains.com/fuckarounditis/

With all the shit popping up about these specialized this and that for climbing I am reminded of a terribly annoying period of S&amp;C- the early 2000's.  Squats on Bosu balls. One leg 1 arm kettlebell rotation with resistance bands. Dudes spending an hour on mobility drills every day, yet are still weak and immobile.

Brace yo'self. Climbing is about to go through this with a gusto.  Smart (usually strong) people are reading old texts, finding ways it might benefit this or that, and everyone is stoked on these new cures and the tumbleweed of fuckin around starts rolling.

Every coach ever has said it- this is a skill sport. You can't fake that.  Weird fuckaround this and that won't help.  Basics.  They're basic for a reason.

Where is S&amp;C now?  Most of this stuff has fallen off the radar.  The basics prevailed, still. Some elites mess with very targeted modalities, but the shit storm has settled and what has been useful has stuck.

Don't be afraid to try things, but don't let yourself be convinced by the latest IG specialist doing something super questionable.  If they need paragraphs to explain it, it's probably fuckin' around.
Point/Counterpoint - Climbing: Skill vs. Strength Sport I started writing this in response to /u/cptwangles post in the [Deliberate Practice thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/7kmg6f/deliberate_practice/) (great thread, btw), but thought it might be enough of a tl;dr derail to warrant its own discussion.

&gt; Climbing is a skill sport more than a strength sport. You will gain strength while practicing climbing skill, but you won’t gain climbing skill through physical training.

I have a very different take on this. Climbing certainly has more of a skill component than "pure" strength/fitness sports, like weightlifting or running. But I would argue that it has a lesser skill component than most "traditional" competitive sports, like tennis or basketball.

For the sake of argument, we can even say that climbing is equal to those more traditional sports in terms of the skill-strength balance. As the Freakonomics article mentions, just playing tennis games or bball scrimmages does not amount to purposeful, let alone deliberate, practice. So why should climbing be different?

For all 3 sports, just doing the activity itself would be an important part of any training plan, but not enough on its own to qualify as purposeful/deliberate practice. P/D practice also entails breaking down the activity into more fundamental pieces and working on those. I think we would all agree that part of the way to do this for any sport, including climbing, is through through movement/technique drills or exercises -- things like practicing tennis serves, jump shots, or climbing an overhang without cutting feet.

But for other sports, it wouldn't stop here. You would also include strength and conditioning exercises / physical training. Even though this training might not directly build your sport-skill, it's still valuable insofar as it's a more effective and efficient way to build the strength and conditioning required to excel in your sport. And this would be true even if you're not hoping to get drafted in the NBA or make the ATP World Tour, even if you're just playing rec league ball or getting ready for the tournament at the local tennis club.

On the other hand, maybe you just want to play the occasional pick-up bball game or keep the rust off for your monthly mixed doubles game with your buddies. Sure, yeah, then maybe you forgo the S&amp;C exercises and even the movement/technique drills, and just focus your time on scrimmaging.

I don't think climbing training is significantly different. Yes, you should do a LOT of actual climbing. And yes, you should do drills or exercises focused on specific movement or technique you want to work on. And yes, you should do exercises to build strength and conditioning while actually on the wall. And yes, you should do strength and conditioning exercises that don't entail actually climbing as well, which may include hangboarding, campusing, shoulder mobility/strengthening, core exercises, etc. No, you shouldn't "just climb" as the sole means to improvement. How you balance all these elements varies based on individual needs/circumstances, but there are numerous comprehensive resources these days that provide "off the shelf" programs that make for pretty good jumping off points for the majority of climbing trainees. 

FWIW, I get the appeal of "just climb more" as advice here, given the high volume of low-effort posts about having been to the gym once and what's the best way to send the purple V5 next time??? For the sake of discussion, let's just assume we're talking about individuals who are dedicated to improving their climbing, such that they want to start a journey of purposeful/deliberate practice.

Anyway, that's enough of a ramble. Would love to hear others' thoughts -- and criticisms, of course! :)
Injury risk, limit boulder projects, and what "listening to your body" means in practice Yesterday I had a pretty good gym session - flashed a pocket-y "V7", worked an overhanging big-moves V6 til I finished it, nearly linked up a similar V6 (more linear holds, more roof work, big moves at the top) before I started to get tired and left. I felt great when I left the gym, but a few minutes afterwards, the base of my left middle finger started hurting in half-crimp but not open orientations - I've taped up around the A2 today and it helps, so based on past experience it's just lightly tweaked and will be fine with rest and attention.

Here's the thing that gets me: I was at the gym for 1h50m total with a 20m warm-up, took rests between project attempts, worked out beta methodically, and still wound up with a low-grade injury that didn't become apparent til after I'd left. The V6s I tried both featured moves where you hang off a locked off left hold and push off a right foot chip to bring the right hand up and out for a big move, and I couldn't nail the move from an open crimp on the left hand. The cumulative load of near-max half crimps was probably what borked my finger, but was also what the problem demanded.

A lot of the messaging around injury prevention in climbing is "listen to your body," "switch up your grips," and things like that - how do you safely project a boulder problem that necessitates repeatedly trying the same holds when your body's pain and fatigue thresholds are higher than your injury threshold? What - *specifically* - do you do to check in and prevent minor injuries, and how do you expand out that definition of "listening to your body" while pushing harder grades?
Correct One-Arm Hang Posture i've been one-arm max hanging frequently these last few weeks, and a comment from a friend about my  hanging posture had me wondering: what is the best lock-off angle and hanging posture for one-arm hangs? This question breaks down along a two dimensions

1. **Lock-off angle**: In [my own max hangs](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdGpGDXFfZk/?taken-by=danielnegless), I tend toward a nearly 90 degree lockoff, whereas someone like [Kyra Condie](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc7q3YeA6iA/?taken-by=kyracondie) is only slightly bent. Is there an angle that is best for isolating finger strength and/or minimizing body wear &amp; tear?

2. **Rotation**: So here, Kyra [keeps an square position](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc7q3YeA6iA/?taken-by=kyracondie) with respect to the hangboard, whereas when I one-arm hang, I tend to rotate inwards, like doing a one-arm pullup. Is this inward rotation bad form? Is it better to maintain the open, square posture, or does it not matter for finger-strengthening purposes? Note: because I broke my back in October, my core is super weak, and I have to [really press with my fingers](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc-GfDjlAUG/?taken-by=danielnegless) to prevent this inward rotation.
Coaches of climbharder, tell me about your athlete who most outperforms their physical talents We talk a lot about getting stronger in a tangible, physical way, but I'd like to hear more about the wizards who just "get it" on the wall, and what kinds of skills &amp; habits they share.
What would you consider your "climbing breakthrough"? Not necessarily the moment when you broke through a plateau, but any humbling moment or sudden realization that changed your perspective on climbing/training for the better.
Lynn Hill, on reading holds to create fluid movement — I had never thought of this for footholds before, and as a beginner who badly wants to move fluidly, I find it fascinating. Solid climbers, do you think/do this? Any tips on applying/learning it?
2017 Training Logs Review #2017 Workout year in review:

Started Jan 3rd, 2017
Currently Jan 3rd, 2018

I created a thread summarizing everything I did in the [first 6 months of this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/6j2zhp/6_month_training_logs_review/), so I figured I’d share how the whole year went overall.

**Number of cycles:** 11

**Number of Hangboard sessions:** 64 sessions

**Number of additional workouts:** 85

**Number of Core workouts:** 61+

**Number of non-consistent workout types:** Too many

**Gym grade Pyramid:** V9x1, V8x4, V7x14, V6x25+

#Hangboard Numbers:

- Max weight added: BW+65lbs for full 10 seconds. Did +90lbs for 2 seconds and +70lbs for 8 seconds.

- First half the year was odd, switching between repeaters, and frequent, shorter hangs, etc. Second half I dug in and got more consistent doing 4- 6 sets of max hangs for the full 10 seconds.

- I experimented with a month of repeaters, and came away disliking them more than I expected. I don’t think I’m going to dabble with them again until I see a distinct plateau with max hangs.

#Core Training:
- Probably the single biggest change I’ve ever seen in my climbing after introducing this.

- Ab Rollouts on a wheel or Olympic rings was the key for me, as it’s progress able, high intensity, short duration, and doesn’t tax other muscle group already tired from climbing.

- I progressed from having to kneel with my knees basically under the rings, to having to stand, to having feet quite a ways behind the rings. This made a huge impact on how easy it was to apply and use tension and core on the wall.

#Summary:

- The second half of the year was significantly more consistent than the first half. That is also here the majority of my harder sends resided. I didn’t get any gym V7’s until April, and then got like 8 in the last 2 months of the year. All V8’s were in the second half of the year as well.

- Core workouts have now become consistent. Finding something that was difficult, but short duration made me much more likely to perform the workout
I want to add one more additional workout to this. I’m thinking One Arm pull up progression for now, but I’m going to spend some time finding what fits in the schedule best.

- Not entirely sure how to use my rating system. I’m not sure it’s adding information to the logs. My favorite quote from my logs is “Rating: 5/10 + 6/10 + 3/10 + 2/10 = 4/10 - my worst session in a while, literally probably shouldn’t have been there”. I think a more binary system would be better. Maybe Bad, Average, Good, or something like that? I’m overly optimistic, so I think I’d have a lot of “Good” sessions.

- I think I’ve created a good balance between limit bouldering, and building pyramid volume. I don’t think I need to try to create a better peak, and I don’t know if I need to fill it out any more than I already am. 

- Need to always be critical and analytical about what my weaknesses are, and what I need to spend my time on to make sure I’m addressing them.

- The first half of the year, my consistency was really low with additional workouts. Right now I’m consistent with fingers, core and climbing, but I would like to add one more thing to that list.

- Things I’d like to do more of. Climb with better climbers. I don’t always get a chance to do this, but I’d like to try to search out, and session things with better climbers than me.

- Things I’d like to improve: Session quality. Many of my sessions are too long (2-4 hours), and that has a direct impact on how well I hang. Convincing myself that I can cut a session off when I’m fully primed, hangboarding, then coming back to clean things up is helping, but still hard to do.

#Outdoor Performance:

[8a.nu Boulder Scorecard linked](https://i.imgur.com/St4DPVM.jpg)

[8a.nu Route scorecard](https://i.imgur.com/U8leHRh.jpg) - much more pitiful.

- Got my first outdoor V8,but didn’t do any new V7’s of note in 2017 (only one trick dyno). I’m very close on many, but none yet. Got most of my all time V6’s in ‘17 tho, excluding maybe 2 or 3. Filled out a bunch of V5’s, making them a nice wide base.

- For Ropes, I got my first 5.12b, and another 5.12a, as well as a handful of 5.11’s. I’d like to fill this out better this year.
3D Printed Hangboard Hangboards are expensive, so I attempted to design my own with simplicity in mind, so if anyone wants the file, here you go:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/col2igfjj98h0qw/Hangboard%201%20v6.f3d?dl=0

And if you happen to find a flaw, feel free to reach out and lmk.

Heres a picture before you download:

https://gyazo.com/3c62a7e2289822eb7aa93ee9852b5c01

Dimensions: 4.5 x 3.5
Each crimp is about 3.2 inches wide
.75 in, .5 in, .3 in. crimps

They should be able to be printed on smaller 3d printers, and depending on the print quality, they absolutely should hold weight. Print two, space them out appropriately, bam.

EDIT: So if you decide to print this, make sure you print it at relatively high-quality print rate. The crimps most likely will not fracture and flake off, even with 150lbs+ simply because of the angle of the force, but the sloper at the top might.

For a really strong final product, create a mold and fill it with Polyurethane Resin. Wiki: "Currently, a large quantity of commercial holds are made of polyurethane (often called urethane in the USA) or a polyurethane mixture. Polyurethane is lighter, more flexible, and less prone to chipping and breakage than polyester or natural materials."
How to work on climbing flexibility Flexibility has almost always been a weak spot of mine, Especially hip flexibility
 I was wondering if anyone has a cheat sheet of important stretches for climbing or any flexibility in general. thanks a ton!
Thank you all so much!!! I posted here a few months ago about climbing at a higher weight, and you all were so welcoming and kind. This is a pic from my second bouldering session at Highpoint in Birmingham Alabama. I love climbing!!!
Critique my climbing! https://youtu.be/42W9HsTsayg
Didn't manage to get the send but looking for ways to improve my climbing! Any advice would be appreciated :)
What are your favorite skills drills? When I'm in the gym I prefer to work on outdoor applicable skills, some of my favorites are; traverse but  your follow foot can only use the hold your lead foot is on, doing the same drill with hands, another favorite is ladder lead climbing, (clip the first bolt and down climb to the start without touching ground, then up  to clip #2 and back down the start, rinse and repeat until you hit the top) what are some of your favorites?
Personal experience focusing on the wrong strengths/weaknesses Hey all, this post is to generate a discussion to see if anyone else has had this experience.  I've been climbing for 6 years now, and for most of that time I was also lifting weights regularly.  I always had the mindset that if I improved general strength, it would make me a stronger and better boulderer.  I would usually climb every other day and lift weights twice a week. 

About 6 months ago, I dropped all supplemental strength training except pullups and hangboarding.  I noticed a dramatic improvement in my climbing sessions and my training sessions.  My grippul numbers went up way past what they were at when I was doing chest/shoulders/kettlebells regularly.  I also noticed a dramatic drop in the number of sessions where I unexpectedly felt weak and didn't have any good reason to point to.    

Basically I realized that as a V6 climber in decent shape, my weaknesses were not primarily due to a lack of body strength, and thus weightlifting was a waste of recovery resources.  Allocating more time to climbing and focusing on finger strength has resulted in noticeable improvements.  

I'm lurking here a lot, but hardly ever post, so I figured I'd share my experience. Takeaway - if anyone else is feeling plateaued and is trying to break through by adding a bunch of weight training... think about where your weaknesses are, and consider that maybe what you need is less and not more.  Cheers!
SUBREDDIT ANNOUNCEMENT: Weekly Injury Thread and Weekly Simple Questions Thread have been combined! As the title says, we will now have a single recurring weekly thread for both simple questions AND injury questions.

The reasoning for this is mostly that as the weekly injury thread goes away people start creating individual posts which we then often delete, and as the simple questions thread goes away people create individual posts which we often delete.

With this new thread **ALL LOW-EFFORT SIMPLE QUESTION POSTS AND ALL INJURY POSTS WILL BE DELETED!** We'll try this format out for a little while and if it ends up not going over well we can switch back to another method, but for now if you see a post that you think ought to to go in the weekly thread, inform the poster and click "report". The automoderator will remove it after **2** reports.

If you think your post was UNREASONABLY removed, message the moderators and we'll either restore it or inform you why we feel it should stay removed.

Thanks everyone!
Recurring Low Energy and Weak Climbing Days Hi reddit, I have a quick issue that’s been severely affecting my climbing and training as a whole.

Over the summer, I climbed/trained 5-6 days a week at times for 5 hours or more. Maybe I had one bad day every once in a while, but as a whole, I could climb pretty well every day. My sleep and diet was nothing special— if anything, it was awful. 

However, in the past few months, I haven’t been able to even compare to this summer. Looking back through my training logs, I’ve only had 3-5 days that I haven’t said “weak day, awful, no energy, weak, couldn’t climb, no motivation, etc”. It feels like I physically can’t climb like myself anymore. My training is much less consistent than the summer now, so I doubt it’s overtraining. The only thing I could find different that I did before some of my strong days was arcing. I haven’t arced in months, so would that cause this weakness?

For reference, I get about 6-8 hours of sleep every day and I have a very carb heavy diet. 6 foot and 150-155pds depending on the day.

I’m not asking to climb hard every day— it would just be nice to climb normally at least a few times a week... if anyone has any history with this issue or knows anything, any advice would be amazing. Thank you!
I designed and am building a tool that lets you mount crimps to a sliding board. My original plan was just a fun game to 1v1 people in finger strength (like Asana used to sell) but I'm now planning to add swappable load cells and tensioning so that I may be able to use it for training. Thoughts?
Climbharder meetup BISHOP: MARCH Crimpin and I are looking at dates around March 8th-17th

Hope to see some of ya'll there as well!!!! The more the merrier
Instructions on how to build a crack trainer at home I know what a crack is and the theory of how to use it, but like a gym born mostly sport climber, cracks aren't natural and I'm not all that good at them - I'm more likely to cheat a 5.8 crack with a 5.11 face hold than have all four limbs in the crack.  I want to get good enough for classic climbs like Indian Creek and big grade 3 routes out west.  Unfortunately, my gym has no cracks (great in every other way).  I'm looking for detailed instructions on how to build a good crack system.  My key questions are:

* what is the best orientation - vertical (what'd I'd likely actually climb outside), horizontal (easy to set up on saw horses and the ultimate training), or somewhere in between?  If horizontal, I guess [this one](https://mojagear.com/journal/2016/05/23/build-home-crack-machine/) is about the simplest and most effective - corollary, will I actually be able to use a horizontal crack or is it so far advanced beyond my skills that I shouldn't bother?
* Is the 8-9 foot high ceiling in my unfinished basement good enough space, its like one mover vertically?  I live where its too cold in the winter to reliably train without heat, so its really basement or bust for any winter training.  Is a winter/weather proof system for the back yard (3-season trainer) a better option to allow for more height?
* What's the best way to mount the crack system to my house structure (I own the house)?  Basement is cinderblock walls, exposed joists in the ceiling, poured concrete floor.

And more specifically for the crack itself, I know board flexing is best avoided.  Spacer blocks seem common to make a defined width and limit flex.  What is the recommended block spacing - every 4 feet?  does that get in the way when using the crack?  Is external bracing a practical option?

Iontophoresis update with antihydral experiment This is an update on these three posts on iontophoresis:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/793r4v/iontophoresis_electrocuting_yourself_to_stop/

* https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/7azttq/1_week_update_on_iontophoresis_for_sweaty_fingers/

* https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/7e8foc/first_week_of_iontophoresis_for_sweaty_fingers/

My first update was the 2nd post above.

----------------------------

**Iontophoresis update**

So I ended up taking a couple week break after the first ionto experiment, tried a few different others. Here are the short details.

* I tried doing 12V for 20-30 mintues instead of 18V for 10-20 minutes. Didn't work at all. 100% of the sweating came back.
* I nixed that because it didn't work, and went back to 18V and got reduced sweating up to the 50-70% range again.

Overall, it was extremely tedious to do it pretty much everyday. I don't know what was going on, but my fingers sort of "adapted" to the iontophoresis so I had to do it everyday instead of eventually bringing it down to 2-3x a week. It was really annoying to set up so I sort of gave up.

----------------------------

**Antihydral experiment**

There's several articles which recommend anti-hydral for climbing.

* http://eveningsends.com/review-antihydral/
* http://squamishclimbingmagazine.ca/antihydral-skin-doping-for-climbers/
* http://www.svilen.info/index.php/climbing/climbing-blog/49-antihydral-a-tabu-in-climbing

All of these in particular recommend [this anti-hydral](http://shop.foosball.com/antihydral.html). There are other different types of anti-hydral as well like Rhinoskin, but I only test the one in the previous sentence.

First, I did research on the active ingredient which is methenamine. Methenamine decomposes into ammonia and formaldehyde which apparently dries out the skin. Derivatives of methenamine are used for fighting various infections in kids. Here is the [data fact sheet](https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+563) from the government. 

&gt; At the time of this review, the manufacturer reports no
        carcinogenic potential. However, although causality has
        not been established, methenamine was implicated as a
        possible cause of increased skin and gastrointestinal
        cancers in workers who handled methenamine in a factory
        setting. 

This seems to be the main risk, but those who handle it all the time vs applying to your skin once or twice every few weeks is much less. So potentially not that harmful even though formaldehyde is a known carcinogen. Probably due to the very small (?) amounts? 

The main reason why I decided to try it is that methenamine is used orally for treatment of UTI. Apparently, if it's safe to go into your body in limited amounts to fight infections, it's probably safe topically in limited amounts. That's an acceptable level of risk for me.

Of course, any use is at your own risk.

**Application**

I discussed with several climbers who use this on how they use it. Most suggested you apply it overnight before sleep and wash it off the next morning. I ended up trying to apply it once overnight and it didn't do much after a few days. Then I applied it 2x overnight + 30 minutes the day after and my skin started to toughen up for 2 weeks now.

Apparently, it usually takes a couple times to "set" with the skin. If your fingers are more sweaty it could take up to 3-5 times (one climber I know) in a row per night to set on the skin. My skin happens to only sweat during climbing and are generally dry at other times, so I ended up with dry skin with 2 days + 30 minutes.

**Results**

Here's what my fingertip skin looked like after ~2 weeks: https://i.imgur.com/gRzYkBt.jpg -- zero sweat on the fingertips whereas you can see the rest of my fingers and hand are sweaty after climbs.

* 1-2 days after the consecutive applications, my fingertips pretty much didn't sweat at all. See above photo.
* This has continued for about 2 weeks.
* About 10 days into it, my skin became a bit more "glossy" which means holding onto plastic indoors was similar to having my hands sweat. Unfortunate for indoor climbing.
* I haven't tried it yet, but I'm pretty sure I can offset the glossy skin with sandpaper, so it would still end up better. 
* Outdoors, where there is more "grit" on holds especially in the area I'm in (Black Mountain, Joshua Tree) it's probably fine although I haven't gone outside since I applied. Trying to get outside next week, so I'll see what happens.

Anti-hydral is probably what I'll be sticking with from now on since it's easier to apply and generally less costly in the long run. I can probably deal with the deficiency on plastic with sandpaper or a gritty file but that is TBD.
Performance climbing diet? Hi, all. Lately I've been able to attribute much of how I'm feeling on the wall to what I've been putting in my body beforehand. While I have a pretty solid idea of what the good stuff is, I'm always looking to clean it up a bit. So, what do you eat every day to climb your hardest? What diet should I undergo to maximize my potential?
Eric Horst Programs (w/ spreadsheets) for Grade Ranges https://trainingforclimbing.com/training-programs/

Hadn't seen this til now. Many have pointed out that after reading training for climbing by Eric Horst you have a wealth of exercises you could do but no real programming. These free spreadsheets would be a pretty good fix to that and might be a great starting point for a lot of folks who don't want to part with $20 for training books/ebooks and are starting out. Most of the exercises are self explanatory and the rest can be figured out with you tube tutorials from Eric himself. While these do not even begin to offer insight into how to approach improving movement on the wall a search of this subreddit for drills, how to work weaknesses and how to try hard will make this clearer. I'm not the most experienced person on this sub but I feel that when starting it's best to just stick to a good general program designed by a coach to get a feel for training activities. These offer you that for free. Thoughts, criticisms, over complications?

Cheers!
How long should I have climbed before training on hang boards and campus boards I've seen a lot of posts saying to just climb early on, which I'd agree with. I'm about 6 months into climbing and am pushing V5, and I'm noticing a lot of smaller crimps and bigger volumes I've got to hold onto. Is it still to early? If not, what should I be doing, and when, how much, and before or after climbing. Thank you in advance and sorry for all the questions!
Re-doing the same problem over and over after sending. So recently I’ve been trying to focus on some harder problems than I would normally tackle. After sending them I would do the problem over and over until it feels and looks really easy and effortless. 

However, I’m wondering if this is going to be beneficial when it comes to harder problems. With that I mean: would it make more sense to do more problems of the same grade, or continue to focus on really refining one problem’s beta and execution before moving on to the next? 

I’m asking this because some people, strong people, were surprised that I was climbing the same thing over and over again. Honestly, I don’t have any idea if this type of training makes any sense.
Power endurance or endurance? I've been climbing for a long time and I've always had a weakness, though I'm not quite sure if it's power endurance or regular endurance. Basically, I can climb more or less endlessly on anything 11d or below so long as it doesn't have severe overhang, and even if I get pumped, I can shake out on more or less any hold and keep going. However, as soon as I have a roof longer than 20 feet or a 12c (or harder) sequence that goes on for longer than about 15-20 moves, I get super pumped in my forearms only and it gets really hard to get it back. Would this be a power endurance or endurance?

Depending on which it is, what kind of drills help with this kind of weakness?

EDIT: Here are some videos of me climbing if it helps:

6b+ (~5.11c) onsight, 2 month training plan, did I start endurance too early? I’m a reasonably experienced (10 years) but not great (French grade 6b+ onsight max, that’s about 5.10c I think) climber. Endurance has always been a weakness of mine so this year, in preparation for April/May trips, I started training in January. At the moment I climb 2x/week, as below. I only do routes and try to only focus on overhanging ones.

Lead climbing at the wall, 7-9 long overhanging routes. I typically don’t push myself to complete failure, truth be told I will ask my belayer to take rather than fall most of the times… Typical session will be: 5+ warm-up, 6a warm-up, then 4-5 steep routes of close to my max onsight level which is around 6b+; towards the end of a 2hr session I’d be getting pumped, and I’ll switch to either easier steep routes (6a+) or vertical, rather than overhanging.

Auto-belay climbing at the wall, 12-15 gently overhanging routes done to failure – I climb until I can’t hold on any longer and my hand opens up on a crimp. I usually do these routes in pairs, with the second being easier. So I’d do 6b+ followed by 6a+, then rest a few minutes, then repeat. Towards the end of the session I’m too tired to maintain that level, and the pairs will end up being 6b followed by 6a, etc.

What obvious tweaks to my training program would you recommend?

As I understand, this is “sort of” power endurance training, is that right? Shouldn’t I be limiting power endurance to just 4-5 weeks cycles, then switch to some other type of traininig? It’s mid-Feb, and I want to be ready for trips in early April and May.
I need some advice on lock-offs. Please comment if you have had/someone you know has personal experience with the advice. I want to develop a stronger lock-off for the next usa climbing season. I am able to do a one armed pull-up, but I can't do a lock-off for more than 15 seconds. Ive been training my lock-offs by holding 5 seconds with a 10 pound dumbbell, but as soon as I hang for a little longer it feels impossible. I feel like my pulling strength is fine but my lock-off strength is lacking. Is anyone else having this issue? Could it have to do with my endurance? What training should I do to get stronger lock-offs? What muscles should I train to get a stronger lock-off? Some info about me: 5'8'' 16 years old 130 pounds (I recently gained 10 pounds over the last 2 months). Thank you in advance.
Training advice for weak female climber? *You can skip to the TL;DR for my question, the first two paragraphs are mostly me talking about myself.*

I'm 23F, and have been climbing an average of three times a week since I started in December 2016. The hardest bouldering problems I've sent are V6, and I usually can climb V4-V5 (all indoors). On top rope I have sent as hard as 11C (at the gym). I'm really happy with the progress I've made, but I feel like upper body strength is a serious limiting factor for me. Before I started climbing, I was a distance runner and did next to no upper body work. I managed my first pull-up in the same month that I climbed my first V6 (10 months after I started climbing), and unsurprisingly the routes I do best on are flat, fingery climbs. Compared to other climbers at my level, I'm better at reading beta and getting weight onto my feet, and I have stronger fingers, but I routinely struggle on powerful moves and spend days or weeks nailing body positioning and practicing sequences because that's the only way I can leverage my limited upper body strength to do the moves.

For a long time I wasn't bothering with strength training since the standard advice seems to be to just climb for the first while, your issues are from poor technique, not lack of strength. I am increasingly feeling like strength training would help me, but when I looked into training strength and power for climbing, I found that a lot of the routines and exercises people suggest are too challenging for me. I do work on hard bouldering problems, but beyond that it's pretty clear that most training suggestions are aimed at stronger, better climbers than me.

**TL;DR**:
I would love to have input from female climbers who were in my position - what did you do to work strength? Any tips? And I would really appreciate advice or resources from anyone that would help me come up with a strength program I could do a couple of times a week to supplement my climbing, or suggestions for how to structure my climbing training in order to improve power. 

Oh also, I am 5'8", so height/reach isn't really an issue for me very often.

Thanks for any input!
Approaching Projects Systematically One of my goals for 2018 was to send a V7 indoors, and [I finally managed to do it today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5IC4LkIyO0).

Usually, my projects meander for a while until I feel lucky enough to send one day, but I wanted to write up an approach I tried to get in the zone more consistently and give myself the best chance for great conditions. None of this is new, but hopefully someone else will get something out of this.

**1. Selecting the project**

I wasn't on the lookout for anything particularly soft, but I explicitly selected something in my style - heel hook heavy, compression, and powerful dynamic moves. Most importantly, I needed it to be fun to do. I've previously burned out on longer-term projects when I really wasn't feeling the problem, and what's the point of climbing if you're not having fun?

**2. [We talkin' about practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGDBR2L5kzI)**

Perfect practice makes perfect climbing. I made sure to spend time isolating only the moves that I couldn't do consistently. One of my sessions was spent doing a single move until I could do it perfectly.

I told myself that rather than trying to send with every attempt, the point was to give each attempt as much mental and physical effort possible. That was a much healthier attitude that let me stay psyched throughout sessions.

**3. Eat well, and rest well**

Once I was confident I could get past the cruxes, I refined my diet a bit (no drinking, no foods that make my feel shitty), and made sure my sleep schedule was tight. I stopped all my training and climbing 4 days before attempting the boulder from the ground, so I could be as fresh as possible.

**4. Visualization really works**

Even though I wasn't doing any climbing, whenever I had a spare moment to concentrate, I imagined myself on the wall, and went through the moves in my head. Don't ask me why, but it works.

**5. Think positively and try hard**

When friends asked me what I was doing over the weekend, I always responded with "I'm going to my climbing gym to send my first V7". [I even posted the same thing here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/7ymoe9/weekly_rclimbharder_hangout_thread_for_february/dukayni/) I didn't feel any additional pressure by sharing it, but the repetition did build my confidence - I knew every move was possible, and all that was left was to link it together.

As I got on the wall for my send attempt, the only thought in my head was to try hard. My favorite lesson from *The Inner Game of Tennis* has been to trust my body to perform the way I've trained it, and to stop letting my mind interfere with the work I've done.

It wasn't the prettiest top, but it was enough!

Any other strategies or tips for projecting? I'm curious what helps r/climbharder get in the best condition for sending.
Experienced climbers, what non-climbing/training habits have had a significant impact on your ability? With all the training-focused posts, I thought I'd start a different type of conversation this week. Climbers with years under their belts, what kind of habits that do not requiring physical effort (i.e. no climbing or training) have helped you in the past or currently? I am not the best spokesperson for this topic as I only have a few years, but here is a list to kickstart the discussion and provide a format to copy. I love to see everyone's introspections. No worries about redundant posts, just list what habits you think helped you.

&amp;nbsp;

♥♥♥ (Very helpful)

* Recording and analyzing videos of my climbs
* Making friends with strong climbers
* Studying videos of pro climbers
* Mentally rehearsing projects
* Learning and listening to the limits of my body

&amp;nbsp;

♥♥ (Somewhat helpful)

* Finding belay partners that you trust
* Reading climbing literature
* Asking other climbers for feedback on your climbing
* Practice clipping
* Writing down beta
* Finding progress when there is none

Plateaus, grades and retrospection Hi,

So I'm about to hit my third year since I started climbing and I want to share some thoughts that I feel relate with many of the post I see around here lately, mostly coming from beginners like me.

Technically, I have been climbing the same grades for a year and a half. During this time I have consolidated the lower base of my progression pyramid for sure but I didn't have any significant breakthrough grade wise.

And yet, I'm a much better climber than I was a year and a half before:

-I got into lead climbing (I mainly do bouldering) which help my endurance, mental game and breathing.

-My body awareness has improved a lot. I find it easier to indentify low energy position between movements and do micro adjustments and mental cues to go for the next move 

-I got rid (mostly) of my overcrimping habit which allows me to climb safely even when recovering. Learning how to open hand most of my climbs has had tons of beneficial side effects. Mental game, body positioning, etc.

-I learned the true meaning behind the importance of core strength. The strongest core means nothing if your mind and muscle memory cannot follow.

-Many other little improvements that where completely hidden to me a year and a half back which now I understand the importance of.

My main point with all this is that you will not see this changes in my grades. This improvements come from a better understanding of the sport and the weaknesses that hold you back.

TL:DR: Don't let a grade define your progress but learn how to assess your skill.
Finger rolls for finger strength: Experiment Update Heard about [finger rolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/7urhqq/deeper_look_into_finger_strength/) and it came up again a [couple weeks later](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/7wrk40/max_hangs_and_finger_rolls_concurrently/). Also, an [older post](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/6lrz8l/rotating_between_isometric_and_concentric_finger/).

Anyway, I said I'd try them out because I like to see if certain things work for me or not (e.g. [iontophoresis and antihydral experiments](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/7v192r/iontophoresis_update_with_antihydral_experiment/)). So here's the update. 

Here's a [video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiXGR4p1dwY) about how they are done.

The blurb on [Eric Horst's site](http://nicros.com/training/training-articles/eastern-bloc-training-heavy-finger-rolls/) suggests they're actually a very old exercise that has just been lost to the climbing community over time.

&gt; Todd Skinner turned me on to this exercise back in 1990, and I’ve since become a believer. Muscular gains from this exercise are reasonably quick and obvious, and they seem to translate fairly well to climbing despite the obvious lack of specificity to climbing.

&gt; Todd credits these finger rolls for some of his most significant gains in finger strength, since he first picked up on this exercise from Eastern Bloc climbers he meet on the World Cup circuit in 1987.

&gt; The Soviet climbers claimed that heavy finger rolls produce measurable gains in forearm circumference (a sign of muscle hypertrophy), whereas strength gains from fingerboard or campus training are primarily the result of neurological adaptations. This statement seems reasonable since the heavy finger rolls cause repeated, high-intensity eccentric and concentric contractions of the forearm muscles. Also, pairing up heavy finger rolls with plyometric training (e.g. campus training) could produce the synergistic gains that have been shown to result from the Complex Training protocol I advocate for advanced climbers (more on this in a future article!).

&gt; [...]

&gt; As far as weight is concerned, it must be HEAVY! Maximum strength training demands the use of an appropriately heavy weight that only allows you three to six very intense repetitions. Therefore, while finger rolls with a “light” weight (e.g. 30- or 40-pound dumbbells) may pump you up, they are ineffective for developing maximum finger strength. After a warm-up set with the bar weighted to about 50 percent of your body weight, the goal is six heavy sets with a good rest of three to five minutes between sets. A weight about equal to your bodyweight is a good first guess for a “working weight.” Add more weight if you can do more than six reps, or removed if you can’t do six sets of at least three repetitions. With practice, you should be able to build to 125 to 150 percent of body weight…AND build forearms of steel!

Also, [a mountain project post](https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/107783703/heavy-finger-rolls) on them.

--------------------

**My thoughts before starting**

Eric Horst's article with them suggested that these helped with increases in hypertrophy.

* Strength = neurological adaptations * muscle cross sectional area (hypertrophy)

Hypertrophy is [predicated on](http://www.lookgreatnaked.com/articles/mechanisms_of_muscle_hypertrophy.pdf):

* Maximal tension
* Muscle damage
* Metabolic stress

My thoughts before starting were that since the strength equation is basically neurological adaptations * muscle cross sectional area, finger rolls would be good at improving hypertrophy which would also directly increase strength. Not sure how much it would help, but I was expecting some improvement. Most high level climbers also have massive forearm hypertrophy, so I figured I might as well start now and hopefully get bigger forearms to help me in the long run.

I was overall unsure about how much my max strength would improve overall since I would be getting substantially less practice with half crimp specific movements. Finger rolls aren't necessarily "specific" to the joint angles that you hang with half crimp. Thus, I decided to keep at least 1 set of max hangs during this time to see if my max hangs would improve at all during this experiment. 

--------------------

**What I did**

I've been having a bit of nagging issue with my middle finger PIP joints, and higher rep work is good for connective tissue and joints. Thus, I decided to "modify" the program a bit instead of going super heavy in the 5 RM range to boost it up to at minimum in the 20 rep range.

Since I did NOT want to do both max hangs on hangboard and finger rolls and develop greater overuse injuries, what I did was:

* Reduce my volume for single arm max hangs to 1 or 2 sets for half crimp full pad or about 25mm. 
* Reduce my volume for single arm max hangs to 1 or 2 sets for half crimp ~14mm -- I would have preferred 10mm but [I'm working with... this.... hangboard](http://stephdavis.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hangboard-720x360.jpg) at the gym. Unfortunate, I know. 1 or 2 sets depending on how I feel. 
* I also removed open hand (3 finger drag) from my program since finger rolls would seem to double as open hand work basically. 
* I don't train pinch because it didn't really help me the few times I've tried.

Hanger 18 gyms are pretty meh as far as workout equipment goes.

--------------------

**Results** 

Initial test:

* 4-5x20 at 135 lbs with ~3-4 minutes rest between sets

A little bit sparse, I know. 

The first few sessions I ended up aiming to improve my reps with just the 135 lbs. Got to 25 reps, then 30. Then I started boosting up the weight. After that a couple of workouts alternated between working 20 and 40 reps. I ended up favoring a more endurance protocol since I was running short of time on some workout days, and I've been working a longer V10 project outside, which I punted the last V1-2 move at the end. So finger endurance was a more obvious route to go in conjunction with what I was working on outside.

Final results (over 4 week period):

* 1x20 at 225 lbs. The last couple workouts I went for a ~20 max rep set and end up being able to do 225. 
* 5-6x20 at 185 lbs with 60-90s rest between sets.
* Also tried a few "burnout" sets and was able to do 1x50 at 135 lbs about 3 weeks in. Huge rep gains here.

Overall, solid improvement going from around a RM of 135 lbs or about 90-100% of my bodyweight to 225 lbs or about 150% of my bodyweight as I run about 140-145 lbs. 

--------------------

**How did it translated to actual climbing?**:

* PIP joint soreness actually improved while on this protocol, even moving up weight. I did somewhat expect this, but it was good to confirm that this helped my injury.
* [Forearm hypertrophy increased substantially](https://imgur.com/8TAdU7r). Unfortunately, I did not think to take before/after pictures or measurements, but here is approximately how much my forearms hypertrophied over the course of the couple weeks. Yellow line is about where it started, and you can see where it is now. Much more noticeable definition with both flexors and extensors.
* The 1-2 sets of max hangs increased 15 lbs over the 4 weeks. I had been plateaued for a while. 
* My pinch grip noticeably improved on the wall. I think it might be because of the co-contraction of extensors during heavy flexor loading
* Not really "scientific" but the V10 project I mentioned above (over 3 sessions) started at "desperate" during the crux and moved to "reasonable" over the course of the workouts and would've went except for the punt. 
* Improved endurance and contact strength (which is also to be expected with improved max hangs and endurance reps).

Overall, I'm a believer. This is the best "one thing" I've found aside from actually climbing that seems to have increased my overall abilities fairly rapidly, at least with the 20+ rep protocol. I'm all about finding what works best for me personally. 

Bear in mind that I also do not do sport only bouldering, so some of the "gains" from the higher reps may also fall under newbie gains for me. I would suspect that climbers who do both sport and bouldering may experience less results than I did since their forearms may already be somewhat adapted to being pumped at high repetitions. However, they should still experience at least some hypertrophy and some hand strength gain.

This also seems like a solid "alternative" for maintaining finger strength if you're on vacation and can't really go to a gym. It would help substantially in staving off the loss of finger strength by continually working the FDS and FDP muscles. That's been one of my biggest issues with climbing as almost every year I've been climbing I've had 2-3 week breaks here and there from traveling, vacations, and whatnot which have stalled my progress for longer periods of times.

I would be interested to see how the 5-10 RM protocol would work, but my finger needs to heal up to full before I would try that. For now, I'm sticking between 20-50 reps and the current system I've set up. I'll probably post another update another month or two in. I highly doubt that my very good gains would continue on this trajectory, but there should still be some solid gains.

Anyway, I suggest adding these to your program for a month to give a try. You can try the 5 RM protocol, or my 20 RM protocol. I think you'll make good gains.
TrainingBeta Route Training Program Review TL;DR: This program has been great and I've seen positive results in my climbing. Went from 5.10/10+ max lead onsight to 5.11 max lead in about 4 weeks, and V2/V3 max to V4/V5.
_______________________

I started the route program 4 weeks ago. Some pertinent-ish background info in regards to levels - my gym sets super stiff, so extrapolate as you will. The last two gyms I'd been to prior to this program, my TR onsight max was 5.11+ / 5.12 -, so I've seen about a half to full level variance between my gym and some others.

I started this program to try and push through my year and a half plateau at 5.10, as well as to prepare for the outdoor season. Both my boyfriend and I have been doing this program, and we've seen similar results. 

Prior to this program, my training schedule was:

* **Climbing** - 3x per week for 3 hours. Generally warming up on 2-3 routes in the 5.8-5.9 range, and then jumping up to my project grade for a bit before ending on some mid-level routes. I did not have laps, 4x4's, or other similar power endurance elements in my training.
* **Hangboarding** - 1x per week. Metolius 10 min program on the simulator, usually after one of my weight training sessions.
* **Weight Training** - 2-3x per week. Would do deadlift, bench, and squat in addition to stablizer activities with the TRX for my shoulders (I/Y/T)
* **Running** - 1-2x per week. Usually 1-2 miles.
* **Yoga** - 1-2x per week.

Since starting the program, I've primarily only done the 3 days of training prescribed, plus some yoga or running where it fits in. 

A day in the TB program includes both on the wall time (90-120 minutes) and either a strength training circuit or stabilizer circuit afterwards. As such, my weight training days "went away", but actually ended up being combined in with my climbing days. 

Results after 4 weeks:

* Max lead onsight level increased from 5.10 / 10+ to 5.11
* Max bouldering level increased from V2/V3 to V4/V5
* Push-ups, pull-ups, and plank times all almost doubled (this program has testing days, and these are included in that)

As far as the program layout itself, the dashboard is very intuitive and you're given 3 workouts every week on the night prior to whenever you signed up. You can e-mail the team at TB and they'll change it for you without an issue if you want them sooner (i.e. we signed up on a Wednesday, asked to receive them on Sunday so we could plan our week). Only big downside is that there isn't a mobile app, so you have to pull up the workout in your phone's browser or print off in advance.

Our program started with a power endurance phase, which will last a total of 6 weeks. It then will move on to other phases in 6 week rounds (see program layout in [FAQ of TB](https://www.trainingbeta.com/how-to-use-route-training-program/))

**Is it worth your time and money? IMO - yes.** However, I know there are a lot of folks in this sub who already have very regimented training programs of their own that check a lot of the same boxes. I had tried some of the program (beginniner) from Horst, but found it to be really overwhelming and a lot to plan out. With my work schedule, having the workouts preplanned and sent to me every week  was worth the 12-14 bucks per month to save me time.

The other thing I liked is that I'm still weak in some critical areas - I can't do a pull-up, for instance  (I'm SO close after starting this program). The workout may prescribe weighted pull-ups, Frenchies, or some other variant that I can't do, but there are always notes on how to modify up or down depending on your fitness level. 

I won't make this an even larger wall of text, so I can try and answer questions in the comments as best I can! I saw a review of the bouldering program on here a while ago, but didn't see any notes on the route training program.

EDIT: Added note on what the 3 days of TB include. Also a note that this program isn't anything profound or new, it definitely supports what is outlined in this sub!
Is flashpump real? What is going physiologically that causes it to persist longer than getting pumped later in a session? Flashpumping is often casually mentioned within climbing literature ([example here, in PCC @ 8:20 - 8:50](http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/2018/2/25/episode-79-board-meetings-when-to-say-take)) but I have yet to see it focused on as an actual physiological concept with any degree of scientific nuance. 

Does anyone have any experience or literature that approaches it in a meaningful way?
Infinite Jest On Failing to Climb Harder Infinite Jest is a big ol' novel from the late 90s about a bunch of things, and one of those things is serious training among kids at a tennis academy. One passage struck me as very similar to training for climbing, so I've included it here.

*'What John's saying is the types who don't hang in there and slog on the patient road toward mastery are basically three. Types. You've got what he calls your Despairing type, who's fine as long as he's in the quick-improvement stage before a plateau, but then he hits a plateau and sees himself seem to stall, not getting better as fast or even seeming to get a little worse, and this type gives in to frustration and despair, because he hasn't got the humbleness and patience to hang in there and slog, and he can't stand the time he has to put in on plateaux, and what happens?*

*He bails, right. Then you've got your Obsessive type, so eager to plateau-hop he doesn't even know the word patient, much less humble or slog, when he gets stalled at a plateau he tries to like will and force himself off it, by sheer force of work and drill and will and practice, drilling and obsessively honing and working more and more, as in frantically, and he overdoes it and gets hurt, and pretty soon he's all chronically messed up with injuries, and he hobbles around on the court still obsessively overworking, until finally he's hardly even able to walk or swing, and his ranking plummets.*

*Then maybe the worst type, because it can cunningly masquerade as patience and humble frustration. You've got the Complacent type, who improves radically until he hits a plateau, and is content with the radical improvement he's made to get to the plateau, and doesn't mind staying at the plateau because it's comfortable and familiar, and he doesn't worry about getting off it, and pretty soon you find he's designed a whole game around compensating for the weaknesses and chinks in the armor the given plateau represents in his game, still -- his whole game is based on this plateau now. And little by little, guys he used to beat start beating him, locating the chinks of the plateau, and his rank starts to slide, but he'll say he doesn't care, he says he's in it for the love of the game, and he always smiles but there gets to be something sort of tight and hangdog about his smile, and he always smiles and is real nice to everybody and real good to have around but he keeps staying where he is while other guys hop plateaux, and he gets beat more and more, but he's content. Until one day there's a quiet knock at the door.'*
PCC Podcast Episode 80: Assessments with Steve Maisch http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/2018/3/7/episode-80-assessments-with-steve-maisch

Synopsis from PCC:

&gt;In this much requested episode I sit down with Salt Lake climber and coach Steve Maisch to discuss assessments. Steve had some of the first assessments I remember seeing online, and we go into how he's added, subtracted, and refined those. We talk a little about Steve's own assessments, and an important thing that he overlooked in his own training.

&gt;Many of us coaches are loosely collecting data for these assessments, but how important is it all, really? And are the standards anywhere near where they need to be? Stay tuned after the conversation for what comes dangerously close to a rant concerning the recent trend of measurements. 

Haven't listened yet but seems like it'll be of interest to folks here, the last pod between these two yielded a lot of good discussion.
Anyone else think we need a r/climbingcritique subreddit for all of the critique requests? To me, /r/climbharder is about pushing yourself, including doing your own self-assessment of what you could do to improve. While I see that having a community of climbers to analyze your videos for you is convenient and useful, I visit this subreddit so that *I* can climb harder, not so I can watch others who need help climbing harder.

While I suppose it would be possible to learn to climb harder from reading the critiques of the videos, since there is no "after" video showing the budding hardclimber implementing the suggestions, I have no idea which ones proved to be helpful.

Anyone else have thoughts on these critique requests? Should they just be clearly labeled CRITIQUE REQUEST: so that we can ignore them in our feeds?

EDIT: Sorry for my knee-jerk "can we put these in a different subreddit" suggestion! That was definitely a really bad suggestion. I agree that this is the right community for these critique requests....I just think that there is room for improvement in how to more efficiently/effectively address these posts.

EDIT 2: [This.](https://imgflip.com/i/267w87)
Puffy Swollen Knuckles, Synovitis, and you. Let’s talk. **Hey r/climbharder community!**

&amp;nbsp;

*This post is a LONG read and is going to seem all over the place. For those who take the time to read and comment, thank you for dealing with my terrible organization &amp; grammar.*

&amp;nbsp;

**Please take a second to complete this [Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/7xmjkmSPCKP8TlSl1). It’s for my own research, but if anyone else is interested I can share the results of the survey later down the road.**

&amp;nbsp;

The goal of this post is to reach out to any and all climbers who have encountered swollen joints in their fingers and discuss how long you’ve been dealing with it, what you did (or are doing), or if you’re still looking for an answer. My hope is that this thread opens up a discussion about our experiences with this injury that seems to be becoming a more common injury with climbers. I have combed through all the threads on this subforum and r/climbing regarding synovitis/swollen knuckles, but some are so old that there are deleted posts/comments. So let’s start a fresh discussion.

&amp;nbsp;

Swollen knuckles seem to be on the rise as the sport of climbing grows with tons of climbing gyms opening up at a rapid pace. Through this post, I hope to share my own experiences with swollen knuckles, gather old/new information from you guys (the fantastic community of Reddit), and for the next few weeks begin a training program to hopefully get rid of it for good. Whether I find a solution or not, I will post my results and all the details. 

&amp;nbsp;

**I think the biggest problem with swollen knuckles is that it’s an injury you can climb through. Since we’re able to climb through it, we don’t identify it as being a big issue, but we should if we’re thinking long term (ligament damage??), and want to progress.**

&amp;nbsp;

**A little background about myself**

&amp;nbsp;

I’m a 28 year old male. I’ve been climbing for 5 years. I mostly boulder. I’ve climbed up to V8 outdoors. I climb anywhere between 3-4 times a week, never more than 2 days in a row. About 2 and a half years into climbing, I noticed my knuckles starting to get inflamed. My two middle fingers are swollen at the PIP joint, with swelling being the most obvious on the side of the fingers. My left finger is worse than my right. At first I didn’t think anything of it. I thought beefy fingers meant I was getting stronger. I also didn’t have the knowledge or self-awareness that I have now to notice if I suffered any minor injury/tweak in my wrist, fingers, or forearm during those first years of learning to climb that may have lead to my joints swelling up. **I’ll be the first to admit, I have a chronic case.** I’ve been to the doctor, I’ve tried a few things here and there to try and reduce the swelling/heal them (no major commitment), and over the last couple of months I’ve read tons of articles/books regarding climbing injuries such as “Make or Break” (great book, i highly recommend.) 

&amp;nbsp;

**Synovitis**

&amp;nbsp;

As many of you who are reading this may have already guessed, it’s most likely/*is* *Synovitis*. For those of you who do not know what Synovitis is, check out this video: [Climbers &amp; Synovitis](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz-CHXwLQ_k) 

&amp;nbsp;

One discovery on social media surprised me. I was searching for pictures/stories of climbers with puffy knuckles, swollen knuckles, and synovitis. Jimmy Webb, a well known climber who is arguably one of the strongest boulderers today, has [this picture](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/XmQ0y) posted on his Instagram back in 2013. Not much info in the 8 comments posted, but it leaves me wondering if A.) He still has it today, or B.) he got rid of it for good. I want to believe the latter.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Problem**

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve thought about this a ton. Does this happen because of Diet? Genetics? Stress? Over climbing? Over gripping? Improper warmup? Not enough adequate rest? Gym climbing? Gym climbing is an interesting thought because it’s a completely different environment than climbing outside. A lot of the people I see at the gym (including myself) spend hours at the climbing gym and don’t properly rest between climbs during our first years of learning to climb. It wasn’t until I started climbing more outside that I started to realize the value of rest and resting between climbs, even at the gym. With todays route setting we put our bodies under a new kind of stress. There’s tons of side loading with your fingers, and you definitely see more climbs with gastons/sidepulls/weird movement off of them in gyms..something you don’t see as much climbing outside. 

&amp;nbsp;

Could it potentially be caused by a muscular imbalance? Bad circulation? Bad sleeping position? Poor flexibility? Chances are, it could be a little bit of all of these mentioned..

&amp;nbsp;

**Seeing a Professional**

&amp;nbsp;

It’s strange that I found out that I had Synovitis through the internet and my own research, not a doctor. A medical professional never diagnosed me with Synovitis. I think the most frustrating thing about seeing a doctor is that they don’t fully understand the amount of load/stress we put on our fingers (especially boulderers) when we climb, especially if you climb moderates/harder climbs with smaller holds. I hear a lot about great doctors in CO/Utah that are climbers themselves, and see these injuries more often. Unfortunately I have not found that kind of doctor near me here in California with a background in climbing.

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve seen three professionals: A regular Orthopedic doctor, a Sports Medicine Orthopedic Doctor, and also a certified body worker. It was interesting to see/hear each of their approaches and responses. The first ortho took an x-ray and a visual inspection. He asked me a few questions about my diet, went over the X-Rays and basically sent me off just telling me I didn’t have OA/RA, my bones were fine, that it was soft tissue damage around my joint, and that I could continue climbing. *For the record, that experience was a sour one*. Something inside me was telling me he was wrong, and it seemed like I was also being blown off. I wanted a second opinion. My second experience with the sports med ortho went similar. He seemed to be more knowledgeable with climbing injuries, but mainly pulley related. He wanted to take an MRI to get a more specific, concrete answer that an X-ray might not see. MRI came back with no troubles, and again, I left the doctors office without an answer. He asked me about a cortisone shot. Then he suggested a new, uninsured method of injection that I instantly rejected (an experimental blood platelet injection that would cost $1000 USD). A few weeks go by..I continue to climb, and one day I notice a lump forming near the top of my PIP joint. After a few more days, it grew a little more in size and when i flexed my finger, it would move. I knew it was a cyst. I went back to the doctors (first one), and he took another X-ray and said we could drain the cyst (*keep in mind that X-Rays can’t show you Cysts*). He drained it, and I requested a cortisone shot to maybe try and dull down the inflammation. Through my research I’ve always been against getting a cortisone shot, but it seemed like my last resort. My knuckle wasn’t getting any better and what if that cyst came back? I opted to try it out once. I got the cyst drained/cortisone shot during the last week of December 2017. After getting the shot, I rested for about a week, then started to hangboard again. After a couple of hanging sessions I started to climb again, and my finger felt AWESOME. But now, three months after getting the shot, the discomfort in my swollen knuckle has returned, and I’m afraid I’ve backtracked all the way to step one. *Could the cyst be caused by the long term effects of synovitis??*

&amp;nbsp;

**Something Different**

&amp;nbsp;

I think there’s some real value with physical therapy. After two frustrating trips to doctors, I decided to try something different. A good friend of mine from the gym who also happens to be a professional body worker/physical therapist offered me a free consult. I immediately said “yes” because i knew he’s been climbing for years and has worked with some top climbers/athletes at his practice. What really struck home about my consultation was that he suggested it might be a problem upstream that’s causing my poor finger joints to swell up. So i started thinking.. I started doing more research about the muscles in the forearm, the wrist, hand, and even shoulder. Could it be a problem in my elbow that’s trickling down to my fingers? With this new train of thought  I now had more questions than before. Before I knew it, frustration mounted. How far down the rabbit hole can this go? I started reading about muscle imbalances and about how flexibility effects different parts of the body. After some light reading I decided to test myself. It came as a bit of a shock when I discovered that my wrist/forearm extensor muscle flexibility was poor. This imbalance made sense though. Climbers work the flexor muscles in forearms by pulling down and our poor extensor muscles don’t get worked out with the same amount of weight/intensity, causing an imbalance. These muscle imbalances probably aren’t an end all solution, but it opened my eyes to the possibility that it could be musculoskeletal issue in my forearms/wrist/elbow that was causing a clog at the end of the line (the fingers).  He ended the session with a trigger point/myofascial release massage on my wrist/forearm which I could feel all the way down in my fingers. It immediately improved my ROM but obviously one little massage session wasn’t going to be a one stop fix. It got me thinking though..Could PT be the answer? I believe the answer is Yes. 

&amp;nbsp;

**So, what are you going to do about it?**

&amp;nbsp;

As mentioned earlier in this post, I tried a couple of things to alleviate/get rid of my swollen knuckles without any major commitment. To be honest, it was half-assed recovery and mostly my ego holding me back in terms of resting and concentrating on recovery. What’s changed since then is that I actually want to get better. I feel like this injury is holding back my progression and it doesn’t make any sense to train on injured fingers/joints. My biggest problem was putting climbing in the backseat. There comes a point in time when we have to kick ourselves in the ass, and that’s what I’m doing now. Time to work those neglected muscles, give them love, and **STRETCH**. I’ m going to attempt to go through PT by myself. I think my lack of knowledge with working out other muscles that don’t get worked through climbing really put me on the back burner. Time to strengthen them and attempt to restore balance in my forearms. 

&amp;nbsp;

**The Plan**

&amp;nbsp;

I’m going to stop climbing. I need to take a break and let my body rest. Over the next 6 weeks I’m going to devote my gym time to increasing my ROM/flexibility in the fingers, wrists, forearms, and shoulders. I’m going to focus on putting as much love into my body as I put into climbing. Since this is an experiment, I won’t dive into what exactly my training regimen is going to be to fight my swollen knuckles. If it ends up working, I will post my results after the six weeks is over and what I did during those weeks.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Struggle**

&amp;nbsp;

What if there’s no improvement after six weeks? Do I go another 2 weeks? Another month? It’s a grey area for sure. I think the most important thing to remember is that at least I’m trying *something*, as opposed to doing **nothing**. If I see no improvement, I’ll plan on seeing a Physical Therapist and see what they have to say. 

&amp;nbsp;

**In Conclusion**

&amp;nbsp;

Synovitis/Swollen knuckles are tough to make go away. There’s no overnight cure. Whether you have had it for a week, a month, a couple of months, or a year+, it’s not optimal to be climbing with swollen joints. If you have a chronic case, it’s definitely not something that can easily go away on its own. I’m definitely more of a chronic case. I hope someone out there also had a chronic case and is now free of synovitis/swollen knuckles. As I said in the beginning of this post, I hope we can open a discussion about your own experiences and maybe.. just maybe we can start to get some concrete answers that can help myself and others going forward. For the next couple of weeks I’ll dive into my recovery plan and see if working on my flexibility/improving my ROM in all parts of my arm helps out at all. My forearms definitely need some work and love.

&amp;nbsp;

I hope that this long read was informative to some of you. I’ve seen tons of posts regarding swollen knuckles and I never see a follow up or hear of someone else’s experience going to a doctor, so I thought I’d share my journey with Swollen knuckles/Synovitis. I would love to hear about your experiences as well!

Here’s to healthy climbing and healthy fingers!
Survey: What's the typical personality profile of a climber? Looking for participants! We are scientists from the Ruhr-University in Bochum in Germany and currently researching how athletes from different sports and at different proficiency levels differ in their personalities.

We created a survey in which you are asked to characterize the typical athlete one meets in your sport and the ideal athlete for your sport.

The survey takes about 20 minutes and as compensation, we will later inform you about the typical personality profile of your sport!

Link to survey: https://bochumpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aUXD2hchsEOZ2N7?S=12

Feel free to share the link with other people of your/other sports!

If you have questions, leave them in the comments and we will try to answer them.

Thank you so much in advance!

P.S.: We included "climbing (outdoor)", "indoor climbing" and "bouldering" into our list. Choose what you think fits best!
Maximal hangs, Intermittent Hangs (Repeaters) or a Combination. Which 8-week program is more effective for developing grip strength in rock climbers?
Can climbharder come up with a recommended routine? If you look at some other fitness related subreddits (bodyweightfitness) for example, they have a 'recommended routine' that details a workout routine to follow, and includes lots of progressions for people who are more advanced.

Maybe collectively, this group could come up with a training plan that works.  So much training for climbing seems to be trial and error.  "Hey, try Steve Maisch's plan, try RCTM's plan, try this plan that plan", no consensus on what works best.

Add in some progressions for different levels of climbers, and then go from there.

I'm a V5 / 5.12a climber.  35 yrs old.  Training for 2 years, started climbing at 30.  I live in the midwest, and the gyms nearby are not really all that quality,  so I have had to get creative in some ways, but I'm lucky enough to live 15 minutes from some limestone bouldering, and 45 minutes from limestone sport climbing,

If I was to design a training program, I would feature these as some part of the routine:

Weighted max-hangs. - I credit these for a huge improvement in my sport climbing and bouldering.  I am able to rest on worse holds, and feel more confident with every hold.

Limit bouldering - Helped learning how to pull hard, keep core engaged during difficult movement, and helps my sport-climbing by knowing that a sequence can be figured out and perfected just like a boulder problem.

Deadlifts - I had a strong upper back / biceps from doing a trillion pullups, but I had weak hamstrings and lower back.  Learning this movement definitely helped me with overhung routes / roofs.  I have not continued deadlifting regularly (probably to my detriment), but I believe that the gains from learning the movement and how to engage the muscles remain.

Climbing outdoors and enjoying it.  Projecting routes, learning to read routes - learning about a route, and that even if I fail on a route, to take something away and internalize it, to improve on the route or boulder on the next go.

Staying injury free.  Learning when to rest.


Here are some other things that I feel helped me slightly less:

Ring workouts - additional strength work: focusing on engaging core during each exercise - pullups / pushups / dips / front lever progressions.  
I have not had shoulder issues since I started doing ring workouts; I stopped doing the other trivial rotator cuff maintenance exercises, and I credit this partially to the muscle stabilizers that rings engage.



I have tried RCTM, and repeaters, it helped, but I don't feel that the strict periodization is for me. 
 I also haven't put any effort into campusing as the gyms nearby do not have a campus board.

 Interested to hear others' thoughts.
What do you usually do "wrong" when you have a bad climbing day? Eaten too much, eaten too little? Rested too much, rested too little? Didn't have enough coffee did you? Mental game sucked and you kept comparing yourself to others?
Which mistakes do you happen to make?
Feel like my progress has really plateaued I have been climbing for about a year now and I was making great progress with V0 to V1 and V1 to V2, but I feel like the difficulty has really spiked between V2 and V3. I find myself struggling for much longer on these problems, at to date I have only ever completed two of the dozens I've worked on over the past few months.

Any advice on how to deal with this plateau in my progress? I'm trying to keep up my confidence, but I keep having those thoughts that I'm never gonna be a V3+ climber. 

Note: I work at my college's climbing wall
Tips on dynamic moves Dynamic moves sometimes render me a little useless. 

Started off climbing about a year and a half ago, as an extremely weak lady with little athletic history before it. Because I instantly fell in love with bouldering I progressed quite quickly to a point where I now comfortably do V4, V5/6 however is leaving me a little stumped. 

Although my strength is slowly progressing as I’m adding push and pull ups, and core excersices to my routine, dynamic moves can shut my brain down sometimes. Because of the little strength I had when I started, I did things as smart and static as I could, but I’ve come to a point where that isn’t enough anymore, as lots of things are now out of reach for me in static moves. 

I’m getting a little more comfortable with smaller dynamic moves, but the bigger ones just shut my brain down. My hands don’t move as I want or need them to, sometimes not even moving at all. I’m guessing it’s a sort of fear or distrust in myself but I don’t know how to surpass it. 

Please hit me with your best tips and ideas to get over this!
The "This is what I'm good at and this is what I'm bad at" thread Hi Guys! So I was thinking it might be an interesting exercise for myself (and everyone else who wants to participate) to write down all the things I'm good at in rock climbing and all the things I'm bad at in rock climbing, in order to figure out how to best improve. Obviously, self-evaluation has flaws, but if you struggle with something and you're not sure of the root cause of the issue just say what you struggle with and maybe others can help you figure it out. Each person can comment with their list, and then others can reply to them with suggestions on how to improve. I'll start with a comment below.
Are there any tips or techniques that aren't that well known? Yesterday when I was climbing, someone told me that if I extend my leg, I can put more force on my toe. Is there anything else like this that I should know? I especially have problems with sitting on my heel and other things like this. Haha tahnks :d
How much non-English-language training literature are we missing? Japan has been crushing international comps lately, and I've only seen one article (from Climbing Magazine a while back, written more as a travelogue than as a training analysis) attempting to explain why that is. So I plugged "bouldering technique" into Google Translate to get ボルダリング技術, ran that through Google, found a bunch of sites, and tried to figure out if there was anything interesting in the auto-translations. This one actually had a pretty good primer on basic technique:
http://www.camp-outdoor.com/bouldering/techniques.shtml
If you don't mind wading through translation weirdness, there's some good distillation in there. Obviously this isn't the best way to find technique and training notes, but it made me wonder: has anyone here found noteworthy training material (videos, books, articles) in other languages that we would've missed? Is there an equivalent series to the Neil Gresham videos out there in Catalan, or Japanese, or Korean, or something else that wouldn't have popped up on an American climber's default radar due to it being essentially unsearchable without some extra effort?
On those lesser (?), non-acute (?) pulley injuries Hey folks,

In my 4+ years of climbing, there is one finger injury that keeps popping up from time to time (on various fingers). In the title I call it non-acute because it just sort of shows up and lingers, then improves or gets worse depending on my climbing. There's never been a pop or anything, it feels like it's perhaps more overuse rather than one specific bad movement.

I also called it lesser because I can only remember one time where I really stopped climbing. The discomfort or mild pain is very noticeable on smaller holds or where a somewhat sharp part is pushing into the finger at that spot. I can trigger it by pushing into the bottom of my finger like [this image](https://imgur.com/a/TswY5) shows.

I recently looked up some info on injuries and from what I can tell this would probably be the A4 pulley. The table listing severeness and what to do told me that I didn't need to immobilize and I could keep climbing, but this has been going on for well over a month and it's not really improving.

How do you deal with this? Do you continue to climb? Do you change WHAT you climb? Should I rest, and how long? Specific exercises? What if none of that helps, what are my next steps?

Much appreciated!
Beginner laybacker, first time in Yosemite — Criticize my technique? Foot placement, how far should my body be from the wall, did I lean too far to the right, and anything else? Also, my lower back rounds— is it hamstring flexibility? Thanks in advance, climbharder community!
Mental transition from bouldering mindset to sport climbing mindset Hi all,

This will be my first season as a serious sport climber. I've spent most of my (short) climbing career as a boulderer. What are the biggest difference mentally between the two disciplines? How do you get yourself ready for sport climbing? Any tips or tricks? I know how to physically prepare, but mentally it's a big unknown for me. Thanks!
how do you maintain an active core while climbing i think this is a weak point of my climbing as i often find myself 'sagging' and thus being less efficient in terms of power transfer and weight distribution( and to clarify this is something im working on besides climbing as well...). so i'm wondering how people maintain an active core while climbing. do you actually think about it or does it come naturally? do you brace or hollow? whats the relationship between your breathing and your core... im looking particularly foward to hearing from people who have had problems of core activation that they were able to succesfully work on.
When is hangboarding ever a necessity for progression? There are people who never train with hangboard (like adam ondra, chris sharma) that are able to climb 9a+ and others like alex megos and dan beall who train with it and are able to climb very high grades.

Assuming you have the time to climb as much as you want and can, why would you spend time hangboarding as opposed to just climbing crimpy routes?

If we need to hangboard for progression, what about ondra and sharma?

Is it just personal preference?

I understand hangboarding will help me develop finger strength slowly over the course of many years, but wouldnt l achieve the same with climbing crimpy routes?
Finally broken through the plateau, thanks guys. Firstly, thanks guys, I found this subreddit a few months back as I had an upcoming Font trip and I wanted it to be good one, and I was fed up of being stuck not getting any better, so at the start of this year, I set myself two goals, to climb 7C/V9 by the end of the year, and to climb at least one 7A/V6 per day in Font.

I've been climbing for 7 years on and off, did 7A/V6 in my first year, 7A+/V7 in the second and 7B/V8 in the third, it was all going so well but that's where I stuck until the start of this year. I think complete lack of training and not getting outside were the major factors, I had just hit a plateau, it turned out 7B/V8 is what i was capable of climbing three times a week with no training.

So, after a lot of lurking, I decided to get training and dieting, I drew up a training schedule and got to work. I've always been a snack and beer fiend, so they were the first things to go, I managed to go from 160lbs on at the start of Jan to 145lbs just before my holiday. I also put the Beastmaker 1000 on the wall and started using it three times a week, as well as training on the moon board when I went to the wall instead of messing about on the normal problems. This sub kept me motivated on my goals, and although it's only April, I have achieved both goals, I managed my first 7C/V9 at the start of March, and on my recent Font trip, in 5 days, I managed 11 7A/V6's, 2 7A+/V7's and one 7B+/V8. 

So after all that, Just a big thanks really guys (and girls), I have contributed nothing to this sub as I really didn't know what I was doing (I'm still not sure), but it was a great help, and it has both helped me achieve my goals, but also reignite my psyche for a sport I was starting to lose it in. I'm back loving climbing and also sticking to the diet and training and working towards my lifelong goal of 8A/V11.
The Boulder: A Philosophy for Bouldering - by: Francis Sanzaro I just finished up this book, as I saw it recommended in the depths of this sub.  Recently I have found that power and finger strength is far from my limiter on rock.  Movement is what is currently holding me back, big time.  Training is so hot right now.  So much minutiae to dig through with programs (periodized/non-periodized), programming (supplementals/sets/reps/weights), acronyms (ARC, 1RM, OAP, MRP, etc.), fingerboarding (max hangs/repeaters), technique drills.  The pure climbing movement is often second fiddle in the discussion.  It makes sense though, as it is harder to discuss than training.  This book covered a lot of that, and showed me that I have a ton to learn about climbing and execution of technique.

I only highlighted moments from the chapters specifically on movement, as the book has too many noteworthy discussion points to fit in a single post.

&gt; Chapter 7 - Movement pt. 1 

* Revolutions in bouldering movement often come in the form of figures.  We are taught to move because we saw other bodies move that way.

* To abide by the *morpho* argument (that certain climbs can only be done by certain body types), sells the body short.  Difference lies in movement (to get from one hold to the next), not the body.

* Dance has the step, and it can be argued that the entirety of dance (the leap, pirouette, etc.) is but a variation of the step.  To begin, we start here statically and do a variation of the step.  The same can be said about climbing, that all our movement is a variation of the pull-down movement: arms up, palms out, grip, pull down.

[Pause for the Dave Graham wizardry video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2bZsFZdpgs)

&gt; Chapter 8 - Movement pt. 2 

* Gravity is manifested in the resistance we feel on the holds.

* From where does movement come from? It is typical in dance theory to suppose gravity is the only force acting upon the body.  [...] not entirely correct.  As soon as movement commences one must account for all the body's limbs to account for the multiplicity of forces.

&gt; Fragmented movement

* The lock off: movement feels isolated in one limb, so we can bring up the other hand more easily.

&gt; Velocity movements 

* Compensate for a lack of strength.

&gt; Dimensional moves

* Depending on the plane of the surface you are moving across, you will have a shallower plane (slab) or will use your limbs to add dimensions to the climb to increase stability in your body through sequences (laybacks, stemming, and drop knees).

&gt; **Tension** 

* The bouldering body is a rope with the ability to push and pull in both directions.  We are not so much pulled as much as we are trying to stay *closed*.

* Losing tension does not necessarily mean a lack of awareness, but often it means misplaced awareness.

&gt; Compression

* Compression moves are strategic in that they always anticipate.  

&gt; Opposition and extension moves

* The force of opposition movement does stop at the body's length.  One can not push farther than they can reach.

* Mike Tyson once remarked that when he went to punch an opponent, he looked to punch through his face.  The body in climbing needs this 'extended vision' for maximum strength.
Using Blood Flow Restriction Training To Improve Forearm Capacity https://theclimbingdoctor.com/more-for-less-what-every-climber-wants/

Just came across this (not mine). Opinions?
Bouldering grade VS Sport Grade (and what to expect) Stumbled across this article and found it quite useful/interesting as I'm a sport climber who basically uses bouldering as a tool to get stronger. I'd like to hear people's thoughts on whether they agree with the conclusions and generalizations made at the end of the article in the "A few observations" section in particular. Do you agree that having a V6 bouldering ability is sufficient to start working - any - 5.12 for example? Do you agree with the articles conclusions or do you have personal experiences that suggest otherwise? 

http://peripheralscrutiny.blogspot.com/2011/06/landscape-new-look-at-route-grades.html

Personally, I think this article is spot-on with their assessments of bouldering difficulty you'd expect to see in a given sport route (for the 5.12 and below as that's what I'm familiar with). I think it's very helpful to know how much you need to increase your bouldering ability to sport climb at a certain level (obviously it varies route to route)!
30 Minute Shoulder Strength/Stability Workout Hey all,

I just uploaded Episode 6 of "Hang With Me". I am posting here because it is relevant climbing training and I would like some feedback from the r/climbharder community on how to make the episodes more complete/enjoyable/digestible. 

What are your thoughts? Do you think this kind of video is useful? I think some of the exercises are interesting and helpful. So even if people take one or two away from the video, that's a win in my opinion.

The link to the video is here: https://youtu.be/Yq56ZoPL-no

Thanks for all of the help and support!
A while back I posted what I thought was a good climb, but got roasted by you guys. I have tried going back to easier climbs to refine my technique. Can you guys point out any errors or mistakes I have made? It felt clean to me, but so did my last post and apparently it wasn't.
Workout revelation about try hard In my journal after the last couple sessions, I noticed a theme: remember, the goal of x workout is to try hard.

After a review it hit me, the thing I’m trying to improve the most, is my ability to try hard in a given situation. Limit Boulder, try hard for one impossible move. PE, try hard for one minute of pretty hard moves. Endurance, try hard to move efficiently for a long long time.  

Yes, it is important to improve muscle and biology, but more important than that is the mental side of it. If I can focus on that, my climbing will improve much more than if I just run my workouts over and over. 

What are y’all’s thoughts on this?
English podcast with Alex Megos and Patrick Matros talking about training, Olympics and many more. (Interview starts at 8:20)
Can anyone explain physically (ie specifically to the forearms via the fingers/leverage/whatever) what is happening when training on a smaller hangboard edge vs. a deeper one? I'm trying to understand something:  

When hangboarding, hanging (half crimp position) on a 1/2" edge is significantly harder than hanging on a 1" edge, but exactly how?  You don't feel the impact of the smaller hold in your fingers, you feel it directly in your forearms, so there must be some system of leverage being transferred to your forearms.  I'm really hoping to understand this difference on a physical (forearms) + physics (leverage?) level, but I'm struggling to grasp it other than the intuitive "smaller is harder."

Thanks!
Thoughts on climbing hard and its effect on aging joints? I wonder sometimes what the verdict is on how hard climbing affects your joints in the long term (mainly hands and shoulders).  Obviously being in good shape has net positive benefits on you as you age, but I wonder how much climbing takes our body beyond just normal physical fitness and is detrimental to our joints in the long term.  I imagine this is more pronounced in people that don't practice self care and don't adequately cross train or do physical therapy related exercises.  Are joint issues inevitable down the line or are we actually doing ourselves more of a favor?
[Review] Chris Webb Parsons 12-Week Hangboard Program **Background**

I just completed the full [CWP hangboard program](https://vimeo.com/61430224) and wanted to share my experiences/results. There are basically no reviews online of the full program without adjustments, so I thought it'd be a useful resource for anyone that's interested in trying it out. For those who haven't heard of it, the 12-week program consists of half crimp one-arm hangs assisted by your other hand on a sling. You do 3 hangs on each hand for 3 arm angles (straight, 120 degrees, above 90 degrees) for a total of 9 hangs per hand. The hang times are either 10s or 5s, depending on which week of the program you're on. It's a bit convoluted even with the video, but [this table](https://simonrawlinsonphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hangboardprogram_rev1.jpg) is a pretty good summary. Below is a bit of a long write-up, so feel free to just scan.

&amp;nbsp;

**My Methods**

I tried to stay as true as possible to what is laid out in the video. I used the 22m edge on the Tension Grindstone Pro hangboard (bottom-middle edge) with an 18mm nylon runner for assistance. I chose this size edge because I could just about one arm hang it for a bit more than 1s. For the most part I hung with a neutral grip on all my hangs. I experimented one week with a pronated grip to be more climbing specific, but it ended up feeling injury-prone at lower arm angles, so I switched back. Because I had the board at home, I did my sessions 2x per week in the morning &gt;4hrs before my climbing or strength training session later in the day. I did include the letting go of assistance at the end of each hang.

&amp;nbsp;

**Results**

Both measurements are 10s two-arm hangs on 18mm

* Baseline Max: +85lbs @ 170lbs BW (150% BW hung)

* Post Program Max: +105lbs @ 173lbs BW (~160% BW hung)

&amp;nbsp; 

**Discussion/Comments**

* In retrospect, I wasn't ready for the intensity of this program. In his video CWP says the only requirement is being able to hang with one arm on your chosen edge for about 1.5s, but I think that's subject to a lot of error. For the first 2-3 weeks, I struggled to not hang most of my weight on the assisting hand. My fingers felt just strong enough, but my shoulders were giving out immediately. In addition to being able to hang the chosen edge for 1.5s, I'd add that you need to be able to hang on a jug with one hand while also rotating freely left and right comfortably. Supplementary scapular pullups with both one and two arms were immensely helpful.

* Though I'm certain my fingers got stronger, my increased max hang could also be a result of stronger shoulders. It's amazing how much easier hangs feel when your shoulders are stable. 

* I had to use a lot of total body tension (irradiation) to hang stably. Doing this 18 times per session was exhausting, both physically and mentally. Definitely built up fatigue. 

* 10s hangs felt a bit too long. Near the end of the 12 weeks, I could almost let go of the sling entirely during my 5s hangs, but after 5s I lost a lot of my max strength output. Larger muscles like shoulders and back also gave out really quickly on days where I had to do 10s hangs, especially since you're locking off multiple times in a session. 5-7s felt ideal for max strength, but 10s hangs could be useful in other ways.

* The weekly hang times/TUT felt haphazard. I think the idea is that all the 10s hangs in the first 6 weeks build up strength and the 5s hangs in the last 6 weeks allow you to recruit that strength quickly, but I'm just grasping at straws.

* While the program's merit as optimal finger strength training is debatable, I subjectively feel stronger on the wall now. The combination of increased finger strength and shoulder stability made the link from my fingers to shoulders feel bulletproof. When I latch holds now, I feel like my shoulders are in a position of power rather than just dangling.

* Letting go of the assistance at the end of every hang is interesting. I don't like the idea of continually shock loading my fingers at such high intensity, but it didn't actually end up hurting me at all. His explanation that it "ensures you're maximally stressing your fingers" isn't reassuring. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion**

I increased my 18mm 10s max hang by 20lbs, which translates to approximately +10% more of my BW that I can hang on my fingers. I like the assisted one-arm hangs, the full program not so much. I'm planning on doing one-arm hangs again later, but would probably fiddle around with 5-7s hangs rather than 10s. I'm a bit skeptical as to whether one-arm hangs are better than or even on par with weighted two-arm hangs for pure finger strength training, but I'm a big fan of the shoulder stability aspect of one-arm hangs. Imo, the program needs stricter prerequisites to avoid injury.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR It works(?). I added 20lbs to my standard 18mm hangs and feel stronger overall. I would practice caution when starting the program if you've never done one-arm hangs. Start slow. Make sure your shoulders are strong enough.**
'Dropping the weight' equivalent for climbing? Inspired by Peter Attia on Joe Rogan Podcast. Hi all, listened to a recent Joe Rogan podcast where Peter Attia was the guest. He has a performance sports and medical background, so was really fascinating to listen to as he covered all kinds of subjects. Something that came up around the 1hr30min mark was another guy called Ryan Flaherty - who is a 'speed coach' for professional athletes. Ryan had apparently come up with a metric where you measure 'force plate impact' / weight and the resulting ratio has a very direct correlation to 100m sprinting. Usain Bolt is given as an example having the highest ratio ever recorded.

So, having observed the correlation, he wanted to see if you could train it. The aim is to be strong and light - very similar to climbing. He came up with an exercise regime using hex bar dead lifts, lifting very close to maximum weight. Then dropping the bar. Doing a low number of reps. The science being that the muscle fibres are not damaged as much because you do not do the negative part of the movement where fibres would usually tear. So you gain strength without bulking so much.

Listen here for the direct version, at 1he30min:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP1NA5f4LfE

Anyway, after that long introduction... I'm wondering how this would translate in to the world of rock climbing. Best idea i could come up with would be weighted pull ups (need to weight accordingly so you can only do 5 reps maximum), but then you drop to the floor rather than lowering down. I can see issues with this as it could add to the already hard to avoid imbalances from doing a 'pulling' focused sport. But ignoring those potential worries what do people think about this idea?

It isn't something I've seen applied to rock climbing before. The nearest alternative is max hangs / weighted max hangs. But these are a more static engagement of the muscles, not pulling then dropping.

EDIT: I agree that dropping from a pull up bar is going to be problematic, dangerous and not good for knees/backs etc.

But i was excited to try and apply the method of training that has been embraced by elite runners/cyclists etc to our sport.

Campusing has been suggested but i think the ability to scientifically add weight up to very close to maximum loads is the key to the process created by Ryan Flaherty.

I mentioned in a comment about a gym machine like:

http://www.mystrengthtraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Lat-pull-down-machine2.png

I'm bad with gym terminology but that is apparently a 'lat pulldown'. If there was a version that dropped the weights carefully, rather than crashing down it could be a possibility?
Nutrition Practices People Actually Follow If you just google climbing/boulder+nutrition, you get a lot of articles such as:
http://useful.coach/articles/carbohydrate-climbing-performance/
http://www.climbingnutrition.com/
http://rockandice.com/rock-climbing-training/nutrition-eating-your-way-to-better-climbing/

plus all the Training Beta, Keto debates, the "how much protein do I need?" articles, etc.

Lots of citations and sound reasoning, but over the past year I've seen almost zero of this in practice locally it seems. In particular I rarely see anyone consume anything during even long sessions, most fairly strong climbers I've met seem to do fuck all with their diet other than weighing themselves and eating more/less, and outdoors things seem to go out the window entirely.

Other than people who need to eek out the last few % of bodyfat I begin to wonder if any of these guidelines essentially matter?  It is pretty easy to understand what energy systems climbing uses, but looking at actual climbing workouts the muscles fatigued the most and in the most direct manner are often small. You use other parts of your body besides your forearms, but not directly targeted or exhausted the same as if you were weightlifting (sets of deadlifts are more direct than say climbing a few different overhang problems that use the back, glutes, and legs to different degrees).  Do people legitimately notice anything from eating during workouts in a gym like the articles above mentioned, eating bro level amounts of protein, or really having much of a "strategy"?

I ask because after a few frustrating quests with various low carb, higher protein, etc. strategies and nothing seems to have made much of a positive difference, if anything probably an annoyance or negative difference. 

**EDIT:  My question is not does eating healthy or being mindful matter, but at what level do incrementally convoluted strategies become necessary or yield greater results? No one can dispute that eating fast food vs. healthy alternatives calorie-for-calorie is the same, but beyond basic practices when do more complex strategies and choices really become a requirement?**
Usefulness of pro climber clinics A pro climber is coming to our gym this weekend and having a 2-hour clinic with a small group of signed up climbers.  It'll cost about $85, and I'm wondering whether it's worth it to shell out the cash for a 2-hour clinic.  Have any of you guys ever gone to a similar thing and can you describe your experience?
Lets talk about crack technique So, I've been working on a new project involving many different sizes of cracks (mostly tips to ringlocks), which has been making me think about the crack technique I've learned over the years, and the newer stuff I'm learning. The idea of this post is to share the little tricks we've all learned for crack climbing, as it has a lot more to do with technique than strength.

Beyond basic hand and foot jamming, these articles helped me early on in my climbing career:

[Wide hands](https://www.climbing.com/skills/tech-tip-trad-wide-hands-crack-technique/)

[Thin stuff](http://www.lackhead.org/jamming/)

Although it's been linked before in this sub there's the [Wild Country Crack School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W99gN54wLQ)

Also,[ remember this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSl3kSU76ys)?

Recently, a friend introduced me to a technique I call the "fat finger" for rattly finger terrain. It's similar to a ringlock. You insert your index finger, middle finger, and thumb into the crack, and then curl your index finger above your thumb. Press the inside of your thumb joint into the index finger nail hard. This makes the flesh around the second knuckle "fat" and chocks it into the crack. With my middle finger I'm also curling it around the index from above. This jam works best from full arm extension to eye level.

Also, with the thin cracks I've been working on shoe choice has been important. Something with a thin toe that I can sneak the edge in and twist has been real helpful.

**Other things I've found useful:**

Some jams only work at a certain range, either "high to eyes" or "eyes to chest." Even wide stuff like chicken wings have a specific range where they work best.

Shitty jams work better sometimes when you lean one way or the other in a straight-in crack, particularly stuff like insecure fists and cupped hands.

If your feet are slipping while laybacking, consciously tighten your core.

When pulling over the lip of a roof, sometimes smearing on the lip is better than trying to get a foot jam. 

Grades for crack climbs are super body specific. If you're not average-male size, they're going to feel a lot different. Some ladies can hand jam through #.75 cracks. Some dudes can fist jam large #4 cracks.

Sneaking a pinky toe into a crack while laybacking can make it a lot more secure, even if it's steep.

Inverting in an offwidth is weird black magic shit, but it works. Use stiff shoes.


**What little nuances of technique have been helpful for you?**
What is one non-climbing exercise that you were convinced would be good for climbing that turned out to be useless and vice versa (one non-climbing exercise that you were convinced was bad turned out to be useful or super useful)? could be more than one; otherwise, title
Exercises to hit things that don't get trained by just climbing I was wondering if people had any good ideas for exercises that hit key areas that don't get trained well by just climbing a bunch. For example, I've found ab exercises have made a big difference in my climbing. Or perhaps another more general question, what do people think are the most important exercises to do as a climber aside from climbing a bunch?
Drills I thought this was a great video talking about a few common drills. I typically include the sticky quiet feet in my warm-up, as well as sticky hands. What other drills do you use to practice skills for climbing? The point of this post for me is to compile a list of as many different drills/practice ideas in one spot.

Also a few more older things that can add to this list.

How to keep morale high during injury? Long story short, 2 days ago I had a freak accident on my mountain bike which left me with a few stitches in my arm, a deep muscle bruise in my thigh and worst of all, potentially a partially torn rotator cuff or labrum. I was at the best climbing level I've ever been at before, so now I'm super bummed.

What would you recommend to keep the morale high? What can I do to maintain fitness with a bad shoulder?
Preventing and treating tendon pulley soreness I have a chronic problem with tendon pulley soreness and I'm not sure exactly how to fix it permanently.  I just have a few questions.  

Should I wait until the pain is completely gone before I start climbing again?  What I mean is the pain in my finger (L ring right now) is pretty much gone but when I clench a fist as hard as I can there is very mild pain distal to the second knuckle.  Should I wait for that to completely go away?  Or are there exercises I can do while still not putting too much strain on the finger.  Currently I'm doing easy problems, no left hand crimps, and no hangboard.

Second, like I said this is not the first time this has happened to me.  I've never had a major finger injury that resulted in swelling or severe pain but I've had mild soreness that progressively gets worse if I continue climbing.  What should I be doing to prevent tendon soreness?  I've tried finger taping but I really haven't noticed that it's done anything.

Thanks in advance for the advice.
Once stiff climbers who are now flexible, how'd you do it? I've really been enjoying these 'what worked for me' threads. Have seen ones on general technique, strength, but haven't seen on on climber flexibility \(apologies if I missed it\).

Recently I've realized that hip flexibility is really holding me back \(literally by having a few strong boulderers say "your hip flexibility is really holding you back"\). Specifically glute, hamstring, and hip opening. So I've been working on it. Pigeon progressions, frog pose and a few others, combined with dead lifts are helping but I have a long way to go. Comparing my beta to more limber climbers is humbling.

So what worked for you?
routesetting hey all. i just got a gig routesetting once a week at a small bouldering-only gym.

i’m a damn serious climber. i want to grow as a climber whilst working. any suggestions on how to maximize my learning of movement while setting?

any of you who have set part-time in the past, what was your experience?

i hear setting is hard on the body. i hope one day a week (bouldering only) will be safe.

edit: thank you SO much everyone. there is valuable advice here. ill read everything and respond to comments where i have further thoughts/questions. peace!
Climbing Training: Core Strength (Part 1)! Hey all,

I just uploaded part 1 of my core strength routine on my channel, Hang with Me. I am posting here because it is relevant climbing training and I would like some more feedback from the r/climbharder community.

I generally find core routines relevant to climbing difficult to find, narrow, and appropriately select, so I wanted to contribute to the community! What are your thoughts?

The link to the video is here: https://youtu.be/1rqnS_s9XMk

Thanks for all of the help and support!
I've recently been having a harder time recovering after a climbing day. What changed? I've been climbing for 17 months now, and up until now my routine has been to "just climb" 3x a week. I try to get on every problem I can do in a session or two (almost never more than a week unless it's very cool) in my gym, both in my strengths and weaknesses. Last fall, I was able to get outside every week, but seasonal asthma means I can't go out during spring.

Recently (like 6 weeks or so), I've noticed that I didn't seem to be recovering as well. Let's say I climb Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Monday's session would be fine, but then on Wednesday I would still feel sore from Monday. Specifically it feels like my forearms haven't recovered. If I went Thursday instead of Wednesdays, then it would be ok. I'm confused as to why it seems like I suddenly need 2 days of rest instead of 1. 

The most natural answer I thought of was that since I could climb harder, I was stressing my body more and so it was going to take longer to recover. But this doesn't really make sense to me since it seems like my forearm muscles are the part not recovering. I weight trained a lot for ultimate frisbee (previous sport I did), and even after multiple years and getting up to 2x BW squats, I could still squat 3x a week. Is climbing different?

So anyways, I have a few more specific questions besides, "what's going on?!!"

Does the amount of rest you take during a climbing session affect how well you recover afterwards? It's possible I've changed how I've been resting between attempts. I understand that not resting enough will make my next attempt worse (obviously) but does it have longer term recovery effects?

Could this possibly be a nutrition problem? Nothing about my diet has changed in quite a few years, but maybe I was making poor diet choices the whole time. I tend to eat 2 bigger meals with some bars if I'm climbing that day. One of the meals is your standard balanced meal (grain, vegetables, meat) and the other is the same but with more protein and no grain. Do I need to up my carb intake? I sleep 9-10 hours a day including naps so I doubt that's the issue.

Am I not doing the right thing on off days? The only exercise I do on off days is biking to/from work and yoga. Should I actually be trying to lightly stimulate my recovering forearms a little?

And then the last thing is, maybe this is what's supposed to happen. In which case, is it time to stop "just climbing" and start dedicating days to specific things? Like Monday project, Weds 4x4 etc. Or those rotating training programs?

I don't know what other information would be helpful but can provide whatever else. Thanks!
So, what exactly are the reasons the Japanese team excels? What are they doing right? Ideas have been tossed around in the comments section (ex. they just log hours and hours of climbing on different holds/wall angles daily or emphasizing flexibility training) but I haven't found much else. Any theories?
[Discussion &amp; Analysis] The Ingredients of Climbing # An Extended Metaphor

Climbing is a book full of recipes, where each recipe contains a set amount of each ingredient. While not every ingredient is required for each recipe, all will be required at some point within the cookbook. Perfecting the amount, order, and timing of each ingredient is crucial to the quality and success of any given recipe.

The chef's goal is to master each recipe such that the execution becomes instinctual for all recipes. The chef deliberately practices every facet of each recipe and becomes intimately familiar with the nuances of every ingredient such that the applications become intuitive, and allows for creative usage for the purposes of inventing new recipes and optimizing existing ones.

# What are the Ingredients?

I count six ingredients:

* **Technique**
* **Muscle Strength**
* **Mobility**
* **Connective Tissue Durability**
* **Intelligence**
* **Mentality**

Let's dive into how each ingredient plays a crucial role for *every* climber, and briefly cover the synergistic interactions between ingredients.

# Technique

Technique is the refining of movement on the wall such that a climber remains in balance. The basis of technique is [proprioception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception). Without proprioception, the next four ingredients fail to matter.

In terms of practical application, proprioception refers to a climber's knowledge of where one's center of mass is on the wall, and the deliberate manipulation of it. Famous climbing analyst and author Udo Neuomann shared another perspective of the same idea, coining the term "crossing the midline" in his [excellent analysis of Akiyo Noguchi's climbing](https://youtu.be/NS7ZdBS-jW0?t=5m57s).

All manipulation of center of mass requires movement and the ability to hold a balanced position, which in turn requires **muscle strength**. To have more manipulations available, **mobility** is required. To perform manipulations safely requires **connective tissue durability**. To perform the correct manipulations successfully requires **intelligence**.

# Muscle Strength

Muscle strength refers to the peak force a muscle can generate, the rate which peak force can be reached, and the length of time a force can be maintained.

On the wall, muscle strength determines the hold dimensions and distance separating holds such that the holds are theoretically usable with the right amount of other ingredients.

Some muscles are used more than others, which creates [muscle imbalances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_imbalance). This prioritization makes it necessary for all climbers to perform additional strength work off the wall for the purposes of muscular stabilization. Balanced muscular strength will allow a climber to utilize movements on the wall without allowing for muscular overcompensation, which could lead to injury.

The development of muscle strength off the wall becomes necessary for every climber at a higher level. To do so safely both maintains and requires **connective tissue durability** and **mobility**.

# Mobility

Mobility refers to the passive and active range of motion of a climber's muscles. On the wall, greater mobility allows for more potential ways of finding and holding a balanced position.

Because climbing prioritizes some muscles over others in an agonist\-antagonist pair, muscle tightness can develop, restricting range of motion of muscles and joints. Therefore **it is essential for all climbers to perform mobility work** for the "climbing muscles", such as the lats, core muscles, scapular stabilizers, forearm flexors and extensors, hamstrings, and quads.

A consistent mobility routine maintains **connective tissue durability** and improves **technique**, provided **intelligence** is developed.

# Connective Tissue Durability

Connective tissue durability allows a climber to improve one's efficacy with every other ingredient by allowing one to stay injury\-free.

As previously mentioned, connective tissue durability can be compromised by the wrong amounts of muscle strength and mobility. It is therefore imperative to look at these three ingredients as one unit where compromise of one sabotages all three.

On top of the benefits already listed through remaining injury\-free, **connective tissue durability** allows for a climber to make mistakes on the wall and explore a potential** techniqu**e without causing injury, which in turn improves a climber's** mentalit**y by instilling confidence and the ability to try hard.

# Intelligence

Intelligence is the ability to make adaptations mid\-route and in between attempts, and the ability to create a feasible sequence for oneself prior to attempting a problem, plus backups. Off the wall, intelligence allows for effective design of a training plan catered to oneself in both the short and long term.

There is no known skill cap for intelligence, and thus can always be an area to improve. Intelligence is correlated with technique, but is not causal.

Additionally, **intelligence** acts as a stimulant for **technique**, and as a sanity check for **muscle strength** and **mobility**. This can help out a climber's **mentality** under different situations, such as projecting or onsighting.

# Mentality

Mentality is an ingredient that is often underutilized. Its applications include instilling confidence, positivity, respect for oneself and the crag, objectivity, and emotion after a send, to name a few. Mentality allows for development of belaytionships and training partners, and recruits competent spotters. A well\-developed mentality allows for a climber to enjoy the act of climbing.

Mentality acts as a filter for clear\-mindedness when assessing each ingredient. An example would be accepting a proper training plan for **muscle strength** instead of focusing on muscle size or weight loss. Further, [stress has been shown to have a negative effect](http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/stress-body.aspx) on the musculoskeletal system, which includes **muscles** and **connective tissues**.

# Skill Versus Strength

With much debate in recent times over climbing being primarily a skill sport or primarily a strength sport, I'm going to divide the essential ingredients into each category and count.

# Skills

* **Technique**
* **Intelligence**
* **Mentality**

# Strengths

* **Muscle Strength**
* **Mobility**
* **Connective Tissue Durability**

As each ingredient is essential throughout a climber's career, I give each ingredient equal weighting. **Therefore, I come to the conclusion that climbing is equal parts strength and equal parts skill**. Not that the skill versus strength debate matters either way, because having enough of each ingredient is what matters when it comes to increasing one's climbing cookbook.

# In Conclusion

The above is simply my thoughts on consistent themes of successful climbers and through anecdotal experience. What makes a climber "good" on a personal level is something I think is open to interpretation—for me, I want to be a good climber in the sense of hard grades and consistency at a high level.

I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts of my list of ingredients, what you would add or remove, what your personal lists would be, your own thought processes on climbing, and views on the importance of strength versus skill! Did you find this useful, or did I miss the mark?

Additionally, how do these ingredients change when focusing on a particular type of climbing, such as alpinism or traditional climbing? I'm interested in hearing opinions from those with more \(any\) experience with those and other disciplines outside of sport climbing and bouldering. Does the value of any of the ingredients shift? Let me know!
Please critique my current training plan! (If you're into that kinda' thing) Hey, Climbharder! I just wanted to run by my current training plan by the masses before the #summertimetrainingshenanigans really start up.

First things first, I currently climb 13a sport, v10 boulders, and easy .12 trad (all outside). My goals are to climb a v12 and a 5.14 in the next year or two.

My training plan for the next month or so is split into three days which I cycle through with two days on and one day off (on average, rest days vary)

Day one: Pure climbing
-Warm up 5 minutes jump rope, 3x20 kettle bell swings, and 20 minutes easy climbing.
-Project something hard (for me) for about 45 minutes and try to flash new boulders.
-Either do Campus Punks or circuit every v7,8.9 (roughly 3-4 of each) in my gym.
-Cool down with active mobility, jump rope, and some foam roll and theraband.

OR

Day two: Fingers and Endurance
-Warm up (same as above)
-Climb for about 30 minutes focusing on technique and dynamic flow
-Hang Board (Max Hang, small beastmaker edge). I am adding about 5 pounds every week or so until I max-out or feel like I need to step back.
-Bench Press: 3-5 sets of high weight, high rest in order to build power and oppositiional/compression strength.

OR

Day Three: Contact Strength and Power
-Warm Up (same as above)
-Climb around for about 30 minutes focusing on technique. (Usually footwork and twisting/being static)
-Campus Board: I mix up the exercises I do, but generally pick two or three exercises and do three sets of each one.
-Dead Lift (strict, not sumo) I am adding 5 pounds per week and am doing high weight, low rep, high rest.

After all sessions I do a few minutes of jumprope for cardio (trying to get a little fitter in general) and some static and dynamic stretching. I do Is Ys and Ts a few days per week.

As the summer ends, I will start incorporating more endurance and PE into my routine and start tapering my lifting.

Basically, I just want to see what you all think of my workout, what you all might add, and what I may be doing too much of. Thanks!!
Why do your elbows raise when you get pumped? Also feel free to share your "fight the pump" tips whether it be physical or mental
Let's talk about technique drills! There's so much talk about strength training and hangboarding, that one of the most fundamental and important thing a climber can do is often neglected, or only briefly mentioned... and that's technique practice (i.e technique drills)!

Yes, you can work endurance, power, strength, but if your technique sucks, then you're not going to be climbing anywhere near your limit compared to your actual strength. So for climbers with poor technique (i.e. pretty much everyone who just boulders indoors, or only recently started climbing), this is going to be the best bang for your buck improvement at climbing. Hell, competition climbers spend a lot of time on technique drills - just think of all those dynamic coordination moves that you need to get in at little attemps as possible, so much technique involved there.

If you do have great technique... then maybe your time would be better spent doing strength training or mental training, etc. - it's really a matter of knowing your weaknesses and your goals.

So, how to actually go about practicing technique?

Step 1. Figure out your technique weaknesses, write then down, and choose a few technique drills to focus on for the next several sessions. If you have no idea your technique weaknesses, ask someone significantly better than you to give you some feedback on your climbing, get a coach, or ask /r/climbharder/.

Step 2. White down your goals for the session before you go. I've found this crucially important. Once we write down goals we're way more likely to actually do them. I've been writing down my goals such as "practice heavy feet drill for 20 minutes", then when I get to the gym I'm way less likely to get sidelined by that shiny looking new boulder problem, or hanging out with friends.

Step 3. Practice your drills at the appropriate intensity. It's very difficult to learn new skills when working near or at your limit - you simply don't have enough mental capacity to focus on the new skills. So for learning and improving technique, start on very easy terrain. This is why the warmup is the perfect time to practice technique drills. Once you've practiced the technique a lot on easier terrain, then step it up and focus on it during medium difficulty terrain, such as power endurance type routes/problems. Finally, once it's really dialed, if you've actually mastered the skill, then you'll probably just start doing it on harder terrain without having to focus on it too much, or at all.

Which drills to practice?

There's lots of youtube videos with examples of drills to do. I really like the Power Company Climbing Movement Skills for Climbers Videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYlaFzuotoE&amp;list=PLcC3tGLuho_vp3NN-rZKxdq2z0gjhyY0Y. I've been practicing "heavy feet" a lot in the last month and have noticed a real change in my climbing style. Lots of other skills like practicing static vs. dynamic climbing, deadpoints, dynos, maintaining tension, etc.

I want to re-iterate how important it is to get technique training written down, and into your goals/schedule. It's so easy to skip it if you don't make it a high priority. Technique drills are awesome since you can fit them into every single session, or can even dedicate short sessions to technique drills.
Committed noob looking for advice Hey all-

I’m a noob climber (literally ~1 month of climbing in ~30 years of life) but I’m gettin really into it. I’m an ex-ironman triathlon, no kids, cushy job, and so I enjoy committing to mental/physical goals that challenge myself. I’ve been climbing every other day for the past month. Doing cardio/rest every other day. I have a lot of free time.

I’ve done a lot of basic reading on how to climb injury free and beginner climbing techniques. Learning fast, I’m currently flashing 5.8s, sending 5.9s and projecting 5.10- to ~10% sending.

My questions are vague because I’m new to the sport, so general feedback is also welcome: What advice do you vets have for how to use my commitment to my advantage in climbing? What stupid mistakes should I try to avoid? Thanks a bunch, looking forward to learning.
How can i climb more efficiently? I have been climbing for about a year now and now i climb about 1-2 times per week, bouldering indoors at around V2-3 level. But for the past two-three months, i don't feel myself improving and i struggle on climbs that are V4 and above. 

I get a lot of feedback to "just climb more" but i need advice on how to make the most out of 1-2 training sessions per week. Currently i just go to the gym, warm-up by stretching and climbing some V0-1s, climb all the V2-3 routes then i would feel like i have hit a limit and i would hang on fingerboards for about 15 minutes in total and do some pull-ups before going home. 

What can i do more to see improvement? Should i do more technique drills? Would a training plan help? Thank you!

Edit: Thank you everyone for the advices! I'll summarise them for tldr if anyone else are in similar situations.

1. Project routes that are out of my comfort zone, maybe V4-5 and then spend a few sessions trying it and projecting it until i can send it.
2. Try to climb more often than 2 times a week if possible.
3. Watch others climb and approach them for beta or help in general.
4. Practice technique by doing drills or training certain moves.
Back in August 2017 I had surgery to repair a 100% rupture of my left distal bicep tendon. Just wanted to thank climbharder community for providing excellent motivation and reading during my recovery. Today I managed to pull on Kudos 7B/V8 at rubicon. Peak District lime stone England
Climbing vs Life - Sacrifices and Hacks Have you left a partner because you want to climb harder?

Did you decide not to have kids so you could continue to send?

Do you work a shitty job so you can focus your energy on training?

Or do you work a serious job but spend most or all your free time on climbing related things \(nutrition, reading, training, etc\) at the expense of everything else?

Have you moved to a crappy town solely because it makes climbing easier?

Have you made serious sacrifices like these, and were they worth it, or do you regret them? How does this change with age? If you're older, looking back, were those sacrifices worth it? Is there a line where that perception shifts, or not?

Or have you found a way to balance things out? Was 'must be a serious climber' on your list when looking for a partner, and if so did that work out for you? Did you manage to shape a career that was both rewarding and flexible enough to allow you to climb hard year round? What 'life hacks' have you found useful when attempting to balance serious climbing with family, friends, work, and other goals an responsibilities?
Endurance and Power Endurance For people on the east coast, the weather is getting hot rather quickly and sport climbing is upon us. I just wanted to share some personal experience with endurance, as well as power endurance that enabled me to be a stronger climber.

**Context**: I started with a training plan at Plastic V6, Rock 5.10d and since December 2017, I've earned the fruit of hard training at Plastic V8, Rock 5.12a.  I've just recently put myself on sport and found myself onsighting 11d, whereas nearly a year ago I was redpointing 11a. 


**The Cardio of Climbing: Traverses.**
 For 3 months, among the 3 days/wk I went to the gym, 2 of those days ended with 3 sets of 10 minute traverses. At the end of those three months, they became 15 minute traverses. It may not seem like much, but during my first 10 traverse, I was so wasted that I pumped off the fattest jugs imaginable--I finished 1/3 traverses and couldnt continue. By the end, I could pump out 15 minute traverses and finish the set.

**Boulder pyramids:** Not the conventional V1-VX and down. For example, if my max were V6, the tip of my pyramid would be V5. So, here was my pyramid: V1 V2 V4 V3 V5 V4 V6 V4 V5 V3 V2. Heres the catch: Do each boulder 3 times. Your Rest Time in between attempts at a boulder as well as the rest between switching to the next is either 1:1, 1:1.5 or 1:2 compared to how long you were on the wall. Ex. Climb 20 seconds: Rest 20 seconds (1:1). I was very strict with the timing

Personal Thoughts: The point of this training is simply to push your pump threshhold. If you can climb V4, you theoretically should be able to climb 5.12-. This is because the crux of a 5.12 route should be ~V4. The major challenge is obviously the entire way UP to the crux may pump you to the point that you cannot pull V4. Therefore, adapt your muscles with the adequate stress.

I've recently tried the boulder pyramid work out, and my pyramid looks like this: V3 V4 V5 V6 V7 V6 V5 V4 V3. Similarly to in december where I had not included V0s in my pyramid, I cut out V1s and V2s because they were not challenging, even at the end of the pyramid.

When I came back to the traverses, after nearly 1.5 months of neglecting them for power training, my endurance was trash. I couldnt complete the 3 sets of 15 minutes, and instead found myself barely completing 3 sets of 10 minutes. Clearly, endurance does NOT stick around. All the more reason to be consistent, or to return to them after a week or two of neglect.

I've had a hell of a time with this workout and It has made me stronger in ways I couldn't percieve until recently. I broke through V8 plastic and V7 rock because my endurance has stepped up and I can pull my hardest for a longer period of time. I'm hoping the same abuse this workout gave me is given to you guys.
Your favorite workouts by category (endurance, strength, strength endurance, power). I would like to create a list of all workouts that we do, by category.  I think this could be useful for people creating their training program and experimenting what works from them.  

Some basic definitions:

__Endurance__:  purely aerobic.

__Strength__:  how much force you can generate.

__Strength Endurance__:  how much for you can generate for longer durations of time.

__Power__:  how quickly you can generate force, or strength x time.
How I solved the nerve pain in my hands Hey guys, 

I just wanted to contribute a little knowledge on the topic of dealing with nerve pain in the thumb/palm region and sometimes pointer and middle finger. I was having weird sensations (burning, tingling, pins and needles) in my hands that were getting really frustrating, and bothered me when I was climbing, typing, and writing. I couldn't find any good solutions online. I thought it may be something similar to carpal tunnel syndrome and I went to get physio for some answers, here's how I dealt with it for those that need to try something:

Release front AND back of the forearm with lots of pressure (from a ball or other device)
Stretch forearm, bicep, and pecs.
Perform some nerve flossing like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejGZ8OoeXWw&amp;ab_channel=FullBodyFix

The biggest thing that got rid of my pain really quickly was a one-hour massage focused solely on getting rid of this problem.

 Hopefully, this helps anyone who needs it.
Training "on the nerve" TLDR: Psyching yourself up while training may result in much longer recovery times.

Interesting excerpt from an article here. Seems to have implications for climbing insofar as we try to train the try-hard mental muscle and our performances are mentally taxing.

Training "on the nerve"

Too much training volume seems to be the main culprit, [of overtaxing] but I'll go one step further: Any training that causes mental stress will lead to a greater cortisol production. Just psyching yourself up to do a lift, or getting nervous about attempting a rep, will drastically increase the cortisol response to training.

Vassily Alexeyev (Olympic lifter with 81 world records) used to say that his secret was "never training on the nerve." This means he didn't psych himself up for any gym lift and never attempted weights that he wasn't sure of making. He understood that training is about developing the body and its capacities and not about testing your limit.

Those of you who have competed in an individual sport that tests your limit in one capacity (powerlifting, Olympic lifting, track and field, etc.) know that a competition where you produce an all-out effort will affect your training for up to 10-14 days. Many will actually have symptoms of depression during that period. Every time you train "on the nerve" you're essentially recreating the same thing (to a slightly smaller scale, but it can still be damaging and affect your training).

Training on the nerve might increase performance by only 3-5%, but it more than likely doubles the recovery time from a workout. That means you can't train as often, and frequency is much more important than volume.

You can train a lift or muscle frequently without "overtraining," and you can train it hard, but only if you avoid training on the nerve. If you're doing work that can be potentially taxing on the CNS (heavy lifting, explosive work, going to failure), one way of reducing excessive CNS demands is to focus on keeping everything from the neck up as relaxed as possible. This will prevent an excessive CNS jolt that can indeed boost your performance, but can also make you hit the wall really fast.

Tensing the face, clenching your jaw, and having your neck look ropey can increase force production and is a tool that can be used when competing or maxing out. It comes at a cost, though. Your nervous system will take a lot longer to recover and you might even end up suffering from "workout hangover" the next day.

Fast clipping for competitions Hey Guys
Next week I'll be going to my first just for fun rock climbing lead competition.
Do you have any tips, ideas or videos which focus on efficient and fast clipping?
While checking YouTube i just find the general how to and not to clip
warehouse legality Hey climb harder folks.

Im a Bay Area resident. Im frustrated with the gyms in the area. Let me make my case:

* setting leans towards big moves on positive holds. Think gymnastic climbing. commercialized.
* a lack of training facilities (few woodies, tensions boards, etc)
* lots of kids birthday parties and new folks. Less focused training.

I want to open a small, training only facility. 45 degree wall, hang boards, campus board, very simple weights.

This would be for people who simply want to train.

What I dont know anything about: zoning laws. Is it as simple as renting a 1000ft square foot warehouse (where they are open to construction) and getting started?

Sorry. I know this isn't specifically training advice. hopeful for some good tips.

train hard!

edit:

im open to receiving help. My buddies and I can build the wall etc. any lawyers or real estate folks on the bay on this sub? im psyched to make this happen. I can drive the funding, manpower, and overall psyche. I just need some hep with finding the space to make this happen.
300 days of training and bouldering for one person TLDR: \~10 months of concerted effort at only two exercises yielded me at least a full V grade indoors \(V6\-\&gt;V8\) and outdoors \(V4\-\&gt; V5\). Click on links for graphs

Here is my incredibly simple program:

* Boulder on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.
* Deadlift and max hangs on tuesday and thursday if I'm not too fatigued.
* I sometimes run and I play pickup basketball a bit. If some combination of these activities gets me feeling too tired then I just take time off.
* If my performance drops inexplicably, then I take time off.

That's it. I started doing this after a little over 2 years of "just climbing". I felt really plateaued and was having trouble figuring out things like fatigue and recovery. Just for reference I am 5'11 and 140 lbs. I'm about to turn 35 and I started climbing at 32. I feel like I'm on the road to improvement again now.

[My max hangs have progressed from nothing to \+30 lbs.](https://i.imgur.com/4bv6hyh.png)

[My deadlift from 110 lbs to 185 lbs](https://i.imgur.com/h9qcyGk.png)

[I've noticed my pace of getting V7 and higher indoor climbs going way up](https://i.imgur.com/7EmQJJP.png)

[I believe there's a strong correlation between my hangboard rests and sending harder indoor climbs.](https://i.imgur.com/OrR1CR7.png)

A lot of my data is from indoor climbing, but I've also noticed an improvement in my outdoor climbing. I've sent a few local V5s and worked some 6s.

I'm hoping to continue these efforts through the summer. The only change I'm looking at making is incorporating more open hand hangs. I tried them briefly over the winter and I'm extremely bad at them. My new goal is to climb V6 at Bishop this fall / winter.

I mainly am making this post because I'm hoping it'll help convince people that you really don't need to think very much. You just need to be consistent and not waste your energy doing reps on a variety of exercises. Maybe if you are a lot stronger than me, then this becomes important. I'm also curious what other people do to keep track of their efforts.
Breaking Into 5.13 At the Red Posted this in the Simple Questions Thread, but  was told to try a full post. Any feedback is appreciated!

Looking for advice about breaking into 5.13 at the Red this fall.

A little background:

* I'm a boulderer at heart and have climbed up to V8 outside.
* I have a decent route pyramid built up at the Red with a handful of upper 12's and good base of low\-end 12's, though I tend to gravitate towards the more bouldery routes.

Goal:

Be fit enough to climb some of the classic 13a's at the Red this fall \(September \- November\). As far as crags go, I have The Motherlode and Drive\-By in mind.

Questions:

Assuming that I'd be fine with just maintaining my current level of bouldering ability/strength, how should I plan my summer training\-wise? I know that power endurance will be very important but I also know that it's quick to come and quick to go. Is there any benefit to doing multiple power endurance cycles throughout the summer over one focused cycle at the end of summer \(September\-ish\)?
Joint Supplements I Write this because i learned a lot in this reddit and want to give you something back guys. 

I had big problems with my dip capsule in the past. It started about one year ago after a hard crimp at a boulder traverse where my foot slipped off and my middle finger where loaded lateral. afterwards i had pain and stiff fingers in the morning. So i began to tape the finger, icing it after climbing, tried to Voodoofloss it and didnt boulder for some time - but it didnt get mutch better. Every time i where doing hard routes i experienced pain afterwards.

I learned about the combination of  MSM(Methylsulfonylmethan) and glucosamin from my osteophat, googled it in the net [1] and  tried it out. Now after 3 weeks of taking it the pain and Stiffness in my fingers that i experienced for almost a year is gone. I can even hangboard at my limit again! 
So guys if you have some trouble with your joints try it out, i wish i had knew it before!


Tldr Try msm and glucosamin if you have trouble with your joints.

Kicking the wall on slab? I see people recommending people not drag their feet on the wall. Especially on slab with my high foot on a pretty weak hold, I tend to kick the wall repeatedly raising the lower leg. Is that a control issue or a common thing?
10 Mo Climbing Effect on Body Composition **Hoping that this post helps others identify that with basic, healthy eating at normal calorie ranges you can make positive changes by just climbing and having fun**

**TL;DR: If you eat well and at maintenance you can gain muscle and lose fat (albeit slowly) by just climbing.**

----

**DEXA Scan Results**
*Note: The first line was when I was racing bikes and before climbing. I am apparently 191cm, which is news to me as I thought I was 186*

Date |Weight | Bodyfat % | Muscle Mass | BMR
---|---|----|----|---
5/06/2015 | 154.5 | 10.0 | 139 | 1740
8/27/2017 | 174.7 | 14.7 | 143 | 1801
6/04/2018 | 174.2 | 13.7 | 144.6 | 2002

* **Edit:** BMR does not include activity factor. I don't really know what it is, but see calorie levels below.
* The main changes between the 2015 and 2017 result were losing 8 lbs of muscle or so from my legs. My legs have gotten slightly larger, but from swapping some muscle for bodyfat. Most of my upper body back then was fat, with extremely little mass in my trunk.
* Gained 1.6lbs of lean mass total, lost about as much fat.  Most notably I lost 2% fat in my arms, gained .8lbs of muscle in my smaller/weaker left arm (they're now even), lost 2% fat in my trunk, lost 2.4% fat in my android area, gained 1% fat in my legs but lost 1lb of muscle, and the rest of the muscle gain occurred in my trunk/back.  
* My BMR increased by 200 cal. My RER was .81, which is associated with burning 62% fat, 38% CHO at rest.
* My BMI is 21.7 and although I think BMI is a poor proxy for mass, it puts me well within the range of elite climbers or sends across the grade ranges. I'm right around the realm of Jan Hojer and Jimmy Webb, below a few others, and I could probably carry Dave Graham in my backpack on approaches and not feel winded.

**What/Why I did this**

* I really don't want Dad bod
* I'm a Data Scientist by trade and have spent years in various analytic roles. I believe that anything and everything can be quantified, measured, and improved.  With that said I was sorta curious about where I was at least year and since the initial numbers were not awful, I decided just to eat at maintenance, climb, then reassess in the future. I don't think gaining muscle nor losing weight was necessarily a goal, but coming from endurance sports I really lacked a lot of upper body strength, however, given a background in powerlifting and apparently (according to 23andMe) "overwhelming fast twitch dominance" that stuff comes back fast. From here I might try to cut a bit of fat to get down to 170.

**Diet**

* Remember the Data Science part? Well, it is really easy for me to quantify what I eat so I tend to log everything in MFP when I can. I've gotten good at eyeballing portion sizes super accurately and can easily gauge how much I have eaten/need to eat when outside or eating out. This was probably the most helpful thing I did long-term.
* I started with a zone-ish macro split of 40/25/35 or so based on 2300 cal maintenance. Around February/March I started to have massive issues with energy and recovery. I increased my carbs and was eating around 280-300g CHO/day, ~140g protein or so, and the rest fat for a total of ~2500cal. On some rest days I would eat less and keep protein high. There were quite a few outdoor days that ended with more than this.  I tend to not eat a lot of dairy and most days of the week I eat lacto-ovo vegetarian and minimize gluten, allergens, and shit like that. Most weekdays I eat zero junk food of any sort aside from protein bars occasionally and most weekends I tend to eat really well and when I go out I stay within my macro range naturally. I occasionally have ice cream, cookies, donuts, etc, but generally don't really crave this stuff that much and find that it doesn't give me very good energy. I love Mexican food. I eat a lot of Asian food as well.
* I tried carb cycling briefly and found it fairly uncomfortable to eat 400g CHO on a climbing day. 
* I also tried lower carbs and higher fat, 175g CHO, same protein, the rest from fat.  I felt a bit shitty on this, ended up holding more water somehow, and found myself bored. I've been full keto 3-4 times in the past and didn't fare well on it so despite that RER showing I burn mostly fat, I tend top prefer ~50% of diet from CHO.
* I have toyed with IF a few times and don't tend to do well on the super low carb days. I tend to eat my breakfast at 10, lunch somewhere around 12:30-1, snack before climbing, then huge dinner.

**Training/climbing**

* I have been climbing a tad over a year and currently boulder around the V6/7 level indoors and out (although not as many max grade sends) and have sport climbed 11d outside and 12c inside, but haven't done much of that recently hence the large grade gap.
* As a result most of my training tends to be bouldering. I climb 3-4x/week generally aiming for 1 strength/limit bouldering day, 1 day of climbing as a warmup and then hangboard and gym ring work, a volume/PE day, and a second strength/limit day usually outside. I could edit and add the details, but I completed an assessment from Steve Maisch back in October and have just followed that with a few adjustments ever since. 
* No cardio other than walking my dog, the occasional easy hike with my wife, skateboarding, and walking to/from the train to get to the office. I walk a lot around work even tho I work at a desk. I've done some Crossfit WOD style stuff and it just retains leg muscle. I am hoping that just summer hiking reduces leg bodyfat a bit.

**Edit:** A few people have asked me about tracking steps/daily activity level. I do not do that regularly. I do know that the furthest bathroom from my desk is 125 steps. The nearest break area is 20 steps further. I never keep water at my desk so that I have to walk to get it and I never take it back to my desk. Same with snacks. I figure that by doing that I get at least 1,000 steps/day getting water and prob another 500 just peeing. I mentioned activity commuting, but this is like walk 15min to train, stand on train, walk 20min to office. It's over an hour a day, but not really exercise. My hikes are just trail walks with my dog.  Ergo, my answer is that I do not account for any of this in my activity factor nor do I track it. Walking burns like 200 cal/hr max, breathing burns 80-90. It's a wash.

**Edit 2:** A few people asked what they should do given various stats. Studies show that people can get easy noob gains the first ~2y doing something new and strength based. After that your body adapts and becomes far more efficient. For new people such as myself despite having an old strength stimulus years ago, I was able to nurse some climbing noob gains and recomp a tad. Not as fast as I'd like, but I'm not overweight. If I was more overweight I would keep protein higher and cut more on off days. I do think newer climbers in the "decent" BMI ranges should not do this at all as they will waste all their noob gains. Moreover, these newer climbers should climb as much as possible. I know that's trite, but you will build muscle you need and reduce that which you don't. Your body can only adapt to a few things at a time if that. Don't just do pro training programs to kill 100 birds with 100 different stones in 100 directions. You will end up spinning your tires for the car you haven't built yet.

**Edit 3:** People are concerned about gaining fat in my legs. No, doing squats will not leave me better off as I will immediately store a few lbs more water and glycogen and I already have a lot of leg muscle. Just eating differently and doing more trail hikes this summer should cut down fat in that area, but I still have very lean legs from years of riding. I think a climber really shouldn't worry about their legs unless there's tons of fat there or they're doing big walls/alpine stuff.
2018 Goals 6 month check in So it’s now June, which means that we are officially half way through the year, so I figured it would be a good time to check in and see how everyone’s doing with their goals. 

[Here’s the og thread from January](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/7n9j7o/2018_goals_thread/)

So, spray it all, how’s the year going so far? Who’s made progress on their goals? Set backs? Injuries? What has setting these goals taught you?
good climbing technique/analysis videos apart from neil greshams masterclass series are there any good youtube channels or other that go into depth on climbing technique that you could recommend?
Do you compare yourself to others? I am torn. I have been told from day one to "not compare myself to other climbers" in regards to things like skill, grades, technique, and years invested.
I find it hard to simply compare myself to myself. By doing that I feel like I may never catch up or climb on par with other notable climbers.
Yes, I understand that I may never climb high double digits but I feel that but setting my goals on that or more so climbing as hard as others in the grade range I may be able to one day catch up or come close.

That being said, is it healthy to compare yourself to others as a climber or athlete?
Bouldering versus climbing, which is worse for fingers? Basically prolonged low stress (climbing) versus short intense stress (bouldering). Which is worse for finger joint health?

* I'm not asking for fall injuries or elbow stuff, focus on finger/pulley injuries.
* Have a climber/boulderer in mind with equal skill (V4 = 12a; V7 = 13a ...)

What do you think?

My guess would be more finger injuries in boulderers due to higher peak stress in dynamic moves. But maybe crimping your way up a 30m overhang is equally damaging.

Relevance: I have a boulder background with too many finger injurie in my past. Wonder if I should make the switch to climbing or stop altogether.

Edit: typo.
Best hangboarding routine for newbie gains I am starting to hangboard, and I am kind of stuck between 2 styles of hangboarding routine. The first is the Eva Lopez style, where you do a very low volume of hangs with a lot of rest (like 3 mintues rest between each 10 second hang at the start), and the more classic one of many sets of 6 or so 10 second hangs with 5 seconds rest between them. I would like to choose the style that will give me the most newbie gains since I'm a total hangboarding newb. Any advice?
"Shoulder Strength" I often read about this being important, but ill-defined and as a tall climber want to better understand what this refers to and how to effectively train it. I know that a Physical Therapist, masseuse, bodywork guru, etc. can all diagnose and assess, but spending money to do so shouldn't be a requirement.
___
**Defining, Measuring, and Testing**

**Lattice Training** tests shoulder mobility and stability in their assessment using the front lever, a mobility test, a scap engagement test,  and push-ups. I haven't seen any other assessment that attempts to quantify what this actually means.

**Bechtel** seems to indicate that it is a byproduct of pulling strength and mobility.

**Cafe Kraft** never define it, but in their books recommend ring work including IYTLs, face pulls, and reverse flyes.

In my experience the issue manifests itself as the ability for the shoulders and scapula to stabilize and thus enable the rest of the kinetic chain.  This could be represented on a steeper wall with arms stretched out and hands at shoulder height and having to pinch the scapula together, pull the hands in, and enable enough stability to allow the rest of the body to move and engage properly. **I could be wrong here and this point is open for interpretation**

I thus conclude that Lattice comes closest in measuring how mobile the shoulders are, if the scap can retract and engage the posterior delts, and how much "strength and stability" the front delts have.

___
 
My definition is biased on my own experiences with what I determine is "shoulder stability". I would even add rotator cuff strength in there although this is an area that is not inherently that trainable. You can do internal/external rotations and IYTL variations to maintain health, but it's not like you're going for new 5 rep maxes in those movements either.
___
How to address it:

**[Reverse Flyes](http://cdn1.coachmag.co.uk/sites/coachmag/files/styles/16x9_480/public/2016/07/4-3a-dumbbell-reverse-flye.jpg?itok=0KKGvh1u&amp;timestamp=1469450440) (rings, dumbbell, band)** Engages the scapula and posterior delts with mild rotation. Can cue pinching together the scapula in a horizontal plane and use assistance from the rear delts to "lift" the hand.

**[Face Pulls](http://weighttraining.guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Face-pull.png) (cable, band, rings, dumbbell** Helps engage the scapula, traps, and rhomboids with some posterior delt activation and external rotation. Huge staple accessory movement in powerlifting and olympic lifting.

**[IYTWL](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/16/75/d4/1675d49ba6952b2bcb4638ea54607b42.jpg) (rings, dumbbell, hand, weightless)** Primarily a rotator cuff exercise with scapular engagement and trap/rhomboid activation.

**[Wide Grip Pullup](http://www.workoutbox.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wide-grip-pull-up.jpg)  (bar, rings)** The normal pullup could be used here instead, but some postulate that the wide grip increases activation and pulling by the teres major, rear delts, lower traps, and scapula.  Closely mirrors the position I noted above.

**Rows (rings, dumbbells, barbells)** Too many variations to list, but most climbers seem to use inverted ring rows or archer rows.

1. What else could be added to this list?  
* How can one assess and/or address an actual weakness and what kind of priority should this be given in accessory movements?  
* Where is the line of fixing this through climbing versus needing accessory movements?
* What specific wall angles or climbing styles could address this?

Personally I've found that the reverse flyes seemed nice in practice, but haven't translated a whole lot to noticeable differences. Steep limit bouldering on a woodie using pinches, gastons, and normal positions works well, but is gym-dependent.
Struggling with the beginning of a one arm pullup. I'm having difficulty engaging my shoulder and getting past the first 10% range of motion during a one arm pullup. Going from a complete dead hang to being engaged and with a slight bend in the arm. I have no trouble doing a one arm starting off with a slight bend, but everytime I completely loosen myself up and then try to engage, it feels like my muscles and bones aren't aligned right and pulling through it results in discomfort and pain, and not the good kind.

If I kip, I can get past that bit relatively easy and manage to get into the right position but I can't seem to do it statically. 

Any tips on what I'm lacking and how to train it? I've been doing scapular pullups with +70lbs and one arm negatives focusing and trying really hard during the last 20%.

Any tips are are appreciated!
Rethinking the standard beginner advice of "just climb" TL;DR: Tell new climbers not to "just climb" but rest optimally, be aware of their technique, and don't avoid anti-style routes.

I do believe that the best way for new climbers to progress is to just climb, but I believe there should be a few things added to this advice when it is given: 

* *Optimal rest* 

* *Aware of technique* 

* *Don't avoid anti-style routes*

##*Rest* 
Too little rest: too often I talk to new climbers and they struggle up a route and then explain to me that it is there fourth day in a row and they are tired. Almost all would agree that adequate rest is needed for optimal growth. However, when given the advice to "just climb" this often happens. 

Too much rest: Two months later, that same climber, will come in and explain how they have only climbed twice in the past month cause they were busy. This is not enough stress for improvement. Consistency is key. This is not to be confused with scheduled rest periods throughout the year that allow you to recover. I'm referring to the sporadic week to 2 week rest periods that aren't planned and probably happen way too often. 

General rules for resting(new climbers): 

 * Don't climb more than 2 days in a row 

 * Don't rest more than 3 days in a row 

 * If you feel sore then don't climb 

What should be added or removed?

##*Technique*

 There are many different theories and drills on the best way to improve technique. Be aware of your movement and try to find the most efficient sequence. Don't want to go too deep here as it is meant to be quick advice. 

##Anti-style routes
 Naturally, many climbers(myself included) gravitate toward climbs that are their style. This allows you climb more difficult routes because it is your preferred style. In addition, you feel as if you are pushing your self because you are climbing a grade that is at your limit, instead of struggling at a lesser grade. I strongly believe your desired perception that other climbers have of you plays a big role in avoiding anti-style routes. Who cares what others think? Most people. I get anxiety when the good climbers watch me climb... However, I look at it logically and in reality they probably don't really care about what you're climbing or how hard. They are their to climb, not judge others. 

Fix: Honestly evaluate the routes that you choose and ask yourself if you avoid certain routes for these reasons. You probably are, if even subconsciously. "I don't want to try that crimpy v3. It'll take me longer than this powerful v4. You're supposed to push yourself right? v4 &gt; v3 I'm doing the v4." IMO the routes you do should be hard/easy based on how hard they are for you and not the grade. Grade is a great indicator of what the route is roughly, but you can make a grade of what the route is for you personally. You could switch around the grades in your head and say this crimpy problem is a v4 to me so I'm pushing myself while also working on a variety of styles. :) Try not to worry what others think.

This advice could all be given in less than a minute and I believe is extremely helpful relative to the "just climb" approach.

Let me know what you think! any adjustments that should be made? Please include the logical reasoning behind any suggestions. Is this wrong and "just climb" really is best?

Improving Project Pyramid This past year I've sent 3 V7s 6 V6s and maybe a hundred or so V5s. I want to have more a pyramid shape to my project distribution. How can I widen the that middle grade? Is it by going higher on the pyramid and indirectly work that middle grade? Or tighten up my technique on the those base grade?

Or am I just being stupid and the answer is to obviously spend more time on that middle grade? I feel like writing this post gave me my answer but feel free to yell at me for over complicating this and/or give me some advice.
Fear of under-eating I think a couple of years in the past spent lifting and counting calories caused me to have a binge eating disorder. What usually happens is that I come home in the evening after bouldering/running without feeling any hunger at all. I eat something for recovery/muscle building nonetheless, however, this usually triggers some sort of "bulking" mental switch from the past and I start consuming everything in sight. It actually feels that I loose control and "wake up" an hour or so and understand what I did. 

I came to the conclusion that I might have a fear of under-eating and loosing muscle/not recovering well etc. I am trying to re-establish my relationship with food and would be grateful to hear your thoughts on post workout nutrition. I need to change my thinking from "eating as a weightlifter and bulking" to "eating as a climber" and it is proving to be a struggle. Any input on something related would be great.

Note:
My 1-1.5kcal meal post workout, usually ends up being 3-4k kcal, despite thinking to myself "I am not hungry"
I don't eat sugars or processed foods.
Even when I was in ketosis I could easily consume 2-3k kcal of fat at a single sitting (where people complain about struggling to eat 2k kcal per day)
I am not malnourished/anorexic and weigh 180lbs at 6'1.
Help Figuring Out Periodization Training for Strength I'm designing my first 4 week periodization program to start next week, and really overwhelmed with all the climbing literature on strength training.  Here's my snapshot:

#Goal: Strength
* Increase one Vgrade for my flash grade and project grade
* *obviously a four week program might not be sufficient for the goal. This is longer-term goal to hit by end of Sept.*

#Weaknesses
* Core
* Pull Strength/Power
* Deadpoint
* Core again (tied to weak body tension when deadpointing)

#Training Time
* Mon-Thurs mornings. 90 minutes each day after a 20 min warmup
* *I often climb Saturday mornings with friends, though they don't train. That's a social fun time to catch up and just enjoy climbing*


SO. I'm looking for personal advice but also advice on how to approach strength training for climbing in general. I know I need to hangboard, but what protocol/rest intervals do I need with this schedule?  My max DL and Squat are only slightly over my BW, so I need that, probably?  I do need scapular stability exercises according to one PT session a while back...basically just dumbbell I, T, and Y's. Outside of that I feel pretty lost.

I will keep detailed notes of whatever program I do and will report back when it's done!
A way of dad bouldering For some people that are trying to improve as boulderers, but are also quite busy by having small kids and a full-time job, I post some (hopefully) inspirational information of how I struggle to make everything fit in. I have two little (4 and 5 years old) boys.

Everything is based around my inclination to boulder as much as I could, so on a normal week, I would go bouldering on Wednesday evening after kids fall asleep, and on Saturday morning, taking one of the boys with me. Both of those sessions are quite short and intensive. I am trying to fill some other workouts between those as I could, I like bodyweight training so that is mostly what I do, and it happens to be very good when with kids. Here is my typical week:  


* Monday: Bodyweight pull + fingers. I do some OAC progression, front levers, front lever rows and dragon presses. This all could be done at home with the kids or even at the playground with the kids. The finger board training has to be done at home, but could also be done after kids are asleep.
* Tuesday: I go with a kid to his kung-fu lesson and try to sneak out some bodyweight push while he's on the lesson, the other boy can be with me. I do some straight arm presses to handstands, v-sits/manna progressions, planche progressions and handstand push ups.
* Wednesday: My limit bouldering day, I go to a gym, after boys fall asleep, usually biking to the gym to warm up and then bouldering for an hour, hour and half tops.
* Thursday: Bodyweight push. Same as Tuesday, but I can do it at home or on playground with the kids.
* Friday: I am experimenting with two variants for Friday, I either make it a rest day, or I do same thing (pull + fingers) as on Monday but then I have to make Saturday bouldering more volume oriented.
* Saturday: Bouldering in the gym in the morning with at least one of the boys.
* Sunday: Bodyweight push. Same as Thursday.

I must say, that I had to build myself up to be able to handle that volume, but right now, I think this is ideal schedule for me. Still, when I don't feel like it, I occasionally skip a workout and enjoy a rest day. I am also trying to maximize recovery with proper nutrition, which is hard to do with the kids, but still quite possible to some extent.

  
About the bodyweight exercises I do, I mostly target strength and I also try to minimize time, so I am doing only 5-8 reps and only 3 sets with 3 minutes rest. To save some time on my pulling and finger strength day, I can pull and then hang immediatelly after that, essentially making pull-hang doubles. Also, when resting, I can play with the boys.

  
Bouldering outside: That is quite hard for me to get, but I am trying. What I do is that I plan a trip for the whole family that would go across some rock that I could try something on. I usually just create my own boulders by elimination or do traverses, because that is the only thing you can do on random rock... I really can't take the mat (doesn't make sense as it is primarily a family outing) so everything has to be quite safe without it (avoiding legs above my head).

  
Hope this could inspire someone. You can comment any suggestions to my schedule (but keep in mind, that my schedule is working for me just fine to see regular enhancements), your own schedules, some handy tips, or even criticize me, that I am mistreating my boys :D
How to hold slopers? Hi Guys,

I am bouldering for about 6 months, started almost a year ago but dislocated my index finger so I couldn’t climb for four months, I have climbed half the 6a’s in my gym and I suck at slopers. 

I always thought that the point of slopers was to get as much of the palm of your hand and fingers on the sloper. But a friend of mine, who is good at slopers, really pressures the sloper with the top of his fingers and doesn’t use the rest of his fingers all that much. What’s the right approach?

Obviously I have to improve my technique in how to hold my body position, but I am not sure which grip to use with my hands. Any advice would be appreciated.
PSA: Beastfingers (Grippul) not shipping product, Ignoring emails Just a heads up for anyone thinking of buying a grippul. I pre-ordered a grippul back in January, with delivery supposed to be in February/March. Well, it's almost July and beastfingers is ignoring my emails and keeps pushing back the delivery date on their website.  So take that for what it's worth, but I probably wouldn't order anything from them again. Truly awful customer service.
I want to start lifting to supplement climbing, but I really have no idea how that works I know this has been asked before (I've read a bunch of threads about it), but I can't quite seem to find what I'm looking for.

I currently climb 3/4 days a week, though not on any sort of tight schedule. I feel like I'm hitting a plateau, and I'm afraid of overdeveloping some muscle groups, so I want to start lifting weights, etc. Problem is, I have no idea what muscles climbing works, I don't know what muscles I should target to counterbalance that, and I don't know what days I should target what.

So my question is, how do I schedule a workout routine around climbing? Like, what days should I climb and what days should I lift? Is it bad/okay to climb and lift in the same day? What days should I target legs vs arms vs back vs abs vs chest vs shoulders, etc? Pretty please help out a novice.
Wanted to thank you all I just wanted to thank you all for calling me out and saying I didn't need to hangboard as a v4 climber. Although I wasn't feeling any pain from it, it did make me re-evauluate my program and it is now a lot more climbing and a lot less training and it has paid off already. 

I just onsighted my first V4 and that's something I had previously thought was very far away. 

Thanks!
Exercises to bullet proof shoulders. Hey there guys. I've been experiencing a little bit of tweakiness in my shoulders. Nothing crazy but would like to get ahead of it before it does me. Was wondering if you guys could send your favorite shoulder exercise(s) that really made your shoulders feel rock solid. Appreciat you guys!
Is it possible to be an elite runner and strong climber at the same time? I'm curious to see if you have any experience or know anyone who's both a strong runner and climber. What's their training schedule like? What are the tradeoffs in training?

I'm a pretty avid trail runner (definitely not elite), but I find that when I'm in good running shape, my try-hard abilities on the wall suffer. My goal is to maximize for both - is that even possible? 

EDIT: defining strong. I was going to avoid posting how hard i climb/run since i didnt want to start an internet ego contest, but the hardest I’ve sent is 5.12c outdoors. So basically anything harder than that (more of a route climber than bouldererer).
Hörst: alactic interval training for aerobic adaptation I was listening Eric Hörst's latest energy system podcast about the aerobic power system. Around 1:00:15, he brings up the idea of using alactic intervals to train the aerobic system:

http://trainingforclimbing.com/podcast-26-energy-system-training-aerobic-power/

The idea is that you'd perform brief (5-20s) submaximal alactic efforts with short (40-55s) rests in between. E.g. Campus 1-3-5-7, rest for 55s, repeat 6x potentially for multiple sets.

He says this is analogous to using sprint repeats to get in shape for a sport like soccer. The idea is that adaption comes because the aerobic system is stressed to quickly recover &amp; regenerate creatine phosphate stores between all out efforts.

Anyone try anything like this and see results? It's hard not be skeptical because the desired adaptations are so different from the exercise, but I'm thinking it couldn't hurt to experiment with it, assuming you're strong enough and still doing traditional lower intensity aerobic work.
Why does Adam Ondra climb harder than Magnus Midtbø ? Magnus is stronger than Adam, and more powerful, can do one finger one arm pull ups front levers etc, and is better at raw power boulders than Adam. They are both similar weight.
Yet Adam climbs harder than Magnus, both bouldering and sport climbing, why is this?
Do this show technique is still extremely important at elite level?
Should you always train fresh? Here I am talking about bouldering, and by pulling max I mean when you are trying with 100&amp;#37; effort and are fully rested, I don't mean just trying with 100&amp;#37; effort.

Should you always train when your body is fully recovered in order to pull at your max, or should you train when slightly fatigued. For example- obviously depends on the individual but- having  max sessions resting two full days between sessions, or having 80&amp;#37; sessions and resting a day before the next session.

In 9 out of 10 climbers McLeod believes it is a mistake to want to 'perform' and pull your max in every training session, and to train more frequently although you will be more fatigued e.g. train at 80&amp;#37;; if you are a v12 climber then you are training by climbing  v10's due to your fatigue. With this approach you have more time on the wall and thus more time to train technique.

However I have also read that you should be wanting to pull 100&amp;#37; in order to make big gains, but this could be interpreted at pulling 100&amp;#37; effort so you could be quite fatigued when pulling, or pulling 100&amp;#37; of you fully rested capability in which case you want to be fully rested.
A revelation on hangboarding and finger strength I have never trained half-crimp while hangboarding. The function of a half-crimp and a fullcrimp feel vastly different. In a way a half-crimp feels more "active" because you're engaging more of your fingers at an angle, while open-handing feels more passive. The reason why this blew my mind is because I did a hangboarding session at half-crimp and my performance was very very poor compared to my open hand. I can 3 finger hang with an open hand, but absolutely cannot half-crimp it in a 20mm slot.

I can't believe I haven't paid attention to this.

I posted a few days ago about my tendency to never full-crimp as well as a blurb addressing a particular hypermobility issue in my fingers:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/8tfx61/i\_never\_full\_crimp\_and\_i\_need\_to\_learn\_how\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/8tfx61/i_never_full_crimp_and_i_need_to_learn_how_to/)

u/slainthorny said something pretty valuable which is extremely relevant.

"To get better at full crimping, full crimp a lot! Your hypermobility isn't the problem. The problem is that you are weak in that position. It's not a joint structure issue (well maybe a little bit is), it's a muscular strength issue. "

I realized that my half-crimp (as well as my full-crimp), while it uses the same muscles in my forearms as an open-hand, are weak in that particular position. And considering the dynamic range of crimping positions and angles while climbing indoors or outdoors, having a significantly weaker half-crimp has undoubtedly influenced my climbing ability in a way I did not realize.

I think the largest gain from this is when my fingers come in contact with crimps that are not incut. A vertical incut crimp feels great because you can slot your finger flesh into it and kind of open-hand it. It can feel very comfortable and it "sits" nicely and feels great if its not super tiny.

However, when it comes to flat crimps, especially in overhang or when the crimp is not perfectly vertical, with or without a thumb-catch, a powerful half-crimp position makes more sense than trying to open-hand it. Basically: A half-crimp affords more power to stay on the wall than a open-hand. Not to mention that you cannot make use of a crimp with a thumb-catch while open-handing the crimp unless the thumb-catch is in the right spot.

Here's something to visualize, Daniel Woods climbing "The Process" V16: Consider the times when Woods might full-crimp, open-hand or half-crimp and contemplate for yourselves why each position is used.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr8wPSCsKMc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr8wPSCsKMc)

Maybe I'm an idiot, but this changes the way I hangboard. It also completely changes my priorities in projecting and when I train indoors. I've managed to get where I am with a solid open-hand, but I understand my weakness. I understand those specific moves on the wall and why I haven't been able to stay on.  I'd love to see what anyone has to say.
Tips and Questions on transitioning from indoors to outdoors Hey r/climbharder!

Bay Area climber here seeking some advice/tips on making the transition from gym rat to outdoor climber.

For reference, I climb v8/v9 in the gym. Additionally, I’ve targeted my training to transfer to outdoors by prioritizing finger strength and body tension on 2-3 move sequences on a woody.

I decided to test my abilities by making my first trip to Tahoe and getting on Fresh Tips (V8), a crimpy Tahoe test-piece, and a couple of other easier climbs. Here are our takeaways/questions:

* One can never have enough crimp strength. All the moves on the climb are not that large, but the holds are just tiny. What do people think of just climbing outside extremely frequently as a way of increasing finger strength? Do people think its feasible for the skin/body or is gym climbing and training much more practical?
* Body tension is key. Additionally, body tension is sport specific. It doesn't matter how many ab wheels/leg lifts you can do or how much you can deadlift if you don't know how to apply it to real rock.
* Skin matters a LOT. Maintain your skin like you maintain your tendons and learn to deal with pain. Going off of this, what products do people recommend to regularly maintain healthy skin?
* Temperature matters? It was our first time climbing in such hot conditions and we felt like greasing off nearly all the crimps. Is this normal? Is it even worthwhile to schedule a session in such hot conditions?
* Lastly, any thoughts on the problem itself? Fresh Tips appears to be a non-gimmicky, straightforward crimp-haul. Does this seem like something gym/woody climbers should be good at?
How do you hold crimps on overhangs? Sounds like a clickbaity title, but I struggle to understand how to hold perpendicular crimps on overhangs in particular. Incut edges are fine, but flat or sloping edges, I don't quite get the necessary body positions. Do I need to hang lower, or pull myself well into the wall to try and stay underneath them? Are full crimps more important the less incut an edge is? I always half crimp unless I really put thought into what I'm doing, but I can often barely hang flat edges and get my feet on the board.  

[Image for examples](https://imgur.com/a/sYVMncA) although I'm sure you all know what crimps look like.

Mani the Monkey's Mission 8B. An interesting strategy for sending his hardest boulder project Mani the Monkey is a climbing youtuber, who makes really awesome content. Over the last four days he thoroughly documented his strategy for sending his first 8B boulder problem. It's a four part video series with a watch time of about 1h40mins:

[Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O18cpc4LSRM): Hard training day and strategy discussion 

[Day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqbKTTLXxjo&amp;t=1226s): Dry fasted training day 

[Day 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPB_V5E84CE): Dry fasted rest day with lots of insights into dry fasting 

[Day 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZqCqUVT0WM): Sending day + recap of the mission

Overall I think his process of two hard training and then dry fasting is a rather unconventional strategy for sending hard stuff, because most people would probably not be rested enough to climb hard. It is also worth noting that he chose such an extreme strategy because this was most likely the last day with good conditions in his area before fall.

The other most important takeaway for me was that getting lighter probably beats getting stronger as a short term strategy. 

What I also thought that was interesting was that there is this saying going around that you have to be able to one arm hang a one pad edge for 10s to climb 8B, yet he was barely able to hang it for a second with his right hand and not at all with his left hand in his last finger strength assessment. 

TLDR: dude trained hard for two days, then dry fasted, send his first 8B boulder and documented it all on video
Weekly Bouldering Pyramids for Training I was looking into training a bouldering pyramid to try to prevent spending too much time on easy problems, or too much time projective. I feel like I often fall into the habit of warming up, doing some new problems at the gym, then projecting one or two problems with long rests for the remainder of the session. I was hoping the pyramid would have me put more effort into the middle levels. As a result, I found the following article on pyramids: [https://touchstoneclimbing.com/building-a-pyramid-for-better-climbing/](https://touchstoneclimbing.com/building-a-pyramid-for-better-climbing/)

The article here seems to refer to outside climbing, but does it translate into indoors well? I generally can climb at the V3 to V4 level depending on the style of route and the gym. My home gym unfortunately doesn't do V grades but instead does the following system: 1: VB-0; 2: V1-2; 3: V2-4; 4: V4-6; 5: V7+. Trying to adapt the pyramid to this I estimate the V grade of the problems and place them into the following pyramid:  

Number of Problems x Estimated V Grade (Gym Grade)  

1xv4+ (4)  

2xv3+/4- (3)  

4xv3-/3 (3)  

6xv2/2+ (3)  

8xv1+\\2- (2)  

So throughout my 3 sessions a week I'll try to tick all those problems off my list. I'll try to get as many new problems as possible from the weekly set, and then fill out the pyramid with problems from previous weeks. I've just been repeating this week in and out. Is this a reasonable approach to my training?
Here's a climbing training logbook you can use if you want It's a pretty simple google spreadsheet I've been using to record training sessions, progress etc. Each day has a 'type of session' column with auto-formatting colors and and description column to input drills, sets, reps etc.

Instructions on how to use and edit are included on the first tab of the spreadsheet.

Flexibility/mobility for climbing Just wondering if there are any comprehensible articles/write ups on this topic, and/or if you have any recommendations for climbing specific flexibility/mobility routines? I've always been incredibly inflexible/immobile and I feel it's a weakness in my climbing ability and ability to train (not enough hip/hamstring mobility to do any variation of an L-sit, etc). The routines I've looked at so far don't seem to have much consistency between them and aren't climbing oriented (if I'm being honest I don't want to do a comprehensive flexibility/mobility routine when a shorter/more specific one would suffice for climbing or training for climbing purposes - i.e. I'm lazy). Thanks in advance!
Regrabbing Hello climbharder subredit,

I recently filmed myself when climbing for the first time (not going to share) and I noticed one annoying thing that I do very often: regrabbing (for the lack of better word). Most of the time, I prefer open handing everything unless I have to crimp. When I crimp, it is fine, but when I open hand a hold, I usually readjust my hand on every hold at least once. It looks terrible, not to mention the precious time wasted while readjusting. Has anyone successfully healed such a problem? I realize, that there are occasions, where readjusting is helpful (for example after dyno, where you can't be that precise). My simple plan right now is to try to climb more precisely with my hands, forbid the readjusting, trying to climb problems like that, maybe that could help. The problem may also be psychological, that readjusting my hand makes me more in sync with the hold, not sure. I wonder, If I am gonna be able to climb without it at all, as I certainly don't think about it and I do it automatically. What do you think?

Edit: Thanks to everybody for the suggestions. I will definitely try to heal it using methods and ideas mentioned beyond and I will let you know If I manage to successfully get rid of the habit!
My Lattice Assessment Results **Background**

I started climbing in April 2017. Before that I top roped occasionally with my wife, but by that maybe 1x every 2-4w. My first time bouldering I flashed a V4 and managed a V5 and an old HS friend encouraged me to climb with him.  By July 2017 I had sent V6 in the gym and climbed outside for the first time, nabbing a few easier local V0-3's. By August I had gotten a local V4 (The Ramp) and V5 (Indian Rock Traverse).

I spent most of time just bouldering and learning to lead. In the gym I was doing some Bechtel style strength training because I wanted to prevent injury and coming off of 8 years of bike racing I was super weak. But in about 6 weeks I had a 2xBW deadlift and was fairly strong again. I got burned out on doing so much gym shit because it made me too tired to climb, especially outdoors since my core tension would be shot for days after a deadlift session. 

I submitted a question on Steve Maisch's old site and after a brief exchange, he noted that he was looking for climbers of my grade to build out a dataset for an assessment. I was no flashing some 5's and usually getting most in &lt;5 tries, sending 6's regularly, and had gotten 2 7's. Outdoors I would just go and do as much as I possibly could from V0-4, but avoided projecting. If I got bored of an easier climb I would eliminate holds or do linkups.

I did Steve's test and my results were:

* BW+77.5 pull-up (247.5)
* Large edge max-hang of BW+47.5 (I think on a 20 something edge)
* High anaerobic capacity (80% of max hangs for 7/3 repeaters)
* A conclusion that my lats were probably overly strong and I was not initiating with my forearms enough.

**First Actual Training 11/2017-4/2018**

I struggle to call it that, because it wasn't complex. My main training days were:

* A: Limit/strength bouldering or maximal rope climbing, ring flyes.
* B: Bouldering warm up, hangboard, ring rows, ring flyes
* C: Bouldering Pyramid, hangboard, core on rings.

I started hanging bodyweight on 14mm, then on the BM2K polished small edge, then added weight, then eventually moved back up to 18mm.  I generally did 3 weeks on, 1 deload week of 3/4/4 days/week.

During this time I climbed 40 days outside. If a workout interfered with going outside, I would rest to be strong outside. I very rarely projected things for all that long and would try to do things I could complete in 2 sessions. In January I got my first outdoor V6 albeit a soft local one. In March I was getting a bit bored and had a trip coming up to Joe's in April so I just did full boulder problems (&gt;5 moves), limit bouldering on a woodie (&lt;5 moves), and my ring work. After the trip to Joe's I had notched 30 V4's including 2 V4 onsights, 15 V5's, 4 V6, and a problem that is rated both 6 and 7 (Great White). I almost sent Bring the Heatwole, Big Joe, and Planet of the Ape's, but was super limited in skin and strength by the end of the trip. I basically botched some beta on each one and had I been more judicious about volume and recovery likely could have gotten them. But somehow I can't do a local V5 (Sunshine) that everyone else finds easy so I just blame everything on being tall and old.

**Second "Training" 4/2018-present**

After Joe's I re-tested my hang numbers and I was up to 206.5lbs on the Tension Grindstone 15mm edge. I did a cycle of 5x10 max hangs, same schedule as before and in a month was up to 216.5lbs. I tried pinch grip hangs and was doing 60/hand, but they didn't seem to do much. I swapped out 2 arm rows for single arm. 

My training now is something like:

* A: Limit bouldering, bench press 2-3x5, wide grip pullup 3x5-6, 1 core movement
* B: Warm up bouldering, min edge hang 3x10' half crimp, 2x10' OH, 1 arm ring rows, core movement.
* C: Bouldering pyramid or an cap intervals, hangboard, front lever progression, rotator cuff prehab.

But I got bored, felt things were lacking, but didn't know what or where. I decided that I just don't have the bandwidth to think about this stuff these days with work and life. I've followed training programs/been coached for 15 years and find that when that shit is ironed out, my performance and enjoyment always increases because I can focus 100% on execution. I am about to take on a new role/promotion at work that will really test my skills and likely require a lot of focus, learning Spanish, and might have a kid soon. I want to go outside and just focus on the experience and never once think of if what I am doing is working.

**Assessment results**

**My self-assessment:** I thought that my fingers were meh, core very weak, shoulders not very mobile, ancap very poor, pull strength mediocre, aerobic capacity really unknown honestly, and push on the low side. What I wanted to avoid was being overly strong for my grade level, which IMO inhibits technique learning and is just a waste of time.

**Performance Goals:** Send a few more V7 I have identified, build my pyramid at V6, try to send a local V8 traverse (Nat's or Stan's) by end of year. I have a few goals at basically every crag in the U.S., but those are all within these grade ranges and a variety of styles. I want to get proficient at grade levels, not just tick off a send here or there. Within 1 year boulder V8, climb 12+/13-. Within 3 years boulder V9, climb 13, maybe climb a big wall.

**Technique Goals:** Get more comfortable on gently overhung terrain, high feet, and small crimps. Get more comfortable on route cruxes.

**Note: There are certain things where I am not going to give away their standards. I feel that if anyone is curious we can talk 1:1, but they have spent years creating this business and I don't know if they're cool with it. Anything I do pass along is publicly available if you dig enough:**

* Shoulder mobility: I thought it was quite poor, they said it is actually very good. My hands are within 1 fist of touching when behind my back.
* Front lever: Position 2, knees bent at 90: Very good. They expect a full front lever at much higher grades. This is more a measure of lat and core strength.
* Trunk Stability: Position 2, hands in line with chin. Needs some improvement. Don't know how.
* Hollow hold: 68 secs: They want to see this improve to 90 and given my goals, upwards of that over the next year.
* Pull 2RM- BW+65lbs, or 239lbs (BW 174): Very good and close to their gold standard. Pretty solid since I did a whopping 1 set of pull-ups since October. This score is lower than it was back then actually, but to me suggests that for me, pull-ups might not be worth it. I am currently doing them now to build lat, serratus, and rotator cuff integrity, not just strength.
* Max reps Pull: 18: Very close to the gold standard of 20. Considering I didn't do pullups for almost a year I am not surprised.
* Max reps push: 31: Gold standard of 40. I am doing good, but in terms of my upper body this is an area to focus and improve. Considering my historically weak shoulders I will continue benching until my plan starts.
* HC Max: BW-35/37.5: Right on par for my grade level, slightly high when adjusted for age, gender, and grade level. **Before personalization this would be seen as a limiting factor, but after, it is not. Very important since we tend to compare random numbers online.** They deem I will need a 3% improvement to have the strength for my eventual goals of V9/5.13. Considering what I've gained in just 1 year, I'm not worried about it getting there.
* OH Max: BW-40/42.5: Slightly low for grade level, right on par when adjusted for age, gender, and grade level. **Before personalization this would be seen as a limiting factor, but after, it is not. Very important since we tend to compare random numbers online** They deem I will need a 3% improvement to have the strength for my eventual goals of V9/5.13. Considering what I've gained in just 1 year, I'm not worried about it getting there.
* Anaerobic capacity @60%: 81sec: On the very low end for a route climber, fairly low for boulderer, but well suited for trad climbing, which I don't yet do.
* Aerobic capacity @60%: 91sec: Very good, way above my grade range and into the 7B+ range.  Not surprising since I was an endurance athlete for 8 years.
* Lactate curve: 91, 63 ,:46, :45, :36, :34, :27, :27: Decay rate is on the high side, but lower end is not bad considering how long I have been climbing. I won't give much more info and context away, but it seems that they feel this is very important for long-term development of all climbers.

____
**Where To Go From Here:**

My training with Lattice starts 7/30 and will last at least 6 months.  Until then I will probably continue with my plan as is and focus on an cap slightly. It's not much time to make progress, but it's enough. I might drop the weighted pull-ups completely since they sap recovery time and just stick to my 1 arm rows for my only back movement. I think my hangboarding is fine and not a limiter, but my core clearly is. I also think adding 10min of ARC cool-down if doable might help the lactate curve slightly.

1 important thing this made me realize is that we seem to conflate forearm muscles and tendons a lot. Tendons do not have energy systems. When we talk about hang protocols we often talk about forearm muscle function. Tendons get stimulation through all climbing and all hanging and have a much longer adaptation rate. I've been thinking so much in terms of being strong that I didn't step back and realize that I needed to let certain energy systems catch up.  Lots of boulder problems are longer than 10s and 20s, so only doing hangs in that duration is great for forearm recruitment, but if you don't actually train the muscles in any other way they will likely fatigue extremely quick especially if you never dip into aerobic or anaerobic reserves.  So, I might consider a repeater protocol for a bit, or just wait to do whatever it is they give me.
Becoming a Weaker Climber I've been reading the Lattice assessment posts from /u/KarlWalters, /u/Vertical-Living and (indirectly) /u/FreeSoloist with interest. The training assessment gives you clear guidelines on what to work on, and once I'm more fully recovered from my most recent finger injury I'd be interested in trying it. But I've also got another question, partially addressed in FreeSoloist's blog post: [https://dreamingofgnar.com/2017/11/07/blindedbyscience/](https://dreamingofgnar.com/2017/11/07/blindedbyscience/)  


How can we best and most quickly become "weaker" climbers? Lattice tells you how your finger strength compares to others climbing your grade. How wide is the distribution for higher grades? I've most often seen the question of finger strength framed as "how much stronger can I make my fingers," or "how strong should my fingers be to be appropriate for grade X," usually framed as a 50th percentile finger strength for the grade, and while those are both useful questions, finger strength is a long game - right? What's the 5th or the 10th percentile of finger strength for each grade - and if it's lower (and it likely is), what \*specifically\* do those climbers in the bottom of the barrel use to counteract their weakness? I can recall height being an advantage, and there are probably other morphological factors too, but I'd bet most of it is skill - and I'd love to see comparisons of "strong" vs "weak" climbers at a given hard grade to identify which body mechanics and movement patterns let the weaker climbers minimize finger strength requirements.  


I checked the Climbharder #V3 survey results on Google Drive, but not enough responders listed finger strength on hangboards to start to answer this question - and in any case the survey didn't focus on the other info you might need to address what makes 10th-percentile fingers pull better than they're supposed to. If you're weaker than you "should" be for the grade you climb, what are you doing to make that work? Or: what was your path to climbing harder than you "should" be based on your fingers? For FreeSoloist it sounds like it was repeated injuries leading to loss of strength and forced economy of motion - I've been getting some of this too due to a recent succession of pulley injuries. If injury leads to accelerated technical improvement by taking away strength, there has to be another way to get that same benefit without actually getting injured.
I made a small how-to finger taping guide for A2 pulley strains and lumbrical tears **First off, I want to make clear that I am not a physician or physiotherapist and that all of these methods should be used at your own risk!  Never climb if your finger or wrist really hurts, it's better to walk away for one day than to have 6 months off because you made things worse.**

**Always consult with a physician or physiotherapist about your injuries!**

I've spoken to many climbers before who've thought that finger taping doesn't work at all. I've had a recurring A2 injury over the last 2 years and found a good way to tape for rehabilitation and wanted to share my guide with you here: https://imgur.com/a/yACgz01

When I look around my gym, I noticed a lot of people who tape their A2 after a finger injury are doing it wrong and not providing any support. The usually just wrap some tape around the base of their finger and that's it. Some people use the X-taping method, but use the wrong method to apply the tape keeping their fingers straight and end up without any support for the affected pulleys in turn.


The key to applying tape correctly in a supportive manner all revolves around using the X-taping method whilst keeping your finger bent. I can't stress it enough, but you need to keep the finger bent when you're taping. What this does is basically brace the finger in a bent position. Whenever you try to straighten the finger, the tape resists and makes it impossible to do so. During your session the tape will stretch, but it will still prevent your finger/tendons from overextending and putting more strain on it. I've recommended this method to many climbers with an injury and they immediately noticed a positive difference compared to their normal taping methods.


Another common injury which is often misdiagnosed as a pulley injury can be a lumbrical strain or lumbrical tear. This usually happens in pockets, where one or two fingers are bent and under a lot of strain whilst the others are straight. Too much pressure or a sudden change in the forces applied (finger slipping off the hold) can cause you severe pain when trying to bend one finger whilst keeping the others straight. With a lumbrical strain, crimps are usually not a problem, but pockets and open hand holds will severely hurt. In this case, I've found the best method is to buddy tape the finger to another one. There is usually one finger which exacerbates the pain and another one which removes the pain when held together with the finger which has the lumbrical strain. Buddy taping to the finger which makes the pain disappear whilst climbing casually (no limit bouldering!) for a few weeks usually resolves the issue with the tear. I've had a lumbrical strain for a good 6 months before I started buddy taping it and it went away within a month. 

I hope this is helpful for people out there trying to recover from an A2 pulley injury or lumbrical strain. Let me know if you have any questions or remarks. Finger injuries are always difficult to assess and it's always good to see a doctor about this, however in my experience I've found that not many are up to date with climbing related injuries and after having done a lot of research online and some personal tweaking I've found these two methods to be the most effective.
Creatine: does any of you assume it? **tl;dr;** I've been taking creatine as part of my lifting for over a year, and now that I'm doing more climbing than lifting (about 3:1), I wonder if it's still helpful.

Known pros:

* harder training (e.g. 2/3 more reps while lifting)
* (supposedly) better recovery

Known cons:

* increased intramuscular water retention, which accounts for extra weight,  usually _bad_ for climbing

Thoughts? Experiences?
Cannot grip anything but do not feel pumped Sometimes halfway through a session I will lose the ability to hold anything. For reference, I am a v4-v6 climber but when this happens I can barely get up a v0. I have to batwing to hold even meaty jugs. 

The curious part is that my arms never feel pumped right before this happens and the onset is super sudden. It definitely does not feel like a normal tired/pumpy feeling. On one occasion, I desperately struggled through V0s for a half hour until all of a sudden I was back to normal, but more often than not I get super weirded out/demoralized and take a break for the rest of that day.

Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing?

EDIT: And just to clarify, this is not a common occurrence. It has happened maybe 4 or 5 times in the last year.
I attended the International Rock Climbing Research Association's conference in Chamonix last week. AMA! Hello r/climbharder!

I attended the IRCRA's (International Rock Climbing Research Association) conference last week. It was a 5 day event where trainers, PTs and researchers like Eva Lopez-Rivera, Eric Horst, Klaus Isele and Laurant Vigoroux presented their latest findings. I also presented my own research, which was focused on developing a climbing-specific fatiguing protocol and test of aerobic capacity. I took notes throughout the entire conference. I'd love to disseminate the recent findings and talk about where climbing research is headed.

AMA!

A bit about me: I am a climbing personal trainer, team coach and educator based in Bozeman, MT. I am a CSCS and studied exercise physiology and nutrition sciences during my  masters work. Currently I am working towards getting my research published in a peer-reviewed journal.

My experiences with Chris Webb Parsons 12 week hangboard protocol **The Program**

Inspired by  [u/somerandomaznguy](https://www.reddit.com/user/somerandomaznguy)'s [post on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/8eleyq/review_chris_webb_parsons_12week_hangboard_program/), after hearing about it from a friend and also [Mani the Monkey's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pljRJSpJMvA&amp;list=PLtfngg_GZtb_IbiuBYDCRtXJSkizVf2Km&amp;index=51) about it. I decided to give the full 12 week program a try. For those who don't know what the program is all about you can check out the resources above or [Chris's video](https://vimeo.com/61430224) to get a really detailed explanation. In short it is a 12 week one armed max assisted hanging protocol done twice a week with 9 hangs for each hand. [This table](https://simonrawlinsonphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hangboardprogram_rev1.jpg) also does a good job of summarizing it.

**My training**

I used the 22mm edge of the Metolius Project board for all my hangs with a sling for assistance at first and then switching to hanging on the other side of my door frame with one finger or no assistance at all. All my hangs were completed after getting home from a climbing session. Apart from hanging I on average climbed outside 4 times a week and did some ring training 30-60 minutes 1.5 times a week. My sessions outdoors were mixed sport climbing 2-3 attempts on a project in the afternoon to full days of climbing in some other areas and also a few short 1-3 hours bouldering sessions at some local spots.

**My progress**

Before starting the program I had been climbing for almost exactly two years and I had sent one 8a route and a few 7B boulders. I had some previous experience on the hangboard, mostly doing the [7/53 protocol](http://trainingforclimbing.com/4-fingerboard-strength-protocols-that-work/) by Eric Hörst, which got me up to +36.5kg on the 15mm Rokodromo wooden edge at about 74kg BW in March when the season kicked in. This was also the edge I used for measuring my progress with this protocol. To do so I stood on a scale and pulled as hard as I could watching how much weight I could take off (I know that this method is not very accurate but you can see a somewhat accurate trend). I also chose this method because it was the most specific to the program I could think of and it was very easy to do.

I went from: 

53kg (71% BW)  right hand and 51kg (69% BW)  left hand at 74kg BW to

58.5kg (81% BW) right hand and 57.7kg(80% BW) left hand at 72.5kg BW

I also managed to send 2 more 8a's rather quickly, 3 7B boulders and my first 7B+ boulder. On all of these I really felt like my fingers were stronger than before starting the hangs. I also trippelt my hanging time on the 22mm edge of the Metolius project board from about 2s to 6s.

 **Some thoughts**

* 10s is a really long time for one armed hanging and it hit my shoulders/back a bit more than my fingers. For the first time in my life I had slight shoulder problems, which at least to some degree could be traced back to the hanging
* 5s was rather short in the end and I could complete most hangs without assistance, something like 7s might be the sweet spot
* 22mm is a big edge. I was used to hanging to armed from a 15mm edge and that felt a lot better in my opinion and is also more comparable to real rock where you rarely have hard sequences on 22mm edges (15mm is still big, but you get the point)
* I was probably too weak shoulder and finger wise before starting, so I think that this is, at least in it's unmodified state is a really advanced protocol

**Conclusion**

The protocol was an interesting experiment and it certainly made my fingers and shoulders stronger, but I'll probably stick to max hanging after my summer trip, because it's more controlled and less injury risky. I'll probably revisit the program once I'm quite a bit stronger and can hang smaller edges with one hand. Overall I had about the same experience [u/somerandomaznguy](https://www.reddit.com/user/somerandomaznguy) had and I can highly recommend reading his post as well, if you haven't.

**TL;DR: I got quite a bit stronger, not only in my fingers but also my shoulders. But you have to be very careful to have enough shoulder and finger strength to begin with to avoid injury**
Any interest in a blog involving following the Rock Climber's Training Manual? So I'm going to be moving somewhere where climbing is pretty nonexistent. I will have access to a hangboard, I may have access to campus rungs, if I can find somewhere suitable to bolt them. If I'm lucky, I may also have access to a small home wall. 

Given these conditions, I'm going to begin following a structured training routine for the first time, as I cant really do much recreational climbing. My next opportunity to go out climbing for real will probably be in 1-2 years, so I would be fully committing to this program for that time, and will not see the results until the end of that period. 

If anyone thinks that would be interesting at all to follow, then I will start a blog about it and try to update it as regularly as possible with all training details.

Any input would be great!

Update: I’ve made it! It’s right here 

https://thetraininghouse.home.blog/

Will probably write a new post about 3x a week
Who has tried Lattice Training? Was it a positive or negative experience Apologies if this has been done before (a quick search suggests no, but I could be wrong!)

Just keen to hear if anyone here has had an evaluation or worked through a training plan with Lattice Training and how it went?
[Research] Comparison of the Effects of Three Hangboard Strength and Endurance Training Programs on Grip Endurance in Sport Climbers Just found [this brand new study by Eva Lopez &amp; Juan José González Badillo](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324731332_Comparison_of_the_Effects_of_Three_Hangboard_Strength_and_Endurance_Training_Programs_on_Grip_Endurance_in_Sport_Climbers?_sg=SI6NY9SpW4OCvyah-VlF52NmJKB6lYBwZ6tiT0qSysVD-XXGQ9aBbzfw8iyfplYkt-VdLdGoA3i5GHazB3vQbD5Af9DyFA), where they compare the benefits of max hangs, repeaters and a mix of the two for isometric endurance of the forearm flexors. They're looking at endurance instead of strength since they're concerned with sport climbers in this study. 

Their conclusions are that "grip endurance gains and effect size were 34% and 0.6, respectively, for the group following maximal dead-hang training, 45% and 1, respectively, for the group following intermittent dead-hang training, and 7% and 0.1, respectively, for the group applying the combination of both training methods."

For those of you, like me, have never heard of 'effect size', the study defined it as "The effect size (ES) was calculated to evaluate intragroup 
changes (Hedges and Olkin, 1985) with the formula g = (M1 - M2) / SDpooled, where M1 was the average for the initial test, M2 the average for the post-training test and SDpooled was the pooled standard deviation of the corresponding standard deviations. An ES &lt; 0.25 was defined as trivial, 0.25 to 0.50 small, 0.50-1 moderate and &gt;1 large, according to the scale proposed by Rhea (2004) for strength training interventions on well-trained athletes."

Problems with this study: The total sample size of this study was only 26 and therefore the SD's are really large. Two things that really stand out to me:

a) Looking at the table at the bottom, it's hard for me to say definitively that intermittent hanging was better than max hangs - I really would have loved to see a comparison to see if the differences between the groups was significantly large. While it makes sense that intermittent training would have led to better endurance, some statistical analysis would have solidied the conclusion. I don't remember by statistics enough to do this anymore, if anybody can do it please let me know your conclusion. 

b) It's difficult to say that the mixed strategy was actually worse than the other two strategies because that group's starting endurance was already much better than the other two groups and they end up at pretty much the same level as Intermittent Hangs. Would this strategy have been this useless if they'd started out at a lower level? I don't know.
Consistency vs. Intensity Hello! 

I saw this Joe Rogan clip the other day:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_fbCcWyYthQ

Here is a VERY brief summary of the video:

The guest argues that it is better to work out at a lower intensity everyday rather than a high intensity routine perform 3x a week.

His reasoning is overtime you will accumulate more reps overall giving you more experience therefore making you “better” than the guy working out 3x a week.

My question is: does this apply to climbing?

Assuming my long term goal is to be a good climber, meaning I use correct technique and have strong forearms and core, is it better to climb everyday with a low intensity as opposed to a typical high intensity 2-3 times a week.

I don’t have a strong opinion on this topic but the argument seems valid. If I climb 3 routes everyday that is just the right amount of challenge, then I will have climbed 21 routes a week. If I climb 6 really challenging routes 3 times a week, I am only at 18 climbs with far fewer sends.

Because there are so many variables, I imagine there must be some kind of middle ground that will best for most climbers.

I thought this would be an interesting subject to debate though I do apologize if this has been posted before.
Training Beta TL;DL: Leif Gaisch Sends first 14.b at age 38 Interview here: https://www.trainingbeta.com/media/leif-gasch/

TL;DL: Every day climber spends years figuring out how he can send a goal route at a high grade. Climber spends lots of time along the way trying different training programs/methods and discusses the plusses and minuses of each.

**In the end he found that he needed a lot more rest, a well rounded program, and lots of strength work (maybe based on his size). Learned to identify and ensure quality over quantity. Stops focusing on shit other people are doing or what is en vogue and is able to focus on his own needs**

**RCTM/Anderson Bros**

Good

* Got much more organized with training, started recording his data.
* Was stronger on the moves/edges he trained.

Bad

* Didn't improve while climbing.
* Felt bored

**Steve Maisch**

Good

* Focused a lot on strength, applying core tension, and power.
* Did a lot of movements that were closely linked to climbing such as levers on actual holds.
* Learned that there are a ton more facets and mechanisms to climbing performance. Just being strong in arms and fingers is not nearly enough for performance.
* Gained more power than ever before.

Bad

* Some of the new exercises were a bit too novel/hard
* By the time he got to his projects his power had waned and endurance was great. Didn't do as much to maintain power.  Used a linear program, which could have been the cause.  Could have also come from personal time constraints.

**Gets tendonitis, PT recommends Dan Mirsky to strengthen antagonists**

**Dan Mirsky- Long 4-5 month program**

Good

* Physique changed, looked more fit.
* Felt more balanced
* More well-rounded athlete with a stronger lower body and more push strength.
* Learned to use legs and hips to generate power.
* Sent his project, 14a 
(60ft of low to mid 5.13, rest, boulder problem, steep climbing)
* Note: Discloses at one point that he is 6'3" 190lbs. I take personal note: "Bulk the fuck up bro"

Bad

* Didn't seem to maintain all of it.
* Was not sustainable
* Very tired all the time, even after single workouts. Could often barely move. Was only doing strength training 2 days a week, climbing 2 other days a week.

**Kris Hampton**

Good

* Great coach/client relationship and communication of goals.
* Program preceded his 14b goal (route was similar to 14a, .13c to roof boulder problem, hard face crimpy boulder problem to finish)
* Knew a lot about how he responded to what methods before the program, which provided a lot of context for the training days.
* Stripped away things and focused on core work perfecting basic movements. Re-evaluated a lot of basic climbing movements and found that he relaxed way too much and didn't really think about strength application.
* Lots of bouldering, most training was done within a 30ft radius of a Moon Board.
* Program as 12 weeks.

Bad

* Didn't send. Gained something every single day on route, but the gains were very small. Things were 1 move at a time, 1 piece of beta. Had never had this experience on any previous project.
* Got a bit of shoulder pain so he took some time off. Work picked up for him.

**Steve Bechtel**

Setup

* Nonlinear program, no surprise.
* Was very precise. If it was strength or power things were kept short, if endurance were longer.
* Did no outdoor climbing.
* If he rope climbed in the gym and fell he would immediately start climbing, no resting.
* Never did more than 2 routes in a row.
* RESTED MORE

Good

* First try surpassed high point. Route went down in 8 tries.
* **Learned how to get enough rest. Wasn't worried about specific days or goals.**

Bad

* Endurance pyramid days were way below his redpoint level. His top pyramid route would be a 13a. Had to drop the top grade down.

**Diet**

* Nothing that resembles a program, but eats a lot and focuses on protein and basic nutrition practices such as cutting out sugar and reducing portion sizes.
How does projecting relate to skill and strength development? I'm curious what you all think about projecting, and how it relates to skill and strength development. I think that projecting is (in the general climbing community) a controversial subject, with avid proponents and opponents. The purpose of this post is to generate discussion around the subject. 

What is projecting good for, and why? Who should project, and how long is too long of a project? Is projecting an effective way to develop someone's general climbing ability?

My experience:

I project a lot. I think by serious projecting standards I haven't gotten *too* deep into a project (I've maxed out at about 20-25 tie-ins) , but for some people even 20 attempts on a single climb is unimaginable. The reason I thought to make this post is because of a recent interaction with a coworker/friend at the gym. The jist of the story is that I was struggling on a boulder, and then several friends easily flashed it. Everyone who flashed it typically climbs at a much lower level, and so they were all surprised when I told them that I had been trying it without success. 

My friend/coworker joined the conversation and made the point that "u/lankyspiderlegs is just really good at projecting."   


The fact that I was clearly underperforming on the boulder is irrelevant for our discussion. I'm more interested in my friend's statement. He's certainly not wrong... but I'm not sure if he's correct either. That kind of statement implies that projecting may inflate someone's redpoint grade by developing a narrow set of skills and strengths required to complete the specific project.

My personal experience leads me to believe that projecting has been an effective way to develop general climbing skill. As my redpoint grade has increased, so has my onsight grade. I think that there is a good case to be made that projecting is highly effective for developing general skill, because it should (almost by definition) constitute perfect practice... which should make for great skill development. However, I think that this is a worthwhile discussion point because the actual parameters of projecting differ greatly from climber to climber. Maybe some people go in too deep (too many attempts on one climb, without much time on other routes) and really do only learn how to climb that single climb? If so, what's the sweet spot?

I think that a healthy, skill development approach to projecting would look something like this:

* Most projects should take fewer than 15 attempts (the occasional longer project is good, though)
* Projects should be chosen thoughtfully, and exposure to various styles and rock types is crucial
* Avoid grade chasing. Grades should be used as a guide for approximately how long the project will take you, but if a particular style of climb is your weakness, be willing to spend more time on it.
* Take a process oriented approach to projecting, where the climb is actually teaching you the subtleties of movement until you reach the level of skill required to complete the climb.
* Think of projecting as a perfect repeat, where the goal isn't just sending, but perfect execution.

What are your thoughts? I want to start an open-ended discussion on the subject.
[X-post from r/climbing] I wrote an article with basic biomechanical tips to improve climbing technique. I thought climbharder would appreciate it!
General training for the seriously weak? I've been climbing for about 8 months and have been making reasonable progress (V2/V3, 5.9 - 5.10 in my gym) considering my total lack of athletic background. I know that technique is the most important thing right now and will continue to be for the forseeable future, but I can't help but think that I'm failing to optimally execute certain techniques - especially on overhung boulders - due to my total lack of strength and general conditioning. I'm at a healthy weight (22F, 5'5, 115 lbs) but have never been able to even do a push up, let alone a pull up. I'm in terrible cardiovascular shape but have started a couch to 5k program. Is there a certain type of program that I can follow in order to get to a baseline level of fitness?
What are the qualities of good skin? Hey everyone, I thought it would be useful for us to discuss the qualities of good *outdoor* skin for climbing and how we achieve it:

* No split tips
   * Sanding down dead skin after climbing
   * Cutting off dead skin off tips using clippers 
* Dryness
   * methenamine products (antihydral, rhino skin, etc)
* Short nails
   * Trim nails regularly
* Moisture
   * Moisturize regularly after climbing with ClimbOn and other moisturizers
* Calloused tips
   * Climb outside frequently enough to build strong tips, but not too frequently to cause tears
* Pain tolerance
   * Cauterization (per Ander Rockstad)
* Sticky to chalk
   * Apply rubbing alcohol to skin prior to climbing
   * Using liquid chalk

Any other ideas/methods people suggest?
How to develop Red River Gorge overhang endurance without consistent access to an indoor overhanging wall? This summer I managed to go to the Red 4 times with my friends at Purdue University. While I loved the climbing there, whenever I hopped on the steep stuff, I found myself taking and unable to recover much, even when trying to rest on fairly large holds. Purdue has a climbing wall, but our toprope area has nothing that is even close to the overhang of the Red and our bouldering wall only has a small section of overhang. What's the best way to develop the endurance I need to crush at the Red without the ability to train on long overhanging indoor sport routes?
What if I, someone fairly new to climbing, just want to be efficient in my training? It’s tiresome to hear the same “just climb more” verse being thrown at you every time you attempt to research training for new climbers. I’ve been at it since the start of 2018 and like many others I’d like to do better. I get that you should just continue climbing and the fundamentals will slowly ingrain themselves. Partly, atleast. 

Here’s the thing though. I WANT to do more, to be more effective, to be more intricate with how I train instead of going down there and aimlessly climb. I just don’t know where to start.

I love this sport, I go at least 5 times a week just because I don’t know what else I can do to get better - might as well just “climb more”, right? Finding structure and efficiency (in relation to improvement) has proven really hard to come by as a beginner in this sport. I’ve tried researching this, however everything I find is always geared towards climbers that are at min. a campus board level, which is currently far out of my reach.

I’d really appreciate some specific advice. I don’t expect to powerhouse problems in one month of training routinely, fortunately I’m not that naive. I just don’t wanna look back and ask myself “was there more I could’ve done?”.
Approaches to Core Training Piggybacking off of this article from Training Beta on core training ([https://www.trainingbeta.com/matt-pincus-principles-of-core-training/](https://www.trainingbeta.com/matt-pincus-principles-of-core-training/)) and some dabbling with the Recommended Routine of r/bodyweightfitness I've been thinking more about my approach to core training.

In the recommended routine they focus on anti-extension, anti-rotation, and extension. The first two make sense for climbing, the third makes sense for ~~general health and prehab purposes~~ climbing also (whoops). Additionally climbers care about generating compression and rotation (pulling up high feet, replacing after a foot pops).

Does that reflect in how anyone approaches their core training? From what I can see in the gym most people just bang out a few exercises at the end of a session and call it a day - I'm just looking to build a routine with progressions that will help out my puny core.

At the moment I'm doing weighted deadbugs for anti extension which I think has a lot of transfer to climbing. Also ring rollouts for antiextension. Pallof presses for anti-rotation. And back raises and holds for extension. I haven't ventured too far past that even though there's a ton of other core exercises out there.

Edit: One additional thought that I heard in a podcast somewhere there's some debate over how the core should act in a climber. I've heard it said that it's primary use is to freeze the body and others say it's primary use is to move the body. Either way for climbing I think it makes sense to train both as they're both parts of climbing.

Edit: Extension/posterior chain is equally if not more important than anti-extension &amp; anti-rotation. whoops.

Edit2: After some convincing I'm coming over to the side that deadlifting doesn't have as much benefit to climbing as I previously thought. Too much CNS fatigue and not enough transfer to climbing.
Footwork? Hey all, so I've been climbing for a year now and generally boulder. Lately I've been  doing v4-v5s and I find that my feet keep slipping even when I focus entirely on them. I've been asking around the gym and most people aren't too sure why when they watch me climb. I'm currently using scarpa vapor v. 

I have a few suspicions myself:

1. My footwork is just absolutely atrocious (my main suspicion although my fellow climbers tell me otherwise)
2. My shoes are too big so my feet slip a little.(my feet do tend to sweat a lot and it does get pretty slippery)
3. The rubber has worn out on the soles (highly unlikely since I've been using it for abt 3months)

The problem occurs on almost any tile I step on. Slopes, volumes, edges. It causes me the most grief when I climb slabs and my feet slips from under me. (Not the most fun thing slamming ur chin against a volume below or scraping off all the skin on your shin.)
*developing a fear of heights and big moves hah*

So I'm wondering if anyone had any such experience with their shoes or scarpa vapor v.

Thanks a lot! ♥️
What's the 80/20 for flexibility in climbing? Curious on people's opinions on this... At the elite levels sure everything helps, but for other caliber climbers what gets you 80% of the benefit/value for \~20% of the work/training/time?
Your best climb harder bro science I think it would be interesting to hear about and discuss the most ridiculous climbing bro science, so go ahead and post stuff no matter how crazy it might seem. I'll start: 

- a friend of mine puts antihydral around his finger joints to strengthen the skin like some sort of permanent natural tape and he swears by it.

- another guy always sits on his hands for a minute or two to numb his fingers and make them more pain resistant
Most helpful training podcast episodes? I recently started listening to the Training Beta podcast and found a few of the episodes pretty helpful. I was wondering what are some of your favorite individual episodes from any podcast that you found particularly helpful for your climbing?
Grading sheet for climbing technique/efficiency Through a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/983iyd/research_summary_from_recent_chamonix_conference/) here I found [this overview of the recent climbing research conference at Chamonix.](https://beta-angel.com/spotlight/#_edn27)


One of the presentations that I thought applied here was a practical guide to climbing efficiency (or what this sub commonly calls "technique".) 


The blog author posted a grainy pic of the guide so I re-wrote it and [have published it here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTwTEgzdXun8aOMOsyL_CGzSKiWycn5wgNf5z1i2_Kcs3tOZhHbJGFBX4dxqYp2vAKxSHNSbPE_cVoO/pubhtml)


What are your thoughts on this? There's nothing new or cutting edge, but it could serve as a reference point for reviewing yourself on film, or others that post vids here requesting critiques.
Exercises for compression boulders Here's a question for yall. What exercises would you recommend to train muscles specifically for compression climbing?

&amp;#x200B;

Im thinking of wide- to medium-, full-hand sloper compression, fridge style. Reason I am interested in training it is because Im fairly weak at that style (which I put down to strength not so much technique), and my winter climbing area (which Im training for now) is stacked full of it. Plastic doesnt simulate it very well therefore Im thinking some kind of supplementary exercises are the best bet. Bodyweight and dumbbell recommendations preferred, but I'd be interested in knowing what targets this pulling system.
Ideas for on-the-wall tension training? Hi guys,

I would like to improve my tension while climbing and was looking for some advise/drills to do.

Thanks in advance!
Advanced Climbing Coaching I am an instructor at a climbing gym and was curious what you all think advanced climbing coaching should consist of. 

The majority of my clients are novice to intermediate, and I typically see them for just a few sessions. With these clients I start with climbing fundamentals and build up to a technical framework for understanding climbing movement. 

But, I have a few clients that I have been seeing for a while now that I have kind of given all the lessons on topics I have to give, and now it is more of just refining the skills. So, where I am at now is basically watching them on climbs and giving specific feedback, pulling on the technical framework mentioned before, sometimes with the usage of video analysis.

Is this what higher level skill coaching looks like? My concern is since my instruction isn't introducing as much novel content as before that it is lacking. But, it seems that as you progress in a skill the coaching would eventually get to a point where the novel material runs out and the focus then become refining already learned skills.

I would love to hear what you all think on this topic and any advice you can give me.

P.S. - I am talking about pure climbing instruction, certainly I could branch off into training for climbing, but I am curious about just skill instruction.
Only got a month left before I have to climb for 12 hours straight. With work getting really busy I haven’t had as much time to train for Horseshoe Hell as I would have liked. 

What’s something I should be focusing on the most in order to be boosting my stamina in the next 30 days?

On a side note, I’m considering starting to take magnesium supplements to help with the excessive joint/ muscle and bone use. Anyone have any experience with taking magnesium? Any noticeable difference?
Lead freaks me out I’ve been climbing for a while now and can project bouldering V8s and 5.13as on top rope. I’ve been practicing and can down climb almost any V4 I go up on except the obviously harder ones like dynos etc. I’ve been leading trad outdoors up to 5.7 and feel comfortable doing it and placing pro, doing multi pitches etc. But for the love of god I cannot lead anything past 5.10a indoors and no way in hell im doing it outdoors yet. Why can’t I do this? How do I get over the YUR GONNA DIE mental block whenever I lead. Any advice would be appreciated.
What makes a strong finger? Let us omit all other factors as to why a v15 climber is better than a v5 climber e.g. better technique, more experience, better rock reading ability, more mileage etc. etc. and only consider the fingers.  What is the difference between the fingers of a v5 climber and a v15climber?  What are the physiological differences between the likes of Daniel Wood's fingers and the fingers of a v5 climber with a years experience?  Is a stronger finger the result of....

* Stonger tendons?
* Shorter/longer tendons?
* Stronger bones in the fingers?
* Shorter finger?
* Thicker tissue?
* Larger pulp at the fingertip?

or all things combined?

&amp;#x200B;
Should I focus on hangboarding to get my finger strength up to par? I've been bouldering for 2.5 years now and I believe I've hit a wall with regards to my finger strength. I can do pretty well on techy boulders or slopers/open hand stuff, but I always get shut down by hard crimpy problems in the same difficulty level as the other climbs.

I can't even do the beginner hangboarding routine that's laid out here: https://www.climbingworks.com/files/public/Training_Articles/beastmaker_fingerboard_article.pdf

I don't know how to go about this. Should I just do as many sets as I can do until I can follow the training schedule? Are there any other things which might help with hangboarding and getting more crimping strength? 

**Edit:**

So today I tried to do some hangboarding to see where my baseline is. I followed [this](https://imgur.com/BhaBWqH) max hang schedule on the Beastmaker 2000's big rungs (middle of the board on the outside). I added 20kg (45lbs) to the last 3 sets and maybe could've added another 5kg. I didn't go fully into those edges because it felt too big.

Afterwards I took a 2 minute rest and did [this](https://imgur.com/Y9ir0iI) regimen on the small, bottom rungs of the beastmaker 2000 and could just about finish the entire thing. Afterwards I did some medium intensity climbing, system boarding and a bit of campusboarding as well on the big rungs. 

It felt really good for my fingers, no pain whatsoever, but fatigue did set in on the last sets. I'm not sure how good of a baseline I have and what my method of progression should be though. I have no idea how good or bad these results are.
Training for moonlight buttress I am planning on trying moonlight buttress at the end of November. The hardest I have ever redpointed in Indian Creek is 12-. I haven't been to the desert in a few years but I'm proficient when it comes to crack climbing techniques. I have never formally trained for route like this before. Could someone give me some examples of how i might structure a training session for this objective?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks,
Moon Board problems for shorties I am on the shorter side of the spectrum, 168cm ( about 5ft 50 for the americans). The moon board is not really friendly to short people making some problem way harder than the given grade, our just outright impossible.
I like to use the moon board for my limit bouldering and I am hoping to enlist the help of r/climbharder to come up with a list of shorty friendly problem.

I have access to the a 40deg moon board with the 2017 hold set up. I am mostly after problem in the V5 to V7 range, but feel free to list problem outside of this range or this set up.

I'll start with problems I have done or at least done all the moves (I have only been trying benchmark problems so far) :

* V3
 * To jug,or not to jug ...
 * Bleak House
* V4
 * Termination
 * Blade Runner
* V5
 * shin ramen 
 * Tokinuna
 * Little Black Submarine 
 * Up in smoke (I haven't done the last 2 move, but looks like it's doable)
 * C3PO
 * Forsok-22
 * The Monkey Wrench Gang
 * Sweet to the core 
 * hot pockets
 * Death star

I'am planning to update the post with people suggestion at regular interval. And I'll try to add my list for the 2016 hold set.

Edit: updated list with recommendation
Looking for another dirtbag serious about improving I've been living in my car climbing full time for a few months now and I'm having some luck finding partners but often I don't have one. I'm dedicated to doing whatever it takes to improve my climbing but I feel like I'm being held back by the lack of a dedicated partner. Is anyone else serious about improving that wants to team up with me? I'm in Rifle at the moment and climb 12b/V5. Ideally we would climb/workout/travel together. I can travel anywhere in the US, but I'm loving the climbing at Rifle so I'd like to stay here.
Training while working 11h+ a day Hey there,

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently working from 9am to 8pm on average. Sometimes I can not leave office before 10pm. 

As you can imagine, I am having a hard time figuring out how to train at all. I dont work on the weekend so I try to go climbing on friday/saturday, but I often feel exhausted and kind of lack motivation to get to the gym (30 mins by bike).

I tried to go to the gym after leaving office at like 8pm a few times, but I have the feeling that those sessions do not really give me anything: I am exhausted, I can not focus and I get frustrated, because I fail at problems that I would usually do easily.

I just wanted to ask if there are any fellow redditors out here that deal with similar problems and how you handle them.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;
Long Term Goals Edit: Older climbers encouraged to reply:)

I'm interested in the level of climbing you can maintain at various 'minimum effective' training protocols, and how far below your best this would be.

For example I think I could climb 8a, maybe harder. I imagine I need 5-10 years of consistent training to reach that, sacrificing other sports and other life goals. Will I make those sacrifices? Who knows. But I know I won't want to do that forever, and I also know this:

I can ramp up to 6c with around 3 months of consistent training after a prolonged period of no climbing (say 6 months off). If I ramp up to 7a I think I could maintain this with around 1-2 moderate training sessions a week. I could easily maintain 6b with 1-2 sessions a month. 

I ask out of curiosity, but also practicality. As I get older and wish to spend less time training and allow myself more long periods of no training, what level would I need to peak at in order to climb at grade x with a fairly minimalist training regime? To climb 7a without training too hard, would I need to peak at 8b+, for example. Obviously age will play an increasing factor after say, 50, but lets not get too bogged down in that.

I'm not looking for an answer, or a formula, but a discussion based on experience.

Optimizing Connective Tissue Adaptation I've seen a few times the mention of connective tissue being responsive to training for about 10 minutes and in that time optimized to uptake nutrients to promote adaptation. Furthermore, this window closes for around 6 hours before it can be reopened. Lastly, supplementing with collagen protein and vitamin C around 30 mins prior to exercise augments this adaptation.

I am considering adding light fingerboarding (say 25% of 10sec 1RM) for &lt;10 mins TUT in mornings and evenings outside of sessions. The objective would be to stimulate the connective tissue, at least a little bit, without interfering with muscle recovery, but as a way to boost ligament adaptation to climbing related stress. In the evenings, I'd also drink some collagen 30 mins in advance, but I don't like to eat before 11am.

Curious if anyone has tried anything similar or whether you think this is a terrible idea.

Here's a link to one article that talks about this, along with references to papers:

[http://useful.coach/articles/nutrition-for-soft-tissue-training-recovery-and-injury-prevention/](http://useful.coach/articles/nutrition-for-soft-tissue-training-recovery-and-injury-prevention/)
What is your ideal send weight and how did you find out? As we all know, climbing performance is incredibly reliant on your strength to weight ratio. Increasing strength is always a good thing, but working on the other side of the equation is also helpful. However, it can be tricky to work out how much weight to lose, as if you lose too much, you could lose valuable strength. 

I still do not know what my ideal send weight is. What is yours and how did you find out?

Edit: Can people add their heights as well? Thanks!
Getting Back in Shape after 2 Years Out Hi,

I'm looking for some advice on how to best ease my way back into climbing. 

My basic story is I herniated my L5/S1 disc about two years ago. Right before I did that, I was climbing \~v10 and getting close on some 5.13b/cs outside.

I took two years off to focus on recovery (well, more like I ignored my back for one year, and after the pain got bad enough I decided to actually focus on getting better.) When I was injured I did a lot of weight lifting and core work, with some incline walking to keep my cardio up. I didn't really do any hangboarding because I didn't own one, I had cancelled my membership to my gym, and didn't want to invest in one just because I wasn't sure if I'd ever climb again.

I'm feeling good enough to start climbing again now, and I'm bouldering surprisingly well all things considered: after a couple \*really rough sessions, I'm finding that I am still able to boulder \~v8, or at least pull crux moves, but I have very little stamina. I can climb some 5.11s desperately and have trouble finishing longer boulder problems because I just get tired. I can only climb for about an hour before I'm just dead. I've put on 20 pounds. My fingers are definitely weaker than they were two years ago.

Just looking for ideas on how people would think about getting back into climbing after so long. I used to be a competitive climber as a teen, so I am used to having some structure in approaching climbing, but I don't even know where to start right now. Any ideas would be awesome.
"When Adam Ondra onsighted his first 8c+ he could only do thirteen pull-ups and couldn't hold a one-arm lock-off", Neil Gresham Statement by Neil Gresham in the [Technique - Use of the Toe](https://www.ukclimbing.com/articles/skills/series/neil_gresham_technique_and_training/technique_-_use_of_the_toe-10957)

Can someone confirm this statement? 

Seems quite absurd in these days and even more for an athlete that has been climbing all his life *(up until this first onsight)*. I'd imagine even if he was not training strength in particular, just the sheer volume of climbing that he did would at least develop the one arm lock-off.. I know it did for me at around 7b redpoint.

ps. There was a recent article in a [czech magazine](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/9fxr48/indepth_analysis_of_ondras_movement/) where he said that he now does 13 one arm pull-ups on one arm and 11 on the other, so he had to develop strength to push through 9c/5.15d

*edit*: According to wikipedia it was on March 2011 and he was just over 18.

Protein consumption and recovery Hey all, was just wondering if it is wise to follow the lb of bodyweight per gram of protein rule for climbing as well. Have had trouble climbing more than every other day lately, due to what I believe is a calorie deficit, and was thinking of supplementing extra protein to combat this. Thoughts?
Request for Sticky Post on Rehabilitation/Prehab/Injury Prevention: Hey crushers, 

If you’re anything like me, you might be kind of injury prone. You push yourself super hard and end up getting a boo-boo, that turns into an owie, that turns into a full blown rotator cuff injury. And instead of going to the doctor, you decide to ask a community of people, who are much like you, in that they may have had the same injury. But everywhere you go, you get responses that say, “Go to the doctor.” Your immediate thought might be, “Wow, thanks, I hadn’t f$@&amp;ing thought of that!”

Truth is human physiology is pretty similar and unless you’re suffering from some genetic ailment that only affects 1% of the human population (which is possible, don’t discount that) there’s likely somebody here that has taken physical therapy for an ailment or injury that you potentially have. 

The purpose of this post is the following: 

1. List out common injuries we as climbers face because of the intense nature of our activities 
2. List out good PREhabilitation maintenance/exercise routines to help ensure that we can PREVENT those injuries from occurring in the first place 
3. Create a list of REHABILITATION exercises that MAY assist the injury that you are experiencing 

* This is all under the knowledge that: 
* We are not licensed doctors 
* We are not liable for any types of injuries that you sustain during or after rehabilitation 
* You recognize that the most important facet of recovery is simply REST

I understand that going to a doctor/medical expert is the best move, but can we all afford to go to a physical therapist on a regular basis? Can the medical system in the USA really support us at the moment? Not really. We’re not as lucky as Canadian climbers, or European climbers for that matter. 

Not only that, but if we start working on this, we can refer people to a sticky on the sidebar instead of having the all-too-common “My wrist hurts, what should I do?” post. 

So let’s start working on a sticky page to address Prehab and Rehab. We can occasionally bring in climbing specific physical therapists and give them the opportunity to do some assessments. I think this will not only help climbers make smart decisions in their training regimens, but also help people who just can’t afford to go to the doctor, which is a luxury for a surprising amount of people (sadly).
Utilizing a (Tension, Moon, etc.) Board in Training I'm curious to hear thoughts and discussion on how people use boards as training tools. I'm really liking the idea of training on my gym's tension board about once a week but not entirely sure how to go about it. Is it basically just limit boulder sessions? Should I treat it differently from limit bouldering in the gym because even simple moves feel much harder?
Wrist angle seems to determine when crimp vs open hand is stronger I try to open hand as much as I can, but there have always been certain positions that are difficult to exert force on the hold without crimping.  

I think I have realized what the pattern is....  

When open hand feels strong:

- neutral (downpull above head, far away sidepull at shoulder level)
- flexion (sloper overhead, edge on volume)

When open hand feels weak and crimp feels like the only way

- extension (undercling near face, downpull near hip)
- radial deviation (gaston above head)
- ulnar deviation (sidepull near body)  

Is this true for anyone else?

Overtraining and Elite climbers How are elite climbers going to the gym 5 days a week 2-3 hours at a time and not being over trained?  Some examples would be Jan Hojer, Sean Bailey.

Source: Articles and videos.
Drugs, Supplements, etc. Piggy backing off the Overtraining and Elite Atheletes post, I think opening some dialogue on supplements and drugs would be interesting.

Erik Horst once suggested that creatine can be a helpful supplement when mixed with water while cragging to maintain power throughout the day.

Personally, I take fish oil once or twice a week  as well as some pill concoction that claims to give my body the resources to build healthier tendons and ligaments. Supplements arent exactly an exact science, and Im sure the protein shakes I occasionally drink are mostly shit or pissed out. Regardless--whats is effective and what isnt? What do people take and what do we know about elite atheltes and their preparation for performance?

Specifically,  Im curious about these drugs and supplements that aid in recovery and increased training load
The 1.5 hour training session Been trying to for my training sessions into 1.5 hours but they usually end up 3 hours. Just curious how do you guys go about training efficiently and effectively? What exercises/drills do you get the most bang for your buck?

Assuming I don't go and talk to friends and stuff.
Indoor Holds and Setting Discussion? First home wall I like bouldering, but I'm fairly noobish (v3 best I've done...not even sure if it's a real v3), and there are no gyms close to me.

So I'm building a small wall to practice on this winter. I'm on a tight budget, and wanted to know more about holds and route setting. 

I considered a system board, because i wanted route setting help, but I don't think I'm good enough for them, and the holds are also pretty expensive.

There don't seem to be a lot of starter packs, but this one from Teknik seems nice? https://www.teknikhandholds.com/collections/mix-packs/products/zip-grip-starter

1st Question: Will it give me enough to set up a few routes at a time? Will those edges work on a 30-45 degree wall?

Is there anything else I should consider? I thought about Atomik's discount steep set, but not having matching colors would bother the OCD in me...and the Teknik set seems somewhat comparable.

2nd Question: how do I set routes at home so I can measure my progress/know the grade? Or even to just push myself? 

Thanks a lot guys. I googled around a lot, but hold info is surprisingly paltry.
What do you appreciate most from your gym? What is the number 1, 2, or 3 (more is fine) thing(s) you like or want to see in a climbing gym? 

This could be styles, training areas, or campus boards. Anything! What does the climb harder community think Is important or relevant? 

Novel ideas are always welcome! 

What do you like about your gym (or dislike) and what would you ideally have?! Go at it!
Serratus, pec, and shoulder mobility and stability A few people have asked me about this in various threads since I have noted it has really been a positive impact on my climbing. These two links are a good read and fairly minimal time requirement to implement:
https://squatuniversity.com/2018/09/27/strengthening-the-serratus-anterior/
https://squatuniversity.com/2018/09/14/improving-lat-pec-flexibility/
https://squatuniversity.com/2016/08/05/the-squat-fix-overhead-mobility/
https://squatuniversity.com/2018/08/25/how-to-improve-thoracic-spine-mobility/

**EDIT:** Since other people have PM'd me asking (and I say this with the disclaimer that I am not any sort of professional) I just ran through most of these assessments and drills in batches i.e. 4 one day, 4 another, and figured out what felt tight/immobile. I believe in frequency over volume so I personally selected sequences that I could do in 10min or less and do they while winding down at night, while drinking my morning coffee, waiting for food to cook, whatever. The gym could work too especially if someone loosens up during a warm up, but I don't think using valuable gym time is essential.
Openhand strength translating to pinch strength/Thumbs I've never attempted pinch training, and though I have pinch grips on my handboard I never use them.  The reason being that Im pretty sure open handed strength contributes to pinch strength the most, all things considered. Ive never had problems with pinches at a grade without first having problems with crimps. Also, thumb training, I know... but seriously, does it have a place at all? Ive never seen an open dialogue about it.
I understand flagging/dropknees but find it hard to incorporate them for any benefit I've been watching rock climbing technique videos on flagging and drop knees. In my most recent rock climbing session, I tried to incorporate these moves on routes that I find easy (4-5a) but found it difficult to incorporate them into climbs. Back when I was on the wall, I felt as if doing it was not necessary. Instead should I try on climbs I find more difficult? Any exercises/tips for me?

&amp;#x200B;

Bear in mind, the rock climbing wall I climb on is flat and isn't at an angle.
Gym Climbing Challenges What are your guys favorite climbing workouts other than just climbing one person after the other? I really love endurance/building fitness so I often climb in blocks with my partners. I find it the most efficient way to get a lot of climbing in! Regularly I show up at the gym but don't climb and just belay my partner non-stop for two hours. She comes the next day and do the same for me. I love it when you are in the zone and get tons of mileage. It definitely helps that I mostly climb in the morning (6AM-8:30AM).

What do you guys like to do?

&amp;#x200B;
How to deal with anxiousness Okay, I am one of the more anxious types, especially in rock climbing. Ususally there is not much logic to my anxiousness. As long as I feel in control, it's all doable, but put me on an overhanging wall with difficult moves and I colapse quickly. But on an alpine ridge in crumbly rock with some snow and ice mixed in but nothing too difficult and I happily cruise along. Anxiousness gets to some rediculous heights with sleepless nights and nauseaness in the morning. When the climbing goes along fine it usually gets better during the day and I even find myself enjoying harder stuff, but it is always a precarious balance between feeling great and crying. I have allready given up on trad, and do mostly sport climbing these days.

&amp;#x200B;

What I allready did: I started falling practice last winter in several sessions. It helps, but I need to do it a lot more. Results quickly dissapear it seems. This is in fact learning to let go above a bolt. Learning to do difficult moves above a bolt without fear is another thing though!

Lots and lots of rock climbing. I live in The Netherlands, so it ain't easy to find time and partners, but I try hard to get one weekend a month to Belgium, and several climbing hollidays a year to France, Spain, Italy etc. We also have an artificial outdoor structure in Bergschenhoek near Rotterdam, and I try to go there once a week. This is all lead climbing and seems to help me a great deal.

&amp;#x200B;

Any more ideas, or stories from other people. Are sleepless nights pretty common among you all? How do you deal with this?
Stuck in plateau for about 1.5 years and I feel I’ve tried everything. What are some things you have done to get out of a plateau? I am a 27 year-old female if that helps. I’ve been climbing for about 4 years and for the past 1.5 years I’ve only been able to consistently climb 10s outside. I can redpoint 11s, but I would love to be at a point where I can confidently climb most 11s and start redpointing 12s. I lift, campus and hang board once a week, incorporate bouldering into my training, and work on my endurance with ARC training. Yet, I’ve seen very little improvement. I understand the most important aspect of climbing is to have fun, but after plateauing for 1.5 years, it’s beginning to get frustrating. What else can I do to improve?
Does anyone else ever get discouraged and feel like giving up? This will probably come off as just a pity party, and maybe that's all it is, but does anyone else ever just feel like giving up in climbing?

I have been climbing for 13 years now, seriously for a little more than half of that, and some days I leave climbing sessions feeling very discouraged and just questioning climbing all together.

I know the conventional wisdom is to climb for enjoyment, and not worry about where you are, but let's face it, we are all on this subreddit not simply because we enjoy climbing, we all want to "climbharder".

I feel like I put so much energy into this sport, climbing for over a decade, training hard for years, spending countless hours looking into how to improve, managing a strict diet and scheduling pretty much everything in my life around my climbing, and still winding up feeling less than. I feel like a joke, like I work so hard at this and made it the central piece of my life and I am not even that good.

I normally just have my head down, like I'm so "in" climbing that it's taken for granted, but after a particularly bad session I'll get pulled out of it and wonder is this all worth it, busting your ass in niche activity just to end up feeling like a joke.

I mean if I didn't work so hard and make is such a big piece of my life I don't think it would be that bit of deal to be not that good, but since I do take climbing so seriously it's so hard to feel like I am not performing well, like this is the only thing in this world that I have dedicated myself too, so missing the mark in climbing makes me feel like a failure, and facing that is painful and makes me want to just run away from the sport all together.

Anyways, if you made it this far thanks for listening to my pity party. Please leave a comment if you have any thoughts on the topic!
Rock climbing research and... contact strength?! Researchers call it the "Rate of Force Development."  There's a couple of papers that came out in 2018 at a research conference in France which aren't included, but it's quickly becoming a very interesting indicator of climbing strength.  In a nutshell, you can drill down into the speed of contact at different points, and there is at least one protocol - a typical hangboarding protocol - which has been shown to increase one of the indicators of RFD.  

&amp;#x200B;

Enjoy and feel free to let me know what you think!

critique my minimalist training plan So this is essentially my version of an 80/20 training plan, i.e. 80% of the results come from 20% of the work (more or less). The idea is that if I'm doing any reasonable kind of training on a regular schedule I'll see *some* improvement. About me: climbing about 3 years, regularly onsight 5.11 sport/5.10 trad and boulder V5 (probably, V-grades seem to be all over the place in my local guidebook). Goals for now are mostly just to get comfortable on the next grade up on sport and trad climbs, plus a few hard boulder problems every now and then. Part of that is definitely just pushing myself to try projects more often, since I have a really bad habit of just onsighting stuff -- I onsighted my first 5.12a send not that long ago, which kinda felt anticlimactic. I live in a pretty remote area with no rock gym, so for training I'm pretty much limited to my local crags and a Tension Flash board (the small hanging one). What I've been doing thus far is:

* 3 sets of 5 pullups
* 3x15 pushups
* 1m front/back/side planks
* 2x10 rollups -- not sure what other people call these, but it's essentially just hanging straight-armed from a bar/board, then rolling up the legs up above your chest with the goal of being inverted. I guess it's probably part of the progression towards a front lever.
* 5x10s max hangs on the 19mm edge, currently at bodyweight

I warm up with the first bunch of exercises and then go straight to hangboarding. I've been doing this every other day, sometimes with some climbing on the training day.  As far as technique training goes, it's mostly TR solo laps and contrived boulder problems with a focus on perfect footwork and good tactics/pacing.

SO: tell me what I'm screwing up. Thanks!
My gym only set up Comp Boulder problems, and it's hard to train for volume. What should I do. Hello Climbharder friends. Beginner climber here my max grade is 1 outdoor V5+, my goal is V7 outdoor next year when I'm back to my coutry. So I just moved to Szczecin, Poland. I finally be able to train in climbing gym, my plan was to do volume climbing, lot of different stlye. But this gym only set up problems for Competition with a few problem let say 10 non-Comp boulder problems being easy warm up for 5 problems and others 5 are like V fun. So it's like 20 in total. I've finished 3 Comp problems so far, so I can maybe do perfect repeat with those. But the rest 7 problems are progressively harder and harder. I guess it will take like a month to finish all the comp problems.  So what are your advice in this case ? How should I apply the Just Climb advice ?

Edit: Sorry for misleading message. I mean to say training to gain mileage, to be able to read the problems, climb more efficiently and precisely, not to gain pure endurance.

Spanish-style Endurance Routes in the US I recently got back from a trip to Catalunya, and I was floored by the number of 30-40m+ pure endurance routes there. It's a style that I've never really encountered elsewhere in the US, vertical to slightly overhanging ultra-sustained routes. I've never climbed at the Red, which I imagine to be slightly similar, but I was wondering if there were other crags in the US with a similar style. I've climbed in Rifle a bit but I found it to be quite different, at least in the mid 5.12 range, more often bouldery with decent rests in the middle, or shorter power-endurance. Maybe some of the limestone crags in Utah or Nevada? Anywhere else?
Dave MacLeod's 10 Minute Workout [In one of Dave's most recent videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-diYuavVqzE) he shows a quick 10 minute workout that can be done if you don't have a lot of time to train on a particular day. I typed it out for myself so that it would be easier to follow along and figured I'd paste it here as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

**1.) Pushups**

\-Adjust for strength level (elevate feet, handstand pushup, etc.)

\-Try to not exceed 10.

**2.) Pull Ups**

\-Adjust for strength level (negatives, one-arm, one-arm w/ bungy assist, etc.)

\-Again try not to exceed \~10, shooting for max effort.

**Deadhangs**

**3.) Four finger open hand grip**

**4.) Half crimp**

**5.) 3 finger open hand**

\-Perform on most difficult edge you can

**6.) Endurance Pull Ups**

\-try to get to 20, strict form, use suitable edge
TBP- Up Your Mental Game https://www.trainingbeta.com/sam-elias-level-up-your-mental-game/

Found this very useful. I've read half of these books and like how Elias has looked beyond the trite advice of "work on technique" or "take bigger and bigger falls".  There are so many variables to mental flow, calmness, and confidence that many of the climbing-oriented mental game books don't touch on much.
Hang Protocols Before Injury Hey there. I am trying to collect data to analyze the relationship between various hang protocols and finger injury.  I have created a fairly comprehensive Google form to collect the data:

https://goo.gl/forms/AOXvWxnZL4RuuOi63

Please fill it in ONCE PER INJURY

I am going to leave the form open for a month to start with. If I have enough data I will do some basic analysis and hopefully publish on a public blog by the end of the year. I am not collecting any PII or personal data. I do not plan on collaborating with any other parties on this analysis. Thanks!
Best exercises for heathy back Hey,  just want to ask some general exercises for a heathy back. I have been climbing plus 10 years and I'm not a young stallion anymore (Maybe never wore :) ). My goal now is to find exercises to help with my back before it's to late. Many people start getting injuries in after their 30's and I think it's best to start preventing them before it's too late.


My biggest problem is while climbing on cold conditions and after fatigue. It's hard to fall down properly when your tired and maybe not warm enough anymore. I do climb high balls but never over my limit. I started thinking what kind of damage falling down does to the back, thus how to prevent them. Some times after falling down wrong my lower back gets freaking stiff for few days and really cant bend it down with out discomfort. This also hapen's sometimes while sport climbing.


**Exercises I do now are:**

* some streching (basic yoga poses)

* deadlift in the winter when you can't climb (Actually quite good at this, 170kg with bodyweight of 70kg)

What are your best lower back exercises?

BTW: yeah when your young you feel invincible but just wait until your plus 30 and working your ass of for living :)  


**Thanks for all the replies**

I will sure add few new exercises to my weekly routine. If I would be smart I would go to a proper physiotherapist but thats not gonna happen :)
It's your fingers stupid Stop telling v5 climbers they don't need to hangboard. Climbing is the best form of training yada yada yada.

I spent years plateaued at v5 &amp; 11d listening to people telling me I just needed to climb more, work on my technique etc.

One lattice assessment later with a 5:13 endurance score and a 11c finger strength score I conducted an 8 week hangboard plan and what do you know I got a hell of a lot better at climbing!

If you climb V10 and finger strength has always come naturally to you, you have no idea how benficial specific training can be. Hangboarding is a safe and proven way of getting better at climbing; jump on.

Edit: That was fun, sorry to stir the reddit hornet's nest with a clickbait title.

Some useful comments there in amongst the reactionary spray. As with most things the truth is somewhere in the middle ground. For every overly strong crusher out there who can't use their feet there is an equal number of weak climbers who would massively benefit from some structured training, shock horror off the climbing wall. Gasp! 😱
9-5ers. how long are you at the gym, and when do you eat? I realized that a lot of my issues around training might be scheduling / routine related. I'm stuck with a 9-5 job, more like 9-6 and I can't seem to get out of the climbing gym in under 3 hours. I generally don't like eating before working out hard, or only a light snack. I also don't like eating at 10pm since it keeps me awake, when I want to get up at 6. catch-22

it seems like I can't find a good time to freaking eat, or else I have to pack multiple meals to bring to work.

* 20min - stretching and foam rolling to undo the damage of desk-jockeying and to support the training load, and this probably isn't enough
* 1-1.5 hours - climbing workout. I quit when my technique starts to get crummy. I have 4 workout templates I rotate between, free/social climb (the rarest one, &lt;1 per week), projecting boulders, endurance laps, and either volume boulders or route climbing. roughly along the lines of aerobic, anaerobic, strength workouts.
* 1 hr - supplemental / antagonist exercises, usually one major lift (squat/bench/dead/press) supplemented by core work and 3-5 sets of pushups/pullups

so my day goes something like

6am - wake up  
7am - run  
8am - get ready + commute  
9am - work  
6pm - wrap up work, commute, change  
6:30-7pm - gym  
9:30-10pm - get home and eat  
11:30 - dinner is almost digested enough to sleep

as you can see this is not sustainable, since there's only 6.5h of sleep in there if everything goes perfectly, and not a lot of down-time. I climb 4 nights a week and run 4 mornings a week... if I can sustain it. I do have a "deload week" every 4-6 weeks where I do half the volume and lower intensity of all workouts for a week.

training goals are mostly big long trad climbs &amp; alpine climbs, hence the focus on lots of cardio, climbing volume, and general lifting. to me the most important thing to train is just plain old work capacity, so since i sit all day that logically means, spend as much time as possible doing "work" at the gym. If my climbing technique starts to suck, great, time for some lifting. 

but the reason I'm posting is, it's not working, my schedule goes off the rails fairly predictably every few months either due to mismanagement of hunger or lack of sleep (or overuse resulting in injury). every piece of this feels necessary, like I'd be losing an important piece of training if I gave it up. please, someone convince me of a more efficient way. 

Did I mention I'm trying to lose weight too? I know I don't have the recovery capacity for this. I am just very unsure of what I can narrow my focus on that will be effective at getting me closer to my admittedly broad goal without sacrificing what I feel are important aspects of fitness.
Two-a-day training, diet, and training plan critique: Edit: Thank you all so much for the insight! I hope to get back to y'all with the results of my self-experimentation.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So, I have been doing a lot of listening to Dave McLeod and Tom Randall's interviews on TrainingBeta Podcast, and I have two questions/discussion points I'd like to crack open. Also, at the end of this I have added my current training plan (as of mid October) if anyone is interested or wants to help me to tweak/critique it. I have a fairly high work-capacity and training age and have been in the game about ten years. I climb 5.13a/b-ish (usually unsuccessfully) and just sent my first V11 outside.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my questions:

1.) Two training sessions per day: I am planning to start playing with doing a morning and an evening session the next few weeks of my training cycle. My thought based on my schedule is I should take my free 45 minutes in the morning (\~10am a few days per week) to perform my max hang protocol and do some core. (See below for my actual workouts.) Then, about 6-8 hours later in the evening I will either do an endurance conditioning or limit bouldering session. My question is this: Am I waiting long enough between workouts to reduce neural/adaption confusion on my endurance days?

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Weightloss/mgt: I eat pretty darn cleanly, generally in what ought to be a deficit for my body size/activity level, yet I struggle to reduce my BW, and sometimes even to maintain it! Then, I heard Dave McLeod's interview and he basically lamented the same issue in his own body/training/programming. He mentioned ketogenic/low-carb dieting as a possible solution for some athletes (esp male athletes of a more solid build). Have any of you experimented with this? What were the benefits/negatives of pursuing a keto diet while trying to train/perform in climbing?

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Current Training Plan: I don't campus very much because it is a definite strength of mine, nor do I lift much anymore do to some unwanted glycogen stores/hypertrophy/swoleness (I will occasionally--less than once per month--test to make sure I can still meet my personal benchmarks on bench, DL, OHP, pistol squats, and weighted pullups.) . I am 5'10.5'' and weight sits around 165 most days.

&amp;#x200B;

Max Hang Protocol:

Warm Up Progressively

Then 6 heavy hangs on 18mm (currently adding 100lbs) all half crimp. I hang 10secs and rest 2mins. I add 5lb after 3 sessions (roughly 1 week) currently. Then after 3-4 cycles will do min-edge training.

&amp;#x200B;

Core Workout:

3x5 front lever lifts. (from deadhang to FL and back down all controlled)

3x5 hanging leg lifts +5lbs between feet.

3x5 double-count windshield wipers

&amp;#x200B;

Endurance:

Either ARC 3 x 5-10 mins (depending on time)

or

3x10 boulder circuit. (1 hard boulder on the minute each minute, rest remainder of given time)

or

4x4s

&amp;#x200B;

Limit Session: work on the new/hard (for me) blocs in my gym. Each boulder I give a few rounds of attempts on each section/move and if I feel close I might try to send. Because I have done most of the blocs in my gym (I work there as a setter, so that is an advantage) sometimes I'll make new moves up. We have a variety of styles set, so if I try all the boulders in my limit grade-range I usually feel like I worked myself in a well-rounded manner.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Otherwise, I will go sport climbing or bouldering outside to work my projects and maybe go for a brief run after. (Run/yoga most rest days, sometimes I take them completely off.) At the end of every workout day I do some prehab/mobility and 1-2 days a week I will do weighted OAP with about 8 lbs added.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

(Sorry formatting is weird, my phone isn't the most conducive for writing a novel like this one.)

Finger skin stopping me before muscle fatigue is - advice welcome. I've been at the gym 3 mornings a week for the last few months after taking a 6 month break from climbing due to relocation. I'm getting my old strength back, plus more after focusing my mornings on a moon board routine, a 45 degree training board, and some campus board training.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I'm getting now is that the skin on my fingers seems to be what stops me climbing harder - and not my muscle fatigue.

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips for how to harden up / improve my skin so that it's not so painful?
Best prevention for elbow tendonitis? I know how to treat it but I develop both tennis and golfer’s elbow about once a month whenever I do excessive climbing, even when I warm up and stretch. What exercises are there to build elbow strength so this doesn’t happen? Both antagonistic and other exercises appreciated (and explanations as to why they work would help too). Thanks team &lt;3
Projecting on TR vs Lead In a friendly debate with a (gym) climber friend of mine. Their claim is that you should top-rope send a route first before you worry about trying to lead it, otherwise you're just wasting your belay partner's and everyone else's time by trying to project on lead. My claim is that you should get used to projecting on lead because when you're the person who has to lead outdoors for the group (typically me), you don't have the luxury of trying to top-rope it first, and so exposure to difficult flash/onsight leading is good mental training. What does r/climbharder think about this?
Training Program for V4/5 climber Hello r/climbharder, I've been climbing (bouldering and sport) for a little over a year now, and have been frustrated and stagnating for the past few months. I've been sending V4's and 5's and softer 5.11s for the past few months now, and feel like I'm not really improving at all by just climbing a couple times a week anymore, so I've come up with a tentative training plan. Would really appreciate any feedback on this! All of the guys I climb with are much better than I am, and VERY strong, so it's easy to get discouraged out there but lurking through this community has helped keep me motivated and positive!

Climbing for over a year, can confidently send most V4's (at my gym which is known for stiff grades) and a few V5s. Compared to my previous gym, where I was sending 5's/6's. I'm pretty flexible and good at slab and techy routes, but have a really hard time with overhung routes and specific holds (slopers are the bane of my existence).

&amp;#x200B;

(Tentative) Training Plan:

Climb 3 days/week with rest/cardio in between

Day 1: "Limit" bouldering w/ post-workout max-hangs + core

Day 2: Volume bouldering (focusing a little on routes that aren't my style)

Day 3: "Limit" bouldering w/ post-workout max-hangs + core

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:  
1. In addition to training, should I aim to cut weight? At this point in time, is a little bit of fat holding me back from sending harder?

2. Very new to hangboard training, and I saw that beginners mostly start out at max hangs. Is there something better I can be doing for where I am now?

3. Any shoe recs? Still wearing beginner shoes from when I started.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for replies! Goal is to send V6/5.12 by the summer of 2019.
A few thoughts on "rooting" drills, focus, and mindfulness on plastic Hey folks,

If you're a weekend bouldering warrior like myself, you might have noticed this progression. Your first days on rock, you thrash yourself trying to "find" the right body tension. You're strong, but you're missing, slipping, overshooting. Your hips rise too early, and stay there. You pinch the hell out of a hold, but millimeters left of the right crystal.

But by the end of that or the next session, your tired body and thinning skin are easily executing moves your fresh self couldn't execute. Maybe you send, or maybe you don't, but your eyes have been opened to how much easier a climb feels with the right timing, accuracy, and synchronization of the legs, hips, shoulders, and fingertips.

You return to the gym to discover that certain styles feel quite a bit easier than before. The crimps don't feel so crimpy, and besides, with feet that good, you don't have to pull that hard anyway.

That lasts a few sessions. Maybe a week. But after a while, without rock's constant reminder of the precarity of climbing positions, you sag into old habits. You take footholds for granted. Your attention shifts to gripping and pulling harder. You get stronger, but when you return to the rock, the cycle repeats itself once again.

What a waste. All those hours in the gym, drilling bad habits. Perhaps you think you climb pretty well in the gym, and maybe you do. But let me caution you: if you aren't 100% certain about what rock tension — shoulders, fingertips, core, toes, breathing — feels like and that you're mimicking that on plastic, then you're not, plain and simple. This is a really, really specific learned skill that you only get from practice and experience.

So, how do you practice this?

I'd heard of Power Company Climbing's [Rooting Drills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjtTQYZGMeE&amp;list=PLcC3tGLuho_v72p6MTAR_3hUyfSa9JfLW&amp;index=10) before, but they never quite clicked. "Rooting", to me, implied drilling into the footholds. That, at least, was my mental model when I originally watched their videos. And while that's sometimes the right technique, it's often not, as anyone who's pushed themselves off a boulder can attest to. But the actual purpose of the drill, as near as I can tell, is to try to mindfully exert rock tension in indoor training.

Let me offer a slightly different take on it: Focus Drills. Here, the explicit goal is to recreate the tension and attention required on rock in a gym setting.

First, you need some experience with what rock actually feels like in order to guide your practice, so go out and climb rock. There's no substitute for this, because no person, book, or video can teach you how your body feels on rock. This is another angle to our oft-cited critique of training plans that "lack goals and/or specificity": you don’t floor the throttle on a race car pointing away from the track.

Next, *describe it in writing*. Bring a notebook or daily planner with you to the crag and, at the end of the session or over beers at the brewery, take a few minutes to describe what you did, what felt good, and what felt bad or uncomfortable. As you gain experience, your notes and thinking will become more specific, and reading them will allow you to (partially) reconnect with the physical and emotional sensations described.

Finally, bring that attention and mindfulness with you to training. Pull onto gym routes and problems exactly how you would a rock climb. Execute moves with the same precision demanded by rock. Refer to your notes to help visualize and recreate the sensations you've learned from rock climbing. At the end of your session, note how you performed, and grade yourself on your ability to climb well in the style you know corresponds to rock.

I don't have all the answers (I really don't; I'm pretty terrible), and I'm not sure what *you* should focus on. What has helped me, especially when fatigued, is to always start problems with the right tension — starting in my fingertips and emanating through my shoulders, back, and core through my toes. If I start with the right tension, then usually everything else works itself out. While climbing, my focus shifts to latching the next hold precisely, as though I were aiming for that little crystal, shifting the rest of my body only as far as is needed to complete the move in balance. The focus on the next hold is a bit fanatical, but I'm coming from recent experience on climbs that require that kind of precision, so *that's* the feeling I'm trying to recreate.

---

So, what do you think? How do you approach mindfulness in gym training?

When you step back and think about it, it's obvious that effective training for rock requires mimicking the sensations of rock. It's also obvious, to me at least, that you can't be this cerebral when climbing at your limit, but that's why this is *practice*. I hope some of you find this helpful, but pro or con, let me know in the comments.

Lastly, as an aside: the reason steep boards and slick/wood holds are so good for training is that they, like rock, *force* you to move well. But not all of us have access to those tools, and the point of this post is that, with conscious awareness and experience, you can still practice the right technique without all the equipment. You can — not kidding — even use this when doing supplemental training on the hangboard and campus board.
James Pearson / Alex Barrows Endurance Training Vids/Links I've got a good handle on strength training, but endurance is new to me (and a big hole in my game). In doing some background research, I came across a few videos which seemed to my uneducated self to strike a good balance between having rational foundations and being practically useful:

* [James Pearson: Training &gt;30-move endurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsvGcjTcQbs)
* [James Pearson: Training 15–30-move power endurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByyVqfNKrqA)
* [Alex Barrows: Endurance Training (varied)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GiFnleR9OE)

Alex also wrote a good [PDF on endurance training](https://www.trainingbeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1.-Alex-Barrows-Training-Doc-V2-for-training-beta.pdf) which was published by Training Beta. Alex's stuff is heavily influenced by Tom Randall, albeit with a bit more emphasis on ARC-style training (mentioned in [his Lattice interview](https://www.buzzsprout.com/194099/827113)).

Summary of Alex's video:

* Build an aerobic base through ARCing, climbing continuously with a moderate but controllable pump for a long (20m+) durations. Progress within a cycle by increasing volume, and between cycles by increasing both volume and intensity. (As you become stronger and more fit, you can climb harder while remaining in an aerobic zone.)
* Train long duration pump endurance via reps of \~30-move circuits (\~1m30s duration indoors), resting between reps for about as long as the climbing time (i.e. \~1m30s) , and completing 7–8 reps per session.
* Train short duration power-endurance via hard redpoints or linked boulders (and 4x4s). Rest much longer between sets, ensuring that you can give a quality effort. Aim for 4–6 sets per session.

James's video is similar, but recommends training on lead. I think that's a no-brainer for someone interested in sport climbing, especially if you lack leading experience (like me).

There's also Eric Hörst's [Training for Climbing podcast](https://trainingforclimbing.com/category/podcasts/), but to be totally honest, I'm having trouble getting over how boring it is. If someone wants to dive in and distill it in another post, please do!
Some information on how to use your core to improve movement efficiency, with tips on toes-to-bar and hollow body hold. (crosspost from r/bodyweightfitness)
Share your hip mobility exercises! I've noticed that my hip mobility--and more specifically, my ability to get hips tight to the wall--is a significant limiter. Part of this is core, but flexibility also seems a big factor. Some exercises I'm doing are: 

* Frog pose 
* V-sit-and-reach
* Pigeon pose
* Butterflies

I'd like to to mix this up a bit. What are your go-to hip mobility exercises?

Concept Board, Asking for your thoughts and feedback! Hey Climbharder, 

  
For this past year I've been working on making what I think will be a super fun board!  


A little about the board. ([Image Gallery](https://flic.kr/s/aHskLPZzMJ))

It uses timber holds (Dual tex so they stay nice and clean!) that are fully backlit ^(Yes they glow everywhere)

Last week I finally put together the first prototype of the board. We've been testing out all the shapes with a range of climbers. From V2 climbers right through to national champs and world cup boulder finalists, and am pretty excited on the feedback I've been getting.

We are still working on the board layout- nothing finalized.

&amp;#x200B;

The App is currently in development, but I've worked hard to incorporate a ton of features. It will be very community / social focused. (This stems from the whole idea of the project, which was to be able to have sessions with our friends who are spread out across Australia). 

  
So Climbharder, I am asking you all: what do you like about current boards &amp; apps, what don't like and what extra things would like to see? 

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers everyone!

How many of you film yourselves, and do you think it helps? In a lot of sports/hobbies, filming yourself is a great way to become more self aware of how you're moving. I've not seen much video of myself climbing, but I can imagine finding things out, like:

* "wow I shift my feet a lot more than I thought I did", or 
* "my hips feel close to the wall but watching myself, they're further than I thought they were".

I'm generally curious, how many of you film yourselves, and whether or not it leads to improvement. How often do you film yourself? Sport climbing, bouldering, both? Do you do specific exercises for the camera, or just general climbing/projecting?

I generally feel like I already know what I need to work on because I can *feel* it in my body, so I have never tried it myself.
Power Company Climbing's new Movement Skills for climbers ebook Disclaimer: Goes without saying, but just in case, I have no association with PCC.

I've been thinking about purchasing [Movement Skills for climbers](http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/ebook/) from PCC since it came out a couple weeks ago but was on the fence about it since I suspected it might be a rehash of the same old drills (climb with tennis balls in your hands, Self-Coached Climbing book's drills, etc.).

I couldn't find any reviews about the ebook but I have purchased other ebooks from them and I'm a patreon of PCC since I really like what they put out on the podcast and the general approach they've got to training so I decided to pull the trigger on it.

The $15 it costs are totally worth it; the drills they cover are very much on point and make a lot of sense, also, the way they propose using and escalating the drills is thoughtful and makes a lot of sense. I'm eager to incorporate this into my upcoming practice sessions. The accompanying videos of each drill also help drive the point home.

Anyways, in case anyone else is thinking about it and is looking here for someone's experience (like I did), go for it.

How to protect knees during heel hooks and drop-knees? Hi there, I'm wondering if anyone has tried wearing a brace of some sort, or has any other ideas on how to protect/add support to the knees while climbing?
Callus Health How do you all keep the skin on your hands healthy? My calluses and tips seem to peel off after every shower. I have to wear nitrile gloves all day at work which I don't think helps (I work in a lab so that's unavoidable).
I have climbing specific lotion which I use on occasion and try to avoid body lotions other than when I need it. Even then I often wash it off my hands after applying it.
Sore fingers after hangboarding So I've been climbing for about a year (I'm 41) and starting from a very low base have progressed steadily to about 6b+ or 5.11a. I've recently started hangboarding. I'm careful not to overdo it and do short sessions no more than once a week. However my right middle two fingers have become somewhat sore and tender. Not so sore that i can't climb but i can feel a dull ache on small crimpy holds.

Is this normal after starting to hangboard or is it a prelude to a finger injury and a sign to lay off the finger board for a while?

Edit: sessions on hangboard are short and once a week. I've been climbing three times a week over the past year
Travelling alone to climb Hi, anyone got experience with travelling on your own to climb and finding partners after arrival? Either at the crag or around in the local area.

Recently got my hand on some free time in between jobs, but none of my climbing friends have got the time to travel for climbing with me. So I was wondering about going by myself. Norway based, was thinking about something in the south of Europe, either Spain, Greece or Turkey. Open for other suggestions also. 

Any tips to where it is easier to meet others travelling alone, and where to find these people?
Training for slopers How do you train specifically for sloper holds? I'm climbing in the 11a range but when it comes to big slopes I can't do much.  For crimps I worked on finger strength, for slopes should I practice palming basketballs?
Adam Ondra pinky? Saw the Reel Rock documentary on Adam Ondra this past weekend, and there's a section where he talks a lot about his pinky: "can I get my pinky into that hold?", etc.

I don't remember the details, but I was wondering why his pinky would be so important? What are the mechanics behind it, and how does he use his pinky? Anyone else catch that documentary?

Edit: there's also the part where he's working with the ballet trainer and the trainer does something with his thumb and then with his pinky and they say something about the mechanics / leverage difference, so I was wondering if it's related..
Just broke through a 5 year plateau, figured I'd post what I learned. I finally broke through my bouldering plateau and finished my first V10 (arrowhead arete)! First of all, thanks very much to everyone here who gave me advice along the way, it's always helpful to have some outside opinions to help point out flaws in my thinking. In case anyone is interested (also for my own introspection) I figured I would share some of the many mistakes I made along the way and what I learned from them. Most of it is pretty simple stuff and obviously I'm not suggesting that everyone needs to adopt these things, they are simply the things I wished I'd known from the outset (realistically I knew them all along, I probably just didn't respect their importance).

1. **Don't train for the sake of training.** This was really hard for me to accept, it just felt like if I wasn't training I was wasting time/getting weaker. I really enjoy designing training plans and quite often this myopia on training got me sucked into following some overly-ambitious plans that left very little time/energy for actual climbing. Along these lines, I would always search for strength "benchmarks" to aim for. This idea that "if I could only do a one-arm or 1-5-8 I'll be strong enough for any move and won't have to focus on strength training anymore" is very appealing, but learning to apply whatever your current strength is to its maximum seems just as important (or more so) than increasing this strength. It gets said a lot on this sub, but climbing is very much a skill sport...don't ever downplay the importance of real climbing and learning movement. I am now down to hangboarding and some supplemental weight training as the only off-the-wall training I do and it has helped tremendously. It requires a bit of planning and discipline to focus on the task at hand and not just climb whatever looks cool, but I think overall it has been a very positive change.
2. **Find a like-minded partner or group.** I really enjoy projecting. Getting totally shut down by a set of moves, then slowly learning the nuance until it feels achievable is a wonderful process for me. But I understand that not all climbers feel the same way. Undoubtedly one of the large factors in my plateau was that the group that I usually climb with much prefers to bounce around to different areas. While there is certainly nothing wrong with this, it meant that I would have a handful of attempts at any one problem before waiting weeks/months to return and try again. I finally got one of my partners psyched on projecting with me and having someone else excited to return to a place, schlep pads up to it, and throw ourselves at the problem time and again was instrumental in the send.
3. **Train to your weaknesses, project to your strengths.** Slabs, roofs, crimps, compression...try them all! This has a few benefits. First, it is a really quick way to point out any relative weakness you might need to address. Now, this is coming from the assumption that you want to be a good all-around climber, but I feel like most of us would like to shore up these weaknesses in general. On the other end of the spectrum it may reveal your relative strengths as well. One of the things that I've become very aware of is the importance of the style of the project you pick to work on. Obviously it needs to be enjoyable and inspiring, but it seemed best to pick something that somewhat suited my "style". For me, breaking into a new grade meant that I wanted all the advantages I could muster and now that I know I can do a v10 that suits me I am looking forward to branching out and widening my variety of sends at the grade. I'm curious how others feel, but this mentality seemed to work really well for me.
4. **Pay attention to the victories along the way.** Looking back on it now, 5 years seems like a crazy long time to be stalled out, but I didn't ever feel like I stopped improving along the way. As an extension of the last point, once you achieve some new goal it may be best to fill out your ticklist at the grade a bit with some different styles. Not only does this help to work on your weaknesses, but also provides opportunities for incremental success so that you're not just pushing from one grade to the next.
5. **Avoid injuries at any cost.** I remember reading something along the lines of "an injury is the worst thing that can happen to an athlete" and the blatant simplicity of that statement stuck with me. I've been lucky lately, but early on in my climbing I had quite a few finger injuries and it's amazing how crushing (both physically and mentally) it is to your training. Recently I had a scapular issue and, even though I knew it was okay to climb with it, the feeling of your body being "off" is pervasive and really messed with my mentality. I definitely attribute my current finger health to hangboarding...there's a reason it's one of the few things that I make sure to train off the wall: it is such a controlled environment in which to stress your delicate tendons and pulleys that not only prepares you physically for the stresses but also sets your expectation for what you can actually hold on to and how it should feel. Lke a lot of these personal revelations, it just boiled down to "know thyself" for me, and just required me to have the discipline to forgo or modify a training session if I was feeling off. The minuscule gain you might get from any single session has to be weighed against the risk and consequence of an injury if you're not feeling 100%.

Again, none of this is revelatory in any way, these were just the things that have been top-of-mind for me lately and have been very beneficial for my training. Hopefully it's helpful for others to see, and I'd love to hear what you have learned along the way that has benefitted your training.
Becoming Professional in Todays Generation [Discussion] Hello everyone, 

I wanted to start off by saying I am not asking advice for MYSELF. I just wanted to provoke discussion on what is the route and means of going pro in todays generation of climbing to perhaps benefit the sub, as I havent seen any discussion heavily on this based on using the search bar [if I am incorrect, please share!]

 With Climbing going into the Olympics in 2020 as a Trial run, in addition with the increase of a generation of young people growing up climbing in the indoor gym with many resources of how to climb better I want to ask the following:

what is the path to becoming a "Pro" Climber now? 

What is the path of maintaining the pro level as you grow up as an adult (assuming the person starts at a very young age) 

What will mainly be the lifestyle of pro climbers? 

How do you think the definition of being a Professional rock climber will be in 5 years?

If you have additional questions you want to add to the discussion, please feel free to comment them!
Recently sent my first grade 22 climb (5.11b) and I’d really appreciate some feedback on anything I can do to improve. It’s pretty hard to see any of the smaller details in this video but anything you can pick up on would be helpful. Ignore the cringey scream at the end.
High step flexibility What stretches do I need to do to improve my high step capability?  Specifically, I have trouble with (near) hand foot matches and generally footholds near waist level (both facing the wall and stepping back with my hips 90 deg to the wall).  

My first inclination is groin stretches and IT/glute (hug knee to chest), but I don't feel any stretch when performing high step moves.  When on the wall, I feel more like my leg won't move any further in the direction needed and that I am limited by my ability to flex hard enough.
Rapid Weight Loss, Muscle Loss in Non-functional Muscle Groups Old article by a very well known endurance coach and a tendon/protein synthesis researcher: http://online.fliphtml5.com/mrom/hiie/

This is useful if you want to either lose weight slowly and maintain performance/muscle or lose it quickly to get rid of non-functional muscle from other endeavors.

Key Takeaways:

* 2 approaches are laid out- a fast weightloss designed to actually lose nonfunctional mass and slower weightloss to reduce bodyfat.
* A short extremely high deficit while maintaining a very low volume of high intensity sport specific training can lead to dramatic changes in body composition and purposeful loss of non-functional muscle tissue.
* Example of pro cyclist Bradley Wiggins is given although Wiggins' team (and all other cycling teams/endurance athletes most likely) use corticosteroids as well to eat away tissue.
* Guidelines: For every 15% in energy deficit (from 100%) you decrease the diet by 3 days. a 40% energy deficit would last 12 days, 85% 3 days.
* Of all athletes tested there was a positive correlation between consistent energy deficit and bodyfat.
* Page 4 cites a study that slow weight loss with high protein can lead to an increase in muscle mass in a deficit.
* How you could use it for climbing: During deload/rest weeks; during power training/low volume weeks; a weekly fast or timed restriction; plane flights/travel (airport food and fast food sucks anyways); periodized low days during a week with ad libitum weekend days; and without any supplemental training that would utilize the lower body. So, basically limit bouldering, campus'ing, hangboarding, core.
* Fast reductions should only be used 1-2x in an athlete's entire career. Otherwise opt for a slow reduction.
* .7% bodyweight/week reduction is optimal if going for a slow approach of 7-8 weeks of dieting.  A 70kg athlete would aim for a 490 kcal/day deficit for .5kg of weight loss/week.
* Faster reduction is riskier and primarily to lose muscle in non-functional groups, slower dieting is designed to maintain overall muscle mass or increase it.
What Kind of Training To Start? I have a huge opportunity ahead of me and want to make the most of it! I've been climbing for 3 years and am now moving to Squamish! I've bouldered and trad climbed there for the last couple years and now will have all of it in my backyard! I'm beyond stoked! That said I also want to make my time there as productive as possible and tick some significant boulders, sport and trad routes. 

I currently climb 3-4 days a week and mostly "just climb". I got a Beastmaker 1000 a few months ago and have done some of the easier programs on the app but haven't built a consistent routine. I consistently onsight up to V6 and redpoint up to V8 in the gym. Outside I've onsighted some V5's and one V6 and have redpointed a few V7's and actually got a V9 to the last move (the V9 move of course). I've sent some 12- sport climbing (outside) but have only recently started pushing grades. Trad I've onsighted some 11's and want to keep pushing grades there too as I get more mileage.

My goal is to use this winter to train hard and then whenever the weather is good get outside as much as possible. I have access to a Moonboard, hangboards and a stationary bike, any recommendations on training programs to make solid gains in 12-16 weeks? Crimping, lockoffs and endurance and flexibility are all areas I need to improve on, I excel at big moves and dynamic climbing, I'm good at campusing.

Sorry for the long post, thanks very much for any and all advice!
Is it beneficial to sport climb in the gym? I remember listening to a power company podcast where Kris Hampton said he never sport climbs in the gym anymore and just does hard bouldering. Is this because by getting stronger, you improve your endurance since the moves dont seem as hard? Does this mean that you should rarely sport climb in the gym even if that’s what youre focusing on outside? E.g. just limit boulder and arc.
Training for climbing home Hello climbers !

Is there any of you who regularly do some climbing specific training at home ? Although I try to get out and climb as much rock as I can, finding a partner isn't always possible and I don't really enjoy climbing in a gym. Could you point me to a website or a book that adresses exercices that can be done anytime home ? Obviously I already know about hangboards but I'm looking for other possibilities.
Fear of tiny footholds/Footchips. Any experience overcoming? Ive noticed my fear has increased as Ive been using small footholds, in specific on slabs. Specifically, its just falling and sliding off the wall.  Its irrational, and have created a plan to overcome it: 

Work on footwork technique on small footholds and chips after my hard climb days. Practice feet switched, manuvering around, slipping off them to fall safe. 

I have only been climbing 5 months, and have been doing Hard V3's/Easy V4's [Red's and Blue's at Summit in Carrolton TX), and want feedback about my plan and/or people that had a similar fear and how they overcome it. 


Thank you for your feedback!
Experience with the Moon Board new wood/red hold sets? Does anyone have experience with the Moon Board's [wooden holds](https://moonclimbingna.com/wood-holds-set-a.html)? How about the [red ones](https://moonclimbingna.com/school-holds-set-c.html)?

I've tried the yellow, white, and black sets ([some thoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/a0jd13/weekly_rclimbharder_hangout_thread_for_november/eakxxgm)). I was hoping the wood set, in particular, would solve my problems with the board's "jumpiness" and over-reliance on positive handholds.

The internet's pretty light on details, so I'd love to get some reviews in here. We've had a number of Moon Board threads [over the years](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/search?q=Moon%20Board&amp;restrict_sr=1), but none on this topic.
An overlooked benefit of training boards (Moonboard, Tension board, etc.): a tool for self assessment. The use of the Moonboard (and other training boards) for gaining raw power and strength have been discussed *ad nauseam* on this subreddit. Nevertheless, there is an additional, often overlooked, benefit that I think should be mentioned - and that is the board as static self assessment tool. The power of using a variety of problems (benchmarks and non-benchmarks alike) to track and monitor the fluctuations in our own climbing is, in my opinion, unparalleled. Here is my experience:

I climbed exclusively on the MB for 4 months leading up to rope season. I saw amazing gains in my finger strength and explosive power. During this time I used 4 MB problems (some benchmarks, some not) as "test" problems that I would re-climb every 2-3 weeks. These were problems which I choose specifically to highlight a variety of skills including finger strength, shoulder stability/lockoff, explosive power, and core tension. By the end of this period these 4 problems were still difficult, but easily repeatable.

Rope season arrived, and I climbed less on the MB and focused on building power endurance on a systems wall, knowing that my power would fade.

Rope season passed, and I am now returning to the MB for winter bouldering. After this hiatus I returned to these 4 problems, using them to test myself. I found that I have lost considerable explosive power, lost a moderate level of finger strength, but found my lock-off and core are still well intact. 

I now know exactly what to focus on as I try to revitalize myself for bouldering. 

In the end, we hear of assessment tools in the training podcasts and such. Usually they are oriented around weighted max hangs, overall hang time, or even grip output via dynamometers (spelling?), but rarely do I hear training boards mentioned. So, for those of you with access to these unchanging boards, I highly recommend establishing a handful of problems to use for self assessment. You can then be more objective in deciding what you need to train and what you need to simply maintain. Hope this is helpful, or at least food for thought. Cheers!
How can I use a gym to improve on real rock? There is a massive difference between my max indoor bouldering grade (v7-v8) and my outdoor bouldering grade (v4). I realize a part of this is just not being able to climb outside as frequently + not being able to project something as many days in a row as I can indoors. However, I'd like to hone my indoor climbing/training to be as transferable to real rock as possible. Any tips/resources?

Also, my gym is quite "modern". There are some standard/classic boulders available but there is also an abundance of very dynamic/comp style problems.
Patrick Matros 8 hour workshop review. Today Patrick Matros, the coach of Alex Megos, held a full day workshop at my local climbing gym and I got one of the 10 spots. I wanted to write a little review for you guys and also share some of the things that maybe interesting to you. 

The people there could not have been more apart in age (16-50+) and climbing level (6b-8a), so a lot of the things were focused on more low level intermediate climbers, but he also went into detail with the stronger guys. 

We started of with a short presentation and then covered a thorough warm up. Patrick takes 20 minutes to warm up without even touching the wall (1 hour for Alex Megos). He swears by mobilizing all your joints and muscles and I don't think I've ever felt as ready to climb before. [This video by Udo Neumann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7Zkmx2b_i0) is similar, but not as in depth as we covered the topic. After warming up we talked a bit about athletic training. Some of the key takeaways were that doing OAPs and FLs isn't going to make you a better climbing, but by being a better climber you might be able to do them (Although training them won't hurt you, unless you get overuse injuries, which is the case very often). He really recommended a lot of thera- and powerband work, but these were really specific exercises I couldn't find online.

After a lunch break we finally got onto the climbing wall and did a few technique drills, like swinging out and catching a foothold first time, moving your feet as fast and precise between screw ons while you hands grab onto jugs and finally perfect repeats. Some interesting observations he told us about, was that the Japanese team does six hour long sessions, where they perfect their movements and send each boulder at least ten times before ticking it of. We then did some perfect repeats on the sport climbing wall, which wasn't really that interesting. 

In the end we talked about hangboarding and planning your training. These were some of the most interesting takeaways. He recommend doing two armed hangs on a one pad edge and switching to assisted one armed hangs after having to add more than 30kg. Smaller edges aren't more efficient because it's a game of friction and pain and above 30kgs there is too much of a strain on your shoulders. He also said that you shouldn't hangboard before climbing (as lattice recommends), because it is going to mess with your technique and skill training and that you aren't going to make more significant gains by doing them first. The exception being pro climbers, for example Alex rests at least 4 hours between bouldering and hang boarding and does them in seperate sessions. He also doesn't believe in strictly periodized training for climbing .

Overall Patrick was a really awesome guy to talk to and the conversations we had were the best part about the workshop. There wasn't any ground breaking, revolutionary new knowledge that he taught us about and all of the stuff I've read on about online or in a book. Going into even more detail with some exercises was very interesting and it strengend my perspective to look at things differently. However at a cost point of 150€ I'm not quite sure if it was worth it. If you're climbing in the 6b-7b range and aren't as interested into training for climbing there definitely is a lot to gain from such workshops, but above that you are most likely better of investing your cash into a private coaching session, where you can look at and improve on your own very specific weaknesses. 

TLDR:

\- Mobilize for 20 minutes before climbing

\- OAPs and FLs aren't going to get you to your goals

\- technique drills, especially perfect repeats are great for improving your accuracy and efficiency

\- Hangboard after climbing

\- If you have to add more than 30kg to your hangs switch to one armed hangs
How do I mentally warm-up and turn on "Try Hard Mode" for the first go of the day? Hi All,

I noticed a pattern whenever I work on a route: I always need my first go to "get into" try hard mode and remember how it feels. It seems that no matter what my physical warm-up was, I always need the first go to get warmed-up mentally. I would love to be able to step up to my project and climb hard from the first go on the route, so I can be as fresh as possible. 

Any tips for getting into the trying hard mode and warming up mentally for the first go? Or do you also find that the second go is the strongest one of the day?

Thanks!
Weighted pull-ups correlation to bouldering grades Hi, 

I was interested to see how weight pull-ups correlates to bouldering grades, so I sifted through the data from the last /r/climbharder survey and plotted it out. The data is for a five rep max. 

[Results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT94NeIs-y46036lL_PrF6f4aMCbyNezzuGAy806UK1em1gIy8S-e3ZTT-nylv85Qo7jKzKJN2OmK6g/pubchart?oid=349377034&amp;format=image)

How do power and endurance changes over time and the optimal composition for sport climbers? After a longer period of only focusing on power (maxbouldering, campus, hangboard, etc.) my ability to get rid of the pump on good holds is very bad. However, after just a few sessions of more endurance focused training, the endurance is significantly better. After few more weeks of endurance training  I don't notice much further development of the endurance, but a diminishing amount of power is obvious.

The question that comes to mind is therefore:When training for long term progression in sport climbing, is it most efficient to mainly train for hard bouldering until the last few weeks before you want to be in sport climbing shape and then start doing endurance training?

Sidenotes:- I usually do non-linear periods where a power training session usually includes some type of low intensity aerob capacity ingredient and the endurance training session starts of with some hangboarding and maxbouldering before the endurance part.

\- Many climbers who spend the majority of their time bouldering seems to be able to transition into hard redpoint sportclimbing without extended periods of endurance training. Daniel Woods is one example that comes to mind, I am sure one can find more similar examples.

The idea here is to start a discussion for anyone who has something to contribute to the subject. :) 

[Rough paint model of how I feel that endurance and power change with training over time.](https://i.redd.it/ce906ae8c1221.png)

when training sport climbing in the gym, is it recommended to use as many 'takes' as needed to reach the top? or is it better to climb until falling and then restart the route?
Silent hand and feet When someone posts a video in this sub, looking for some feedback on their climbing, one point of critique comes up immediately and universally: You adjust your hands and feet too much on the holds.

&amp;#x200B;

But then, why do I see this same "technique" in almost any video of the top end climbers, trying or sending some gnarly  route? Adam Ondra is one who is super precise. But most of the rest? Watch this instagram video from Stefano Ghisolfi trying some insanely hard 9a. He readjusts almost every hand hold and often his feet too: [https://www.instagram.com/p/Bq7F5G8HaLJ/](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bq7F5G8HaLJ/)

&amp;#x200B;

So, what is more important, making sure you get perfect contact on a hold, difficult enough for you to need perfection. Or is it more important to conserve energy? And is readjusting really the bad habbit we think it is?
Predicting bouldering grade with machine learning Basing on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/6693ua/climbharder_survey_results/) survey I created a neural network model predicting the boulder grade one can send 90-100% of routes and I would like to know how accurate these predictions are on unknown data. Before testing it out, please read [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/a2l5sf/weighted_pullups_correlation_to_bouldering_grades/ebftqi9/) with more details included: 

&gt;So, I played a little bit with this data and created deep neural network model, which predicts the boulder grade one can send 90-100% of routes basing on one's sex, height, weight, years of experience, climbing frequency and hangboard sessions per week. I don't have time to write a detailed report, but I have taken some interesting notes (remember that this dataset is really small and thus may be misleading):  
&gt;  
&gt;The most important features are one's sex and years of experience.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hangboarding has a similar influence on prediction to climbing frequency and it is significant influence.  
&gt;  
&gt;Arm span/ape index does not really matter (this is why I ended up without this feature in nn model).  
&gt;  
&gt;BMI is trash, neural network was able to find much better correlation between height and weight.  
&gt;  
&gt;Predicting max V grade is harder than the V grade one can easily send and passing one of them as a feature dramatically increases prediction accuracy.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\] Remember that this model works well for realistic data and rather average climbers than unique beasts from another planet. Prediction error is equal to about one V grade.

And [here](https://szacho.github.io/climbharder-ml/) you can play with neural network.

Data nerds, do we have any GitHub projects going? Hey everyone, I am a data scientist professionally and have noticed a few people building predictive models this last week. I was wondering if there has been any talk of having a GitHub or something where we can mess around with data? If there is not, is there any interest in this?

Functional Range Conditioning Experiences I saw an FRC practitioner for the first time yesterday and the experience was overall positive. After years of passive and active stretching, various mobility protocols, and doing almost everything you can think of I was looking for something that does not require a massive time suck or reduction in my climbing training volume to complete. Overall the "science" behind it seems as more or less convincing than any other methods.

At the same time seeing a practitioner is too expensive at the current time unless I use up some of my insurance benefits. Googling just returns proponents of the system from other sports, but I wondered what type of success climbers have with it.
Is it better to do core on rest days or take them as full rest days Some background, I climb V4 (Jtree)- V6(Joes Valley) and have trying to take the whole winter, focus less on performance and focus more on training.  I try and hang every other day, would it be more beneficial to train core on rest days, train it before I hangboard, after I hangboard, or just skip it?
Best ways to improve climbing technique as a beginner? Hey y'all,

As the title says, me and my fiancee have both just started climbing and have been really enjoying it! I'm just looking for some advice on how to improve climbing technique. 

I did the whole D1 wrestling thing where technique is taught on a near-daily basis throughout one's grappling "career", whereas that doesn't seem to exist in a formalized way in climbing. I understand that consistent climbing will most likely be the best way to improve, but are there any resources that y'all might recommend to fast track progress? Would getting a private lesson or two as a beginner be a worthwhile endeavor? Thanks!
How do you plan rest days/weeks during training? How do you all find a balance between training and resting? Been climbing ~4 years now, and after breaking into 12a / V6 in the beginning of my second year I've sustained what seems to be like 1 finger injury a year.

I attribute much of my injuries to over-training. Not taking enough rest days, trying to hard for too long, things along that sort. I seem to struggle a lot with knowing _when_ to take a rest.

* Should I rest after a hard day of training, or can I do ARC the next day and still properly rest my body?
* Is taking entire weeks off primary for rest a thing? And if so, how often do you do that?
* Should I always take two days off after a power training session, or is one day enough?

If any of you have resting rules you live by, I'd love to hear them. Thanks!
In your opinion and experience, is it possible to start climbing at the age of 20 and reach the bouldering grade of v13(8b)?
Improving Heel Hooking Technique I've noticed that I tend to avoid heel hooks and have a very difficult time doing heel hook moves compared to other climbers that I watch. Here's a self-assessment to see what I need to do to turn heel hooks from a weakness to a strength. Here are my thoughts:

1. Continue doing more hip flexibility training (especially frog stretch - let me know others to recommend)
2. Perform technique drills during my warm-up to get better at identifying when heel hooking works well vs. works poorly. Basically just climb problems with open feet, but heel hooks only.
3. As an extension to technique drill above, repeat problems but now focus on applying maximum pressure to each foothold during the heel hook. This will help teach me to apply pressure during heel hooks, and to pull in my hips more during the moves. Progressively work to harder boulders.
4. Play will doing heel hooks with open hips and posting opposite foot, and then with heel hooks with a flagging foot. Learn to identify when each technique works better.

Any thoughts on my learning plan above?

Thanks!

Edit: I tried #2 today and progressed to #3 and #4... Conclusion is that I presently suck at identifying good holds to use for heel hooks, even with open feet. Felt horrible (video'd myself and confirmed as such). I guess that's just a sign I need to practice more!
V4 in the bouldering cave at my gym. I’ve been climbing about a year and can consistently work through these routes. Any advice on form to help reach next level?
Bouldering Wall in my spare room. 2.4 Meters high? Hey guys - winter has drawn in and this year the treat to myself and my mates is to build a bouldering space in my spare room so we can get our climb on!  


I've had a read on the moonboard PDF and I had the width and length but not the height. Its just a standard UK ceiling (2.4m)  I'm trying to see if its worth building to this still and at 40degrees?  


I've bought a load of bigger holds in the aim for doing figures of 8's rather than specific problems to get started. I can actually use more of the room too which will give us quite a bit of space (4m x 3.5m) but its just the height thats lacking and I'm concerned about.  


Anyone done similar or have any advice?
Climb harder by redpointing smarter!! For the full (and slightly better edited) post with pictures visit: [https://dirtbagbeta.com/climb-harder-redpoint/](https://dirtbagbeta.com/climb-harder-redpoint/)

Otherwise, enjoy the read. Hope it helps!

Rock climbing has been an ever-evolving sport. Long gone are the simple days of static rope leading with a bowline knot tied around your waist. The years have shown some amazing technological advances in climbing protection which in turn has helped push the limits of our physical abilities. Enter the *redpoint*. 

&gt;**Redpoint**: /ˈrɛdpɔɪnt/ to free-climb a route, while lead climbing, after having practiced the route beforehand (either by hangdogging or top roping)

This is where (other than bouldering) you send the hardest you can send. However, there is more to redpointing than just trying a route over and over again. I have some tips and tactics to share that might give you the extra edge you need. So if you’re looking how to redpoint your next project, you’ve come to the right place. 

### Lander, WY and a Petzl Clinic

Early July this year (2018) Lauren, Achilles, and I meandered our way up from San Diego to Lander Wyoming for the 25th annual International Climbers Festival. We spent a week surrounded by beautiful blue skies, like-minded people, and perfect sending temps. I couldn’t have asked for more. During that week, I also took the time to advance my skills as a climber with some clinics. 

Charlie Odette (a 62 year-old man who STILL crushes 5.14) and his lovely wife, Maggie, took the time (thanks to Petzl) to run a clinic specifically on redpointing. I was lucky enough to attend said clinic and glean some solid of information from them. They focused on exactly what you would think they would. Choosing a route to redpoint, learning the route, training for it, and of course executing the redpoint. 

#### Choosing a route to redpoint

There is more to choosing your redpoint project then just picking out a hard climb. One of the best tips (and you would think its common sense) that I got from Chuck was to “*Train your weakness and climb your strengths.*” So, if you have mega endurance and hate crimping then maybe choose a nice long overhung route for your project. (Think Red River Gorge.) But if you climb like a mountain goat on slab, then maybe push yourself on some low angle granite. Regardless of your strength, **aim for a full number grade above your onsight** **level.**

After choosing a few climbs that fit your strengths you should test them out. Rig up a couple TR’s, hangdog, or stick clip your way up your chosen few and give the moves a couple goes. This is just a preliminary look, you don’t need to get too in depth. Balance whichever one appears the easiest to whichever is the most fun. (The more fun a route is, the more you’ll want to be on it and the higher your stoke will be). Now that you’ve got the climb in mind, it’s time to start learning everything you can about it. 

#### Learning the route

Step one is research. If you’re attempting the redpoint on a well-known route then chances are most of the legwork has been taken care of for you. Check your resources (Mountain Project, YouTube, SuperTopo, etc…) and see what the masses are saying. Remember though, its just research, not your beta. Just because Jimmy four toes does a drop knee gaston on the crux doesn't mean you have to as well. 

The next step to learning to the route is getting yourself a belayer that is stoked to help. You can be on the rope for hours and an impatient belayer will just make you rush the process. Most people start with the crux. However, it’s important to check out the ENTIRE route. Feel the holds, try some moves, see how they link together. Make some tics, erase some tics, take your time and don’t forget about hanging draws (direction) and clipping stances. 

Identify rests! This is going beyond just finding a big hold and milking it. Maybe you can implement a heel somewhere for a tricky rest or find a hidden kneebar. The more energy you can gain during a climb the better. If you’re having trouble identifying good rests, trying climbing it with a heart rate monitor. You can tell what rests are actually reducing your heart rate and benefitting you. 

#### Specific Training

This is where the fun starts! And by fun, I mean the weeks (or longer) of pure frustration and pain. As climbers, we all like to suffer a bit, so what may be horrible to some is usually fun to us. However, It goes beyond just throwing yourself at your proj and hangboarding for hours on end. You need to memorize the climb, find your faults, and give yourself mini-goals to keep the stoke up. 

Take a note from Fred Beckey and write down your beta. Draw a map or directions that show you exactly what move to do and when. Memorize it. Visualize it. Speaking of visualizing, you can take some pointers from Adam Ondra on that. He might look like a total goof training for a redpoint or flash attempt, but hey, he’s the best climber in the world for a reason. 

Climbing is extremely introspective. Knowing yourself is imperative for climbing at your peek. Knowing your fears and mitigating them so you can focus on climbing is often times overlooked by people. Don’t like a certain clipping stance? Find a belayer that you have faith in and train with them for that clip. Can’t dedicate on a slippery foot on a run-out? Again, communicate that with your belayer. Make a plan. Maybe even practice that specific fall. We can’t forget the mental training as well as physical!

&gt;***Lowpoint*** */lohpɔɪnt/: the lowest part of the climb that you can successfully reach the chains from.*

Can’t hit the redpoint? Go for a lowpoint. A lowpoint is the lowest part of the climb that you can successfully reach the chains from. This helps you learn the top moves in the right mental and physical state (tired and pumped out of your gourd). After you identify your lowpoint, you can slowly start lowering it by a move or two. Then lower it by a sequence or two. Slowly but surely you’ll find yourself going for the send. 

#### Executing the Redpoint

Stack the odds in your favor! It goes without saying that you want every possible variable on your side. Time of day, humidity, temperature, mental state, muscle fatigue, shoes, weight etc… Any and all. Make sure you have the greatest chances possible.

Do a couple of easy climbs to warm the muscles up and prevent a flash pump. Then go for a hard climb (7/10 on the try hard scale) and climb until you fall. Immediately after, eat something high in fat and sugar. Stretch out a bit and wait 30 minutes to an hour or until you feel ready. When you’re ready, go ahead and tie-in and do whatever pre-climb ritual you and your partner might have.

Don't forget that climbing is a mental battle. Before starting the climb, after you’re tied in, start your conscious breathing. In and out, slow, controlled, using the diaphragm. Relax. 

When you climb, climb as you have never before. **Give every single move 100% of your focus and intention**. Don't worry about the risks, you already covered and mitigated all of those. There is nothing left but to fire off the muscle memory. When achieved, it will be one of the greatest feelings ever. Every move will feel easy as you fall into a meditative state and flow up the rock. 

Falling is not Failure

You might still punt. That’s fine. Just because you fall doesn't mean you failed. Take it, learn from it, and add it to your repertoire of beta. This is redpointing. You are going to fall a lot. Even if you were to fall two thousand times in the same spot it’s not failure. It's not failure until you give up and tell yourself that you can never do it. But as rock climbers**, we are a tenacious hard-headed group of masochists that never quit**, so I wouldn't really worry about failing.
2018 Year in Review: What did you learn? Think back over the past 12 months. What **3-5** things did you learn that have significantly shaped your climbing or training?

I'll start, though mine are hopefully obvious to y'all. :)

1. **Engage your thumbs.** I'm usually an open hand / crimp climber, which caused me to neglect my pinch strength. Moonboarding and crimpy steep routes taught me how valuable it is to engage the thumb on things that don't seem immediately pinchable--like flat crimps and some slopers. It gives me a few extra vectors of control that I otherwise wouldn't have. Training-wise, I do some extra weighted sets on pinch blocks.   

2. **Rest way more than you think.** Even when you don't think you're tired, rest. Rest more than you think. Tell your belayer beforehand if you get anxiety about not moving.   

3. **Pull harder with your toes.** This year, I've started really toeing in and clamping down with both feet whenever I can. This has helped me stay much more in control and keep hips into the wall. I was inspired by re-watching DWoods segment on Defying Gravity in [Huntsman](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/huntsmen). Training-wise, my hamstrings are pretty weak, so I've been doing hamstring curls on the exercise ball.   

4. **Keep your hips in**. Watching the [amateur phone footage Margo's send of Biographie](https://trainingforclimbing.com/what-you-can-learn-from-margo-hayes-send-of-biography-5-15a/) revealed many things, but none so critical as how important it is to keep your hips in. Doing so helps me engage my toes so that I can take load off my arms. Now, I consciously think about grazing my knees and hips against the wall as I climb through hard sections. Training wise, this led me to prioritize hip mobility, especially turnout.  

5. **Harness vocals**. I'm a quiet person and usually the last person to make noise while climbing. However, I've found that sound has a weirdly positive feedback loop that can make me *try just a little bit harder*. I'm not going full-Ondra but, training-wise, I make a point to practice vocalizing a few distinct sounds that map to how hard I'm trying.

What about y'all? Any big takeaways this year?
Finger Pulp, Max Strength and Training Objectives So I was reading [this article](https://www.climbing.com/news/why-finger-pulp-not-tendon-strength-makes-for-better-crimping/) about how finger pulp is a better predicator of small crimp ability than finger strength on larger edge and it seemed to contradict a bit with what's commonly said around here, I felt like a discussion on that could be nice.

So here's the TLDR of the study and the article :
* Squishiness of finger pulp is more important than max strength on one-pad edge for small crimps
* Max strength on 12.5mm doesn't predicate strength on 4mm
* Stronger (lead) climbers (&gt; 5.13/8a) are stronger on 6mm edges than less strong climbers

So here's what i'm having issues with :

First of all this would seem to make sense, in a "if you want to get better at small edges train on small edges" kind of way, assuming that adaptations occurs with training on small edges (which the article doesn't mention if so). But this also contradicts the "edge size doesn't matter if the weight is challenging" thinking that has be said many times around here...

That being said, it seems unlikely that things are all black and white, that someone would have very little strength on 12.5mm and a lot on 4mm, and so it would explain how a program like Eva Lopez's has good results, as it trains overall forearm strength on a larger edge and min edge adaptation, which then both combine for strength on min edge.

So in the end how can we pick the best edge to train on after all ?
Is there a market for technical and tactical coaching adults? I'm not interested in (or qualified for) physical coaching. And I'm not particularly interested in coaching kids, although I realize that's where the bulk of the market is.

Most climbers I know don't realize their goals because of a failure to maximize their efforts tactically, technically, or emotionally. Rarely do I see people fail as a result of a lack of physical training, and when I do it's usually either because they're young or their goal was inappropriate. I want to help people succeed, but I have doubts as to whether climbers see the same value in this kind of coaching that I do.

What do you think?
The science of Mobility: What do we know? I've researched the science of nutrition, fitness, weightlifting, and climbing training.

But no topic has stumped me like mobility. Recently it seems FRC and its CARS, PAILS, and RAILS are getting crazy popular, but before that the cool mobility work was MobilityWOD. Then there's the static vs dynamic vs PNF debate. Then there's timing debates: Do you hold a stretch for 30 sec, 2 min, or something else? What does it take to actually trigger cellular change in the tissue? Then theres foam rolling/active release (lacrosse balls and all that). Do we have any valid studies that prove active release techniques do anything for/to the body (in terms of mobility)? If so, how long were they performing the release?

**Basically, what we want with mobility is increased controlled ROM in a joint. So, what valid studies do we have that demonstrate achieving this goal?**

Note I'm not looking for anecdotal evidence, not that your personal testimony isn't valid, but just specifically for this thread I think it'd be better to gather scientific resources only.



Edit: I want to compile every valid study here and do a follow up post to this summarizing it all, if that's necessary. So please provide sources!
What is the worst advice you can give to a new climber? New climber being &lt; 2 years. This also assumes that the new climber's goal is to improve at climbing.
I have broad shoulders, a wide rib cage and am looking for reassurance. Hey guys,

First off, I just want to mention how helpful this subreddit has been with ensuring that I’ve been progressing in a practical and efficient manner. So thanks!

I’ve been curious as to how I can train in such a way as to address my personal weaknesses. I’m currently 6ft tall and 180ish pounds (thinnest I’ve ever been by a long shot) I was born with stocky, broad shoulders and such but I’m tired of using it as an excuse for myself. This summer I’m determined to redpoint my first 5.12’s. I think I need to cut weight but also don’t want to lose strength?? (Idk but I do a lot of burpees lol)

What exercises have you folks in similar positions found to be useful? HIIT? Running? 
Regardless, thank you in advance for any help! It’s much appreciated!
Can such developed back be achieved by training for climbing or it requires bodybuilding approach? Looking for a training advice to get into such shape
I want to make training videos that climbharder wants to watch. What do you want to see? &amp;#x200B;

Edit: For those of you that have been asking, here is my youtube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJYEYh3DRC4mwxTB3XIYY6Q](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJYEYh3DRC4mwxTB3XIYY6Q)

&amp;#x200B;

I've been making a few climbing videos on my youtube channel and want to make more training videos. I don't think there's nearly enough climbing content on Youtube and I'd like to change that, but I want to make sure I'm making stuff that the climbharder community wants to see.

I'm going to continue making videos about my own projects and competitions, and I'm planning a series following my own training for competitions and rock trips, but I'd also like to make more instructional videos about climbing training from my experiences of comp climbing over the last 10 years. To begin with likely topics will probably be hangboarding, campusing, ring work, board climbing etc.

But what else would you want to see? Technique drills? Mental training? Flexibility?? Is there anything you've been trying to learn about but can't find information about?

&amp;#x200B;
Open grip training for wrist pain Hey guys and gals, I've been hangboarding more lately and my prior finger issues (constant pain, some low level pulley injuries) have all but disappeared. 

However, now I'm noticing an increase in wrist pain, primarily from projecting some boulder problems outdoors. 

I've been doing reverse wrist curls, wrist hammer curls, and mobility stretching, as well as some forearm deep tissue massage, but the pain keeps coming back after every outdoor sesh just as intense as the last.

Open Crimp hangboarding should help to reduce the wrist pain as well, correct? I'm wondering if I should switch to only doing those during my hangboard sessions... Any ideas?

Do wrist extensor exercises from Eric Horst seen here help as well? https://trainingforclimbing.com/training-the-wrist-stabilizers/
Getting the most out of climbing non-projects. When looking at how I spend my time climbing, there is a large portion of my time that is spent climbing things that are below even my flash level whether it's for warming up, a break from a project, or what have you. It's easy when climbing these to just turn the brain off and cruise it without getting any real benefit from it. 

Do you guys have some ideas in mind when doing these easier problems to continue to improve? Are there ways that we can be using these easier problems or repeats of others to improve that they are better for than even the harder problems?
No-Drill Hangboard Mounting Solution Hey Everyone,

I am currently looking for ideas on how to mount a hangboard to a portable doorframe style pull up bar. The way our apartment doorframe molding is set up prevents us from drilling a standard mount. I know about the blank slate but have used them before with mediocre results, and it's not cheap. I was wondering if anyone on here knows an easy way to attach a hanboard (grindstone pro I think) to a pull-up bar with some modifications.
How did those 2018 goals go? What goals did you have, and how did you do on them? What progress have you seen in your climbing, even if it wasn't attached to a specific goal? (new hardest flashes, onsights, etc.) What did you do that you're proud of? What are your goals for next year?
2019 Goals Thread Really enjoyed reading through everyone’s 2018 goals and progress and since there hasn’t been one posted for 2019 I figured I’d get it started.

Square one climbing routine Just survived my hardest semester in undergrad gonna graduate in the spring! Though that being said I had absolutely no time to climb or even really train so I'm back at square one. I used to be able to lead some 5.11s out in Colorado and crush most 5.10s but now I barely got up a 5.9 in a gym. I have a hang board but I feel too weak to do my old routines. Any suggestions on a workout schedule to get me back to it? I also have a hang board and access to a climbing and regular gym
I'm building a training app. Please help by answering some questions! I'm currently creating a app which will create training programs. It will ask the user about themselves, what they want to train and for how long, then pick appropriate drills from a database to generate a training program. Then it will walk the user through the program, and serve as a logbook-like checklist to mark off what they have done.

If you could weigh in on some questions here it would really help me out:

1. What's your favorite training app any why?
2. Does it do something that other apps don't?
3. Do you wish it did something that it currently can't?
4. How does it make money and why is that good/bad? (such as ads, it was a paid app, app was free but you paid for its full functionality or removal of ads)
5. Would you prefer it to have a different strategy to make money? I currently plan on having it free to download with ads, and an in-app purchase to remove them permanently.
6. What's a huge no-no which would prevent you from downloading an app, or instantly uninstalling after opening it for the first time?

Advice: Training for short female climber Hi hello!

**TLDR: I'm short and weak and need a workout regimen that will help me be less short and less weak**

I'm looking for a training routine to increase my max grade both indoors and outdoors (mostly bouldering). I've been climbing about 3 years (off-and-on due to a broken ankle, other health issues, and a recent surgery on a broken finger). I'm about 110 pounds and 5'4" and I currently climb around V6-V7ish indoors and around V3-V5 outdoors.

I'm looking to really bump up my climbing this upcoming year and want some help crafting a training regimen for both on and off days. Right now, I climb about 3-4 times a week but with no real training in mind. Beyond that, I'll sometimes do some sit ups and pull ups if I'm feeling extra motivated.

Currently, I'm running into some walls with powerful movements, dynos, and things that require core strength. I also really struggle with reach-y climbs because of my height and my inclination towards more static climbing. Finger strength wise, I'm decent, but in terms of the rest of my strength I'm very weak- I have trouble standing up on high feet and pulling in/locking off on holds.

Because I've never really trained before, I'm struggling to come up with regimen. From the reading I've done, I've heard wide grip lat pulldowns are useful for short climbers and I also feel like I should be incorporating some squats as my lower body has minimal power. **Was hoping some of you would have some advice or training guides that would be worth incorporating into my week!**

Edit: Thank you for all the suggestions! I have a good list of things to work on from strength, to flexibility, to technique, and mental game. Seriously appreciate the help!

Edit 2: I seem to have started a big debate around calling myself short. I just wanted to clarify since my wording was pretty shit, I'm not saying that I can't do these climbs because I'm short, I was more so trying to highlight the movements that I'm struggling with. Of course being ~~short~~ not tall doesn't mean I can't climb hard, but I felt there were likely things that I need to concentrate on that maybe a 5'11" climber wouldn't have to focus on a much. (I climb with tall people and where I struggle on a certain climb is 100% not where they struggle- so I figured pointing out my height would help with training ideas) Also, technique is something I am always concentrated on and I'm not implying that that cannot be improved because it for sure can and I'm open for ideas on training that as well. I guess what I'm trying to get at is I'm not trying to use being shorter as an excuse, I'm specifically trying to work past my weaknesses whether that be in strength or technique and was looking for help.

BFR for increasing Aerobic Capacity. As of late, Ive been hearing more about Dr. Tyler Nelson. One form of training he advocates for is Blood Flow Restriction training. The aim is to reduce blood flow to and from the forearms in order to congest capillary beds--"creating similar conditions to high intensity exercise". This creates more acidic and hypoxic conditions in thr muscles, which promotes activation of intrinsic volume sensors that stimulate hormonal responses. This is useful for rehabbing, and training without high intensity.

Now, this is on the fringe of sports science, especially as it pertains to climbing--but I want to know if BFR can increase aerobic capacity through either long term restriction or intermittant restriction.

Certain hormones which encourage capillary growth are released in cells that dont receive enough oxygen. With aerobic training in mind (low intensity long term training), can BFR achieve the same if not greater effect with extremely low intensity and restriction?
Most important stretches As my most important new years resolution is to get more flexible, I want to stretch every day. 
My previous experience were, that if my stretching routine was too long, I simply wouldn't do it.

So now im looking for 3-5 lowerbody stretches, which I can each hold for 2 mins ( as Adam Ondra and Klaus Isele suggest), that I can do every day.

Which one do you think are the most important ones for this kind of short routine?
Finger injury prevention? So I got back into climbing after like a 3 year hiatus in September (had shoulder surgery at the end of 2015 and had to take a long time off)  I'm 19 now and I'm only climbing 5.11bs and 5.11cs TR and V3-V4 right now but I seem to keep injuring my fingers and I can't figure out why. this never happened when I was climbing before 3 years ago even though I was climbing harder routes and also doing more difficult 11s lead. Is there any reason for this? Is there any good way to prevent these finger injuries from occuring in the future?
Recording myself climb So reading through most of the posts here I see a lot of people talking about recording themselves climbing and how beneficial it is. I'm thinking of doing this and want to get the most out of it. So what am I looking for after I've climbed and reviewing footage? Should I be climbing grades at my limit or lower ones and consentrating on technique? Is it preferable to do that with all of my routes? Any advice would be great. Is there anything else I can do to really help technique improve, as well as the recording?

Thanks in advance.

Does anyone have recommendations for problems similar to this one on the tension board? I’ve noticed that I have a weakness keeping the tension on a small foot when its out to the side of me and I have to weight it instead of it being underneath me. Anything in the v6-v9 range would be cool thanks!
Training toward one arm pull up One of my goals for 2019 is to do a 1 arm pull up.  Ive been working pull up strength in general, offset pull ups and one arm lock offs.  What else can I do to progress toward that goal.
Can an A.I. generate Moonboard problems? Hello /r/climbharder!

I'm a student doing thesis work for my bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence, and a beginning climber. I was wondering whether I could construct an A.I. that can autonomously generate boulder routes, so I tried!

My program has generated a number of Moonboard problems, and now I want to get some feedback on how well it performs. Are the generated problems just as hard as normal problems? Just as fun?

If you think you're skilled enough to spot (or feel) the difference between real and generated routes, why not help me out? I made a survey containing 10 problems, some of which are generated. It would help me a great deal with my research.

My training app is finished!! "Climbing Coach - The Personal Trainer" Hey guys a while back I asked some questions about your favorite training apps. What they do that you like, what other apps do that you don't like. Based on that feedback, I've decided to remove ads and special permissions entirely from the app (it's Android only, sorry iPhone users). This means it's completely offline with no special permissions, but has the upfront fee of $2.30 CAD.

&amp;#x200B;

It's finally finished, here is the app description and the google play store link:

&amp;#x200B;

[Climbing Coach on Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adamson.miles.climbingtrainer)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Climbing Coach - The Personal Trainer requires no special permissions, has no ads and no subscription fees. It does not even require internet - the exercise database comes with the initial download.  
&gt;  
&gt;The app has a database of over 100 climbing exercises, for anything climbing related: volume, strength, power, power endurance, endurance and conditioning. They are categorized by type, difficulty and the equipment required. After you enter what type of training program you want, what days you want to train, the grade you climb and what equipment you have available, it creates you a personalized training program.  
&gt;  
&gt;In your program, you will be able to see every training day created and its exercises. Tap on an exercise to load the exercises information into a timer and set/rep counter. There is no need to switch to a stopwatch app!  
&gt;  
&gt;If an exercise turns out to be too easy or difficult, tap and hold on its button to switch it out for any other exercise. Most exercises have different tiers of difficulty, so you can easily swap it out for a higher or lower tier. You can also create your own exercises.  
&gt;  
&gt;Climbing Coach comes with full offline access to its drills and 15 detailed training tips. The training tips tell you why to train different things, and in what order. There are also tips on preventing injury, such as proper hangboard form and signs of overtraining.

&amp;#x200B;

My background as a climber:

&amp;#x200B;

I've been climbing since I was 6. I am 25 now. For almost all of that time, I have been training either on a Junior Team for competitions or individually for rock. I also have experience coaching Junior teams now that I'm older. I have coached Junior teams at two different gyms, and also helped design the program for a third. This app is my 15+ years knowledge of training drills and training cycles.

&amp;#x200B;

I have in depth knowledge of how to structure a program, what should be trained when, and what drills to then fill out a training program will. This knowledge I programmed into an algorithm, that generates a training program by pulling exercises strategically (based on your input of desire, grade, equipment ect) from its database. ALL exercises I wrote or adapted heavily myself, apart from a couple Metolius hangboard routines which they gave me written permission to use.

&amp;#x200B;

This app took me several months of work, and I'm dedicated to it. Hopefully people like it, and don't have any issues/crashes. I fixed everything my beta testers found wrong, and can't seem to make it crash on any emulator device. Still, please let me know if something is wrong and I can probably fix it in a day or two (especially if you DM me your device and what happened when it crashed).

Trouble Sleeping After an Intense Workout? After a particularly intense workout, usually using the campus board, weightlifting, or serious limit bouldering, I have trouble falling asleep. I feel very restless, achy, and just kind of worked up. It usually takes at least several hours to fall asleep. It's worse the closer I workout to bedtime but it still happens if I work out in the late morning. I have been training for almost 10 years and this has always been somewhat of an issue but I really want to fix it this training cycle. Anyone have any experience with this? Any remedies that have worked for you? Thanks y'all!
iPhone/iPad Training App, what do you think? Hi everyone, a few days ago I saw /u/Miles_Adamson post about his cool training app for Android, and a lot of people mentioned it would be good to have an iOS version. I guess that's a good cue to mention my project - ClimbingCoach. I'd previously hesitated about posting this, but seeing as people we're keen for an iOS version, and the specification of the two apps is pretty similar, here goes:

&amp;#x200B;

BACKGROUND

I wanted a training app that generated the plan, organised the training, and did all the timers you'd need, as well as recording progress and comparing it to others to assess strengths / training opportunities.

I've been working full-time on this project for almost a year, done a lot of testing, and am really happy with it.

The app considers climbers abilities and preferences, available equipment, training goals, and time constraints, and produces a personalised plan from a library of over 100 protocols, selecting the most appropriate for the individual.

&amp;#x200B;

WHO'S IT FOR?

Anyone really, although mostly beginners through to intermediate. I believe if you're just getting into training or want to get more serious about it, this app could be a good starting point for you - it basically does everything and has a number of safety measures to avoid overtraining (very important for the new climbers of course). If you're advanced, or just prefer the personal touch then I'd advocate chatting with your local trainer instead - Not to say that ClimbingCoach doesn't cater for advanced climbers, its more that the specific areas for focus that develop in more experienced are better handled in person.

Basically I see this as an option for those who are overwhelmed by the available literature and training options, want to train, and want something cheaper than a personal coach.

&amp;#x200B;

WHY AM I POSTING THIS?

A year ago I had a crazy dream that if I could make this project work, I'd get more freedom to do what I love, on my own schedule - climb! I quit my comfy job and got to work. So I guess this is a promotion, but I'm also genuinely interested in peoples opinions on the very concept of trusting a program to generate and manage your training plan, which feels controversial to me, and I'd expect people to have reservations about it?

&amp;#x200B;

WHAT QUALIFIES THE APP TO PRESCRIBE TRAINING?

It contains all of the knowledge and logic for writing training plans that I've built up over the last 9 years since I started climbing, all of the experience I've picked up along the way, books and papers I've read, mistakes I've learned from, and all of the little details that I'm liable to forget. It's consistent, suggests appropriate protocols, and still leaves quite a bit of control over the difficulty level, if you want to tweak it. It's also well tested by now, with a few psyched customers having been in touch to talk about features.

&amp;#x200B;

You can have a look [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/climbingcoach-training/id1434072318)

It starts with a 10 day free trial, but if you email me at [simon@climbingcoach.app](mailto:simon@climbingcoach.app) I'll send you a promo code for an additional 30 days free use.

Hope you like it

EDIT: forgot to say I'm happy to answer any questions etc, I'm not just dropping this here and forgetting about it.
Drills and training for footwork on overhangs Hello,

I've been climbing for about a year and a half infrequently, but this year I am committed to forming a real training plan. I currently boulder v3/4 and I want to get to v5/6.  

I've identified a big weakness of mine is that it feels like my feet just aren't helping me any on overhanging walls, so I want to focus on training that first.

Here are the drills I plan to do on the system wall.

1) hold onto jugs. start with high feet and work feet downward as far as possible without cutting loose.

2) place feet on good holds. work hands up as far as possible without cutting. repeat with worse feet.

3) hold onto jugs. cut feet and bring them back to the same place. cut feet and bring them back to higher/lower place.

4) climb easy routes (v1/2) but only use slopy or small feet

5) traverse using only the starting foot chips

are there any other drills or off the wall training exercises you all would suggest to help train this weekness?

thanks!
New study identifies the most effective mental strategies that people use to get through doing things they dislike - thinking about the positive consequences of getting to the end; monitoring one’s goal progress; thinking that the end is near; and emotion regulation (trying to stay in a good mood).
Footwork and actually taking the weight off your hands I feel as though my footwork is half decent. I know I can turn into the wall more and drop knee more often but the biggest thing is that I don't feel like I'm actually taking that much weight of my hands. Im aware of doing problems with arms straight the whole time of hovering over a hold for a few seconds before latching on. 

&amp;#x200B;

My buddy has pointed it out to me before that my foot will slip and ill hardly move because so much weight is just being pulled.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been trying to focus on keeping my arms straight but I often don't notice as I have a strong upper body( + 70% bw pull up)

&amp;#x200B;

anyways if anyone has any tips or videos of drills.
Give me some solid feedback this is the best attempt after trying all night. I panic and forget where my feet go the last half every time. Thanks for the help and advice!
GitHub repo for resources? Wondering if any had been started or if anyone wants to help contribute to one. I think it would be useful to just have a master repository with tons of resources for people who just want to learn more about really anything in training for climbing. Thoughts?    
    
Edit: if you want to contribute, shoot me a DM and I’ll send a link to the repo I just started. It ain’t much yet but it’s a skeleton we can begin to fill. I would like to kind of standardize how resources are formatted though, so don’t go crazy.
Comparison of performance metrics https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30300025

From elite cyclists, but relevant given people are rushing out to buy strain gauges after the recent TBP episode:

**TL;DR- Of all internal metrics (feelings, HR, physiological measures of stress), rate of perceived exertion correlated best to external measures of session stress.**

[Outside Online explains it](https://www.outsideonline.com/2356056/most-valuable-training-data-surprisingly-simple) 

My guess is this is also a trait elite athletes have that non-elites don't: an acute self awareness of exactly how hard something is
Bouldering while Exercising Every Day To provide some backstory I typically climb at my rock gym around once every 2 or three days, depending on how my fingers feel. I love climbing, and I would do it every day if I knew it wouldn't destroy me. I've been climbing for almost two years, but have only barely broke into V4's due to being quite overweight. On top of that, I'm dealing with depression which can make things tough. I've been talking with a therapist who is strongly pushing me to work out every day in order to boost my mood.

So, how would I go about working out every day while climbing? I don't want to overwork myself and be too tired/weak for climbing, since I know rest is very important. So what kind of exercises could I be doing on my non-climbing days that will still get my heart rate going? And is there a limit as to how hard I should push myself?

Any help would be much appreciated!
Endurance issues I am a fairly strong boulder at v6-7 in a gym and v5/6 outside. However, I’m only leading 5.11a both in rock and plastic. I can pull the moves on a 5.12 only falling once on top rope, but tend to pump out and fall on 5.11b’s quite frequently. Should I be focusing more on aerobic endurance? Doing ARC sets at well below my limit (say, 5.9)? Or will I get as much benefit spending more time on power endurance? I much prefer power endurance training and have been climbing both outdoors and in the gym for almost 3 years.
Tips for footwork outdoors? Hi climbharder,

I find footwork the hardest aspect of lead climbing outdoors. Anyone have any outdoor specific tips? For background my reliable onsight grade is 5.10c outdoors and I boulder around v5/v6.

Issues I have are:

1. Choosing footholds, how do I spot the best ones to use? Often I spend alot of time testing footholds, and when I'm pulling on crimps this depletes alot of my endurance. It seems like when I watch videos of pros, they just know the best footwork sequences already on their onsight attempts.

2. Do people just kinda smear alot outside? Alot of the footholds I find outdoors are quite slanted so you kinda have to half edge/half smear, which I find terrifying. I am fine with using microedges for feet until they become smeary. Alot of the time I will opt for a highfoot on a better foot +lockoff just to avoid these footholds. Does everyone just do the half edge/half smear?

3. Indoors, Ive encountered almost every foothold so I know what the texture is like, where the sweet spot is, and generally trust the foot quite easily. Outdoors how do I get used to trusting footholds where each one is a new encounter?

Appreciate any advice/thoughts people might have.
Technique Thread Often on climbharder we discuss strength metrics and plans but ignore technique because its a difficult and abstract thing. It seems like most people assume technique "happens" and we process movement internally, making it hard to describe. 

So lets discuss the finer points of technique, break things down and build on collective knowledge.
Muscle memory discovery ends 'use it or lose it' dogma - "New research shows that extra nuclei gained during exercise persist even after a muscle shrinks from disuse, disease or aging -- and can be mobilized rapidly to facilitate bigger gains on retraining"
I don't know what a good "climber's diet" is. I want to eat healthier to improve my climbing and health, but not sure what to get Hello r/climbharder

I just turned 23 yesterday and my goal for my next year of life is to eat healthier and improve my climbing. My diet right now is 90% pasta, pizza, and fast food. I am one of those people who look in decent shape because of a high metabolism, but in reality I have no endurance and my stamina is depleted after about 2 hard bouldering moves. I can not hang on krimps with serious struggle.

Anyways,
What foods should I include in my daily diet?
Any specific things to put on my weekly grocery list?
Are there meals that I can buy/make for cheap in bulk? I am a college student so eating a lot for minimal price is ideal 


Thank you for the advice!
When does it make sense to hangboard / campus INSTEAD of boulder? Looking on social media, it seems like a lot of strong climbers spend a pretty significant amount of time campusing. How many of you guys go into the gym and spend a significant portion of your session in the training room?

Is this something that starts making sense at the v10+ level where most gyms just don't set problems hard enough so you're forced to find a spray wall or campus board? Or does this also make sense for people still climbing in the single digits? 

For context: I've been climbing for 10yrs, usually flash v6 / send v8 in a session. My normal routine is to warm up, session some hard problems (try and link a handful of hard moves) and then back off to slabby/technique stuff when I'm no longer making progress. I'm definitely seeing incremental progress but am wondering if it's worth switching up my routine.
Unilateral strength aka wide lock offs Hey y’all. So I’ve scoured through this sub and can’t locate any posts relating to my particular weakness. First, I’m plenty strong (caveat: for my age/gender, a 43 year old female). I can do weighted pull-ups. I’m just super mega weak on doing wide lockoffs. If my hands are within my shoulders’ width, it’s no problem. It’s when both hands are out side that range where I find a precipitous drop in strength. I’m a bit on the lanky side so not built like these compact types with short biceps. I’m tall-ish, at 5’9. 

Any tips/advice would be appreciated.
Hangboarding Benchmarks and What The Pros Hang? So I was recently browsing Google trying to find answers to these two questions that I had. First, what are some benchmarks in hangboarding that are fairly good indicators of strength in comparison to climbers of a certain level? Second, what kind of weight can pro climbers (8b+/V14 and up) hang and on what edge sizes? 
I couldn't find a single thing on either of these besides the list of workouts on the beast maker app, but those are full workouts that primarily involve long sets of repeaters which would greatly favour sport climbers and endurance beasts (which is not what I am interested in). I know that hangboard figures don't directly translate to climbing grades so this question is more for my curiosity than for any real purpose. The question about the pro climbers is mainly because I know a lot of people that climb in the V12ish range and I know what they do, but I have no idea what the finger strength gods of climbing can pull, so I would be interested to find out!
Newbie question to prevent injury Hey all,

I just decided to get back into climbing after a 12 year hiatus. Currently in week 3, I'm a fairly good athlete, but that doesn't always translate into being a climber.  Anyways, currently I'm trying to climb as much as possible but I feel like I get finger tired so quickly.  The advice I hear about this is "just climb more" and "listen to your body" and "rest more, that's when you get stronger".  So this is pretty contradictory and I'm not sure what advice I should listen to.

- currently I will climb on auto belays for about 5 routes before my forearms are pimped and I can't stay on the wall anymore.
- I can get up 5.9s in the gym but anything more grip heavy it's not really close.

I plan on trying to climb as much as I can and some days I was thinking of doing two a days, with a full rest day after where I would do plyometrics or yoga. This would be two hour long sessions about,  and because I don't really have a climbing partner I don't rest too much between climbs. Is this too much, totally of base?

Thanks for any help or guidance. I'm open to good books or anything else like that.
Keeping in climbing shape with broken leg I broke my right fibula at a bouldering comp last weekend. Luckily it was a minor fracture so I can already walk with a boot on. Should be a fast recovery but no bouldering for 2-3 months. I haven’t done much hang boarding yet cause I’ve only been climbing for a year or so. However I wanna start some to keep my fingers strong while I’m away from. My doctor said I can also lift weights no problem in the meantime. Any extra advice for keeping in climbing shape? Thanks.
Favorite stretches What are your favorite stretches for

Review of my 2018 Training Logs 2018 is the second year that I’ve logged an entire year of training, so since the main benefit of logging is so you can look back and see what is going well, and what could be improved, here is my 2018 Training Log Review.

Last time I did a big review, I feel like I had a lot of numbers to share that described increases in strength, and then had sends to demonstrate that it was effective. This year I feel like I have a lot fewer gym-strong numbers for getting stronger, but instead have a long list of sends that are the reason I got better and stronger. I attribute a lot of that to a shift in how I approach my training, where I try to spend as little time as possible off the wall, and as much time on the wall. In addition, then things I was doing off the wall are hard to assign numbers, so it’s not nearly as pretty as in the past. I’ve done my best, and hope these make sense in showing my progress throughout 2018, as well as how it’s helped me inform my plans for 2019.

I'd love to hear feedback on how much sense this review makes, and if there's any other data that you would like to see around a training log review!

#2018 Goals:

- V8 x 2: 

- V7 x 4: 

- Pyramid to support these: 

- 5.12d: 

- Full 5.12 pyramid to support: 

- OAP: 

- RP whole gym set: 

- Drop under 200lbs BW: 

- +90lbs for 10s on 18mm edge: 

- Front Lever: 

#2018 Training:

- Total Cycles: 10.

- Total training session: 85. Not including “odd, deload, or fun/social sessions”

#Benchmarks:

- Finger Strength: Jan 8th, 2018: Max hang was +60lbs on 18mm edge for 10 seconds. Oct 1st, 2018: Max hang was +95lbs on 20mm edge for 7 seconds (probably could have held 8-10 second fwiw). Overall, I performed 35 hangboard session, with at least 3 repeater sessions

- Pulling Strength: Not too much significant benchmarks to start with. I’ve been capable of +50% BW pullup for a while, and still haven’t pulled significantly more than that, but had never done a OAP before. I started training this, and between weight loss, shoulder stability training, and being fresh, I was eventually able to pull one out. I repeated the feat a number of times, but it’s still a rare thing. 

- Climbing level: https://www.8a.nu/scorecard/nicholas-cornejo/boulders/2018 Started the year off with 1 V8 completed at the very end of 2017. Did a second one the first week of 2018, but didn’t get another V8 until November. In that time, I did managed a perfect #tallnotstrong V10 send. At the end of the year I sent 6 V8’s in 5 weeks, and got my first V9 in December. As for the pyramid, the highlights were getting 3 V7’s and 10 V6’s over the summer/ with trash conditions. 
I also did a lot of sport climbing: https://www.8a.nu/scorecard/nicholas-cornejo/routes/2018 Had done 1 5.12b in the past, and had a very sparse card coming into the year. Finished the year with a full 5.12 pyramid, and two grade increase (5.12c and 5.12d). Most of the routes I sent still fell into the “bouldery” category, but did get a couple that were a little more power endurance. The majority of my sends were in the middle of the summer (April to October) during one of the wettest years on record, so I feel I did pretty well regardless. 

- Consistency: Aimed for 4 days of climbing per week, and I was right on the nose pretty much all year. My general schedule was 3 days in the gym, and one outside each week, which worked well. Towards the end of the year, I was able to get outside a lot more, and started averaging 3-4 days outside each week, and was only in the gym a handful of times from November until January. Additional exercise weren’t perfect, but I think I averaged 2 days a week working core, a push, or a pull movement on top of climbing. These extra things were dropped a couple times after various slight tweaks.

#Things I changed this year:

- Hangboarding: Stopped hangboarding as an official part of every training session. I now reserve it to testing finger strength, and for when my training resources are limited. I want to say that no one should use it, but I think there is a more balanced approach, but for me, at the moment, I don’t feel like I’m missing much from not using it religiously. I feel confident that I can get to V11 by becoming a better climber, and letting small holds on boulders be my finger strength training.

- Training cycle length: Most of my cycles have been 4 weeks, so 3 on, 1 deload, repeat. I experimented with 5 week cycles because I realized that I was often peaking performance wise every 5 weeks or so. I wound up switching back to 4 week cycles because they feel easier to manage logistically, but also because I felt like it might be a little too much with the volume/intensity that I was training at.

- Sport climbing season: Focused specifically on sport climbing training, and was much better at sticking with the plan than I had in the past. Switching from boulders to ropes was challenging because I was intimidated by sport climbing, and because it was really hard to drag myself from good conditions and friends. Transitioning back to bouldering was a little easier, because I was highly motivated for it, but slightly frustrating because I saw a really apparent drop in power and tension that I hadn’t expected. Turns out getting mentally ready for The Red doesn’t prepare you to do single, hard explosive moves!

- Weight loss: This is something that I’ve never taken seriously before. I’ve always wanted to be lighter, but it finally felt like low-hanging fruit for continued improvement. I started the year at ~210lbs give or take a few pounds. I started weighing myself consistently, and watching where I was consuming my calories when I weighed in at 212lbs. It took 4-6 months to drop below 200lbs, but I eventually reached my goal, and was able to stick with it down to 195lbs, where I decided to level off and try to really get into performance mode. Doing this convinced me how much an impact weight loss can have, It also confirmed that I could get stronger at the same time, and that it wasn’t the biggest/only factor in climbing performance. 

#Lessons Learned:

- Climbing needs to take center stage in my training. Pulling and hanging should be reduced or removed depending on the intensity and availability of appropriate climbing.

- Sending new boulders/routes is crucial for continued development and improvement. Projecting hard routes feels like a good use of time, but it’s only useful if you are learning something on every session or even every attempt. Going out and getting lots of sends in will build the base for those harder climbs, will give you the time under tension to get stronger, and will teach you the mental process of working things that are challenging so you get better and executing on them, instead of just wiring one route into submission.

- Sport climbing is still a beast that I struggle with. Also that being strong and powerful from bouldering makes me feel a lot better on the rope than if I focus too much on endurance. Probably better said as, “Don’t let power and tension drop if you are focused on sport climbing, since doing hard move requires good body connection and strength”.

- Volume is the easiest thing to modulate to increase or decrease the chance of injury.
 
- Flexibility training is actually very useful.

#How I did with logging:

- Ease of reviewing: Not super easy. I included a lot of junk knowledge that I don’t really care about. I don’t always use the same names for different workouts or segments, which made it slightly challenging to review what I did long term.

- Structure of logs: OK. It makes sense to me for the most part, but is still probably still too complex/wordy

- What could be Improved? Use a template. Make sure there is a dedicated space for things I try out or change between workouts or cycles. A more effective way of tracking volume or intensity other than time spent in the gym.



What my next log is going to look like: I’d love to get feedback on this template for a training log. This is what I’m using at the moment, and I feel like it covers most things, but could probably use more info.

Need advice for pushing past fear Hi everyone. i need some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been bouldering off and on for the past few years. I've never really exceeded the occasional V2-3 and have had to fall back to the V0/V1 range every time I take time off. I'm 42 and 170 lbs, I do yoga, and my fitness is pretty good overall.  


I recently committed to climbing more and finally met a partner to climb with. We climb every morning at 6:30 for about an hour. As he is a seasoned climber he has been encouraging me to top rope with him. However, I have always had a bad fear of heights and, at first, I would get really nervous when I would get above 20-30' on a rope climb. Over time, this feeling has diminished but I still can't climb 5.8-5.9 without resting on the rope. The visceral fear isn't there like it was but this has to be a heights thing as I don't feel this way while bouldering. My hands feel like they're going to "let go" at any time, I sweat, my forearms are pumped out like crazy, and my decision making gets foggy. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I've been climbing almost every weekday for almost 6 months I'm getting pretty sick of this. I'm now discouraged to the point where I'm considering quitting but this makes me really sad. I love the mountains and really enjoy climbing and would love to push through this but I'm stumped at how to move forward. I've contacted the training folks at my gym to see what they have to say but I thought I'd reach out here as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!
6 month Lattice Training Reassessment/Update **Please see original assessment thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/8yc5y1/my_lattice_assessment_results/)**

________
**Climbing Progression**
Below is my route pyramid before/**after**

V5: 15, **32**

V6: 4, **17 including a flash**

V7: 1, **8, 9 if you count a 7 that I thought was a 6 pre-Lattice. 2 in a single session**

I'm fairly close on some 8's, but weather on my last Bishop trip and local weather recently haven't been super cooperative. I am supposed to go back to Bishop this month if things cooperate and was achingly close on quite a few projects there as well as a couple 9's. I have not sport climbed much during the program just due to logistics, but my wife is taking her lead test this weekend and eventually I might trust her not to deck me. I don't have life insurance, so hopefully she has no incentive to do so.

Gym wise my climbing is roughly the same, but I flash 6's and send 7's at a slightly higher rate. TBH I've done almost zero gym projecting not on a woodie, Kilter, or Tension Board.

Almost all of my projecting and hard climbing has been outside. I climbed outside weekly while on the program from Sept-Dec including several weekend trips as well as a 10 day trip to Bishop. 

______
**Assessment results before/after**

Shoulder mobility: great/**great**

Front lever: Position 2, knees bent at 90: Very good/ **Position 3 1 knee bent at 90 the other straight out**

Trunk Stability: Position 2, hands in line with chin/**Position 3, hands in line with forehead**

Hollow hold: 68 secs/ **90sec and I could have kept going**

Pull 2RM:BW+65lbs, or 239lbs (BW 174)/**BW+77.5, or 244.5 (BW 167)**

Max reps Pull: 18/**15** Not sure what happened here. It was weird.

Max reps push: 31/**35**, closer to the gold standard of 40

HC Max: BW-35/37.5/**BW-22.5/-22.5 or a 7% normalized increase** Back in the original assessment they said my normalized finger strength was OK for V7 and a 3.5% yearly increase would be really good.  I was able to go way above and beyond this and, at 87% am above what they feel is necessary for V10.

OH Max: BW-40/42.5/**BW-30/30** Still not a concern as it is pretty close.

Anaerobic capacity @60%: 81sec/**88sec** Apparently it jumped from 20% to 46%, which is great for bouldering, but too high for sport. This is where their modeling comes into play and I do not know how the percentages are derived.

Aerobic capacity @60%: 91sec/**94 sec**. The key here is that my aerobic contribution improved to 23.5%, which puts me "close to the fittest sport climbers". This is one of the proprietary metrics I don't think I have insight into.

Lactate curve: 91, 63 ,:46, :45, :36, :34, :27, :27: Decay rate is on the high side, but lower end is not bad considering how long I have been climbing. **Don't recall my times, but the decay rate has dramatically improved" This indicates higher base fitness, recovery between attempts, etc. I have noticed this a bit across big days outside.

____

**Conclusions**

I can't rule out my climbing age and simply getting more climbing time as a factor in success, however, I can say that I have sent more stuff and that many things I had sent before or were projects are now warm-ups that I never miss. I haven't encountered many climbs that I am not physically fit enough for, which in the past was a limiter on a few problems, which is probably an important lesson in the continued importance of technique and route reading.

What I can say has improved is the depth and breadth of problems I have done. In the same day in Bishop I did The Hulk in 3 tries, then drove to the Milks and flashed Smooth Shrimp and sent Green Wall Center. I feel that these are dramatically different problems. Locally there was a day where I went to Castle Rock and dispatched Dark Side of The Moon and Tree Problem (famously sandbagged 4), which a few months prior were not possible.

I also lost 7lbs although at one point during the program I feel my weight loss stagnated progress, especially outdoors. I got as low as 164ish, which at my height (191cm) and bodyfat just isn't advantageous.  I also was really awful at managing burns and skin outside so many problems required me to come back to them or sends were limited by me just being a chuffer.

As for the workouts themselves I can't divulge the entire program but it went something like:

Base- Lots of hangboard, TRX, aerobic capacity, moderate anaerobic capacity, 1 day a week of 30-60min limit bouldering on a woodie.

With all that said I'm signed up for 3-6 more months and hopefully I send some shit.

Build- Lots of hangboard, more an cap less aero cap, slightly more hard bouldering time but mostly outside.

Perform- Maintenance energy systems work, same amount of hangboarding, much more projecting/hard climbing.
Length of climbing sessions I've heard about different approaches to lifting, for example, more reps less weight vs less reps more weight.  This got me thinking, does anyone know the pros/cons of longer climbing workouts (2-4hrs) a couple times a week vs shorter climbing workouts (1hr) let say 5-6 times a week.  I understand the concept of resting but if you aren't killing your body every workout is that more beneficial, not sure?  Anyone have some research or firsthand knowledge.  Thanks!
I’m looking for videos of climbers with exemplary smooth technique. This is a current favourite, it’s Luke Dawson climbing Brian 8c+ at Anstey’s cove in the South of UK.
Sufficient Rest Is Critical, Folks! Anecdotal Results Hi all, just wanted to share my anecdote on the importance of rest for the over-trainers out there hitting a wall..

Background: Just thought I would share a quick strength break- though. I'm 28/m/v7ish/10+ years climbing, and I've been training hard strictly for bouldering for the first time in about 6 years. Schedule was bouldering gym 4x a week, campusing 2x, and weight lifting once a week. While I did see some gains over the the first 4 months, the last 1.5 months I REALLY plateaued, and was frustrated.

Out of the blue I got strep throat last week, and was down for the count for 8 days. While "resting" I took the time to reset my diet and made it a light cut, dropped 4 pounds and let a lot of aches and pains recover.

Results: Well, I hit the gym worried I would have dropped off, but man I felt like I was floating! My projects that were simply too powerful before felt fairly easy and I cruised through many prior cruxes in the more dynamic overhung problems. It was a short first session back, but wow, giving proper recovery time to all the campusing and hard training I'd done gave me the results beyond what I was hoping for. I've had such bad tunnel recently I would often climb at limit, campus, rest overnight, and then be surprised I wasn't progressing the next day.

TLDR: Training hard is great, but give yourself plenty of time to recover. The results are worth it. Oh yeah, and get more sleep...

&amp;#x200B;
The Climbers Goal: Gain Strength while maintaining body weight I think most people rightly feel its very hard to gain strength while losing weight, but what are most peoples opinion on gaining strength while maintaining body weight and what is your nutritional approach to do so?

I'm about 6 feet tall and weigh about 158-160Lb on any given day. been climbing for about 2 years regularly. The last year has been pretty much a "just climb" mentality although over the last 4 weeks I started incorporating hangboarding and also over the last 8 weeks I started doing weighted pullups) - here are my results

* I have seen a 30% increase to the weight I  add for my max hang,
* a 24% increase to my edge dead hanging time at body weight,
* a 31% increase to the weight I add for a 5-rep pullup set,
* a 33% gain to the number of pullups I can do at body weight.

all while staying in the 158-160lb bodyweight range by using a calorie counting app and following a macro of 40%carbs 30%protein 30% fat.

So I have been gaining strength while maintaining body weight. I've heard many weightlifter/fitness types say that this is a really inefficient approach to gaining strength, but I can't help but think this common thinking might not apply to climbing.

First off, the primary strength increases climbers are looking for are in the finger flexors/forearms. this is much different than other sports which often focus on much larger muscle groups. just from a laymen's point of view, I can totally understand if your looking for large strength gains in your legs or back or chest that the most time effective way to do so will be to eat a lot and train while gaining weight then trim the fat later on a different cycle. But when your training goals are mainly prioritizing growing the finger flexors and forearms it makes since that your body can do this while maintaining a specific weight, its simple just an easier task energy wise

Secondly, many other sports view a gain in body weight as a positive thing (as long as body fat% is doesn't go up), while rock climbing generally sees weight gain as a negative (if your strength/weight ratio is lowering). So I feel a lot of sports/training "common knowledge" doesn't really apply to climbing

I guess i'm just trying to gauge the consensus of some climbing/training vet guys while starting a general discussion because i'm bored haha. Is trying to gain strength while maintaining body weight a reasonable long term training approach or will you eventually hit a wall and need to try the bulk and cut approach?
What made the difference for you in injury prevention? I’ve been injured pretty much constantly since starting climbing 6 years ago. I’ve now reduced my climbing twice a week, and I take weeks off here and there. I do physio exercises every couple days (usually after my climbs). Yet still
I’ve got tweaky shoulders, elbows, fingers, and more. I can’t get through a session without re-awakening an old injury. 

Anybody else got this issue ?
What's the relationship between building finger strength and endurance? I'm curious what people's experiences have been with training finger strength, and how that has consequently affected their endurance. I would think somewhat intuitively, if you're on a strength training hangboard routine and work up to v10 finger strength* from v5, then probably as a byproduct you'd bump up your route grade from 5.N to 5.N+2 just as a result of the individual moves being relatively trivial for your fancy new tendons. Is that a fair assumption? If so, to what extent does strength training affect your endurance? What has your experience been doing just max hangs? Just repeaters? Both? Looking forward to everyone's responses.

*grades are obviously arbitrary, just for illustrative purposes
How to figure out a boulder problem. I'm training in a gym which don't have a boulder problems made by a route setter. There are only walls with bunch of holds and you have to figure out/make/invent (i don't know how to call this) your own boulder problem and climb it. Can you give me an advice how to do this better in order to figure out some nice boulder problems near my project level. Thanks!
Have a pulley injury. Am depressed. How do I know when I can start training hard again? I have a pulley injury and I hadn't climbed much for about 4 months. I just went to the gym for the first time in a while to see how it feels and it wasn't terrible but my finger is definitely hurting afterward.

I went to a doctor who suggested taping it for support which would allow me to climb a bit (just not as hard as I used to). That's a nice option so I don't have to stop completely but will it prevent it from actually healing if I'm using it at all?

I was hoping to get some stories from all of you about treating injuries, how long it took to heal, and how much I can do with it in the meantime.
How important is flexibility in climbing? I’m lacking in it and wondering whether working on it may have a substantial benefit in my climbing Obviously it doesn’t hurt to work on it, but would this have a similar effect to working on strength. Will I notice a real difference in climbing?
What is the typical rock climber diet and how to lose weight if I'm broke? I've been climbing for about 3 years but have been taking it seriously since last September. Ive been climbing 2-3 times a week and if I cant make it to the rock gym at least 2x a week, I'll do a full body workout for about 2-3 hours at home. I have imrpoved drastically in my climbing but I still have a little bit of fat at the base of my stomach. I'm about 5'8" and weigh 150-155 lbs and kinda on the poorer side when it comes to money. I'd like to start a more strict diet just so I can be lighter when I climb but dont know what i need to do. Any tips? Thanks for the advice!

Edit: To go more in depth, I come from a filipino house hold so I eat about 2 scoops of white rice with whatever the main dish will consist of (ground beef with potatoes in a soy sauce marinade or a soup with green beans, okra and fish or beef, etc.) I eat usually two eggs with toast in the morning and once a week ill probably eat out. I drink about 5-6 liters of water a day and try my best to not eat fried foods.
Any pull-up training success stories? (or suggestions?) I've been climbing very casually for a couple years, but just got serious about learning technique, training, etc. in the last six months or so. I'm 5'10, 145 lbs, female, and climb 5.11. (I was around 5.9 six months ago, so learning good technique has been huge!) One of the most frustrating parts of training is my inability to do a single pull up, and I've been working toward them for months. Decent technique gets me through a lot of challenging moves, but I feel like the ability to muscle through a crux when necessary is a good back-up to have.

I climb 3-4x/week and do strength training targeting my upper body 2x/week (I also run about 20 miles/week so I don't see a huge need to do much lower body training). Strength training consists of lat rows, lat pull downs, negative pull ups, bicep/tricep work, inverted rows, and hangs. 

Has anyone else had to work really hard to achieve their first pull up? Any advice?

I didn't run into similar posts, but if there is one, feel free to direct me towards it.
Optimal Pinky Placement During Three Finger Drags? It's no secret that even if a finger isn't actively engaging on a hold its position can still affect how hard you can pull with your other fingers. Take the ring finger for example, because of the tendon structure of the hand it can be difficult to engage the ring finger without also engaging the middle finger and vice versa, which is why the ring/middle in a pocket can often feel more secure than middle/index. That aside, i'm wondering about the optimal placement of the pinky when it is inactive in a three finger drag position. Would it be best to rest it next to the hold unengaged, or curl it downwards? I notice on three finger drags the thumb often curls itself naturally, but what sort of pinky position is optimal for max contact strength on a hold?
For those who both lift and rock climb, what is your lifting routine? For those who both lift and rock climb, what is your lifting routine? I want to know what other people who both lift and climb do for a lifting routine. Do you do any specialized weight training or emphasis certain muscle groups?
Training body tension - not core strength itself, but applying it to maintaining tension while climbing. Hi all,

Climbing for about a year and this guy was an idiot, climbed too much, and hurt his finger. Well on the way to recovery, it seems, and I've been climbing for about a month mostly unhindered bar some odd moves/positions. In being injured, I've seem to have lost my footwork skills to a degree and now I'm noticing something else - not keeping body tension. 

Noticed this on an overhung route that has a throw up to left jug, step through with right foot, drive hips into the wall, push up and right to a crimp. Before, I feel like this move wouldn't have been THAT hard for me. Challenging maybe, but able to do it. I can't even stick it once now, though I am close. I keep falling away from the wall because it's almost like I'm so focused on the next hold that I 'forget' about my body. I also noticed this on a slab problem with feet that are rather small for me. 


I am in pretty decent shape, and have a strong core. I don't think that's really the issue. I think it's mental and/or I just now lack the technical skills to maintain the needed tension. That said, does anyone have suggestions for training to apply the core strength I currently have to maintaining tension on the wall? 

Thanks
Training with a physically demanding job. I work as a butcher and it involves a lot of heavy lifting and leaves me very tired after my shifts. My goals are to boulder outdoors at a higher level. I’ve changed my schedule around so I will work Monday-Thursday only. Friday-Sunday I want to be outside projecting 2 days. What should a training session look like on a day where I am fatigued from working?
Training for a multipitch crack climb in Yosemite? So I just moved to California and once Yosemite warms up I'm hoping to be there weekly. After talking with an experienced local, I decided that I want to do the rostrum before 2020! That's the final goal. At least leading a non pathetic number of the pitches. In the past I have climbed most in the east at the RRG. As far as difficultly goes, I have redpointed up to 12a there but the style of climbing is so different, being pumpy and largely over hung face climbing.

So the main crux of the challenge is getting used to the new landscape of route types as well as building endurance, since the north face route is 8 pitches of 5.10-5.11+. From the reading I've done on the route there are a couple pitches of off width, some hand cracks and some finger cracks. So it's got the whole spectrum. I think I'll struggle a bit on the OW, so if anyone has any OW technique resources that'd be really nice to read. Right now I can get up the hand crack at my gym which is a bit greasy, but probably only a 5.8/9. But I do feel improvements in crack technique after just a couple days. I am 6'5" 183lbs. I'm rehabbing a knee injury from December, so I can get back into calisthenics and supplementary core work. 

So right now I'm in relatively good shape, could be better, after mainly bouldering for the last few weeks. I've been doing primarily arc training this week to build up the endurance but I feel I could do more to train more efficiently. I'm wondering if, in addition to that, anyone has any route suggestions that will be good to practice technique/train on, any suggestions, or even anecdotal wisdom or beta! 

Thanks and happy climbing!
Dealing with the feeling you're getting worse Do you ever have days or weeks where you feel like you're getting weaker and/or worse at climbing?  In my last few gym sessions I haven't been able to repeat a couple of problems I did recently.  I haven't been stressed, overtraining, under-rested or sick.  And I didn't suddenly gain 20 lbs.

How do you deal with it, emotionally, when you feel like you suck and just want to give up?  Do you feel like perseverance through these down periods is part of what makes a successful athlete a successful athlete?
GTG pullups for climbing Sorry, this might be a really stupid post. Recently, I got the chance to talk to and climb with an elite(V14) climber at my gym for over an hour. This guy was an absolute monster, he campused the hardest routes in the gym(V10) in relatively few tries, and was doing crazy one arm campus dynos and stuff. Wondering how he got so strong, I inquired about his training, particularly the training he did as a teenager. He said that he never hangboarded until he got very strong(obtained finger strength just through climbing) and just greased the groove with pullups every single day so that he was doing hundreds of pullups a day. I asked him if he though this training was a good idea for me, and he asked how many clean pullups I could do. I said 22, and he siad "Oh. Oh. Yeah you need to work on that. Do you do pullups regularly?" At this point I was like "Lol, Ive been doing 5 sets of 10 pullups almost every other day for months as well as pullups to failure." I always though this training was a lot, and if I did more I would be overtraining. This is when he told me I should be doing 100+ pullups every day via greasing the groove method as my pulling strength was weak. This seemed kind of crazy to me, and I know I am not this dude, is this a valid, safe way to get stronger for climbing?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I have decided to hesitantly try this TO AN EXTENT(definitely not every day). I have really, really bad endurance and I hope this might help for ropes season. I talked to some climbers who know me, and they agree that recently as Ive been breaking into the v10 level most of the time I fall because I can't generate momentum for a throw and not because I slip of holds (need more pull power). I am planning to switch up my training so that I will be doing 10x10 pullups 2 times a week before climbing. I am also adding in a day of specific antagonist work to hopefully prevent injury more, and a day of a progressive overload weighted pullup program. It is worth noting, I used to do weighted pullups twice a week, but the past couple of weeks I haven't been doing any training at all(due to getting overly physched on sending a project Ive been trying for over a year) I think it is actually a good idea to amp up the pulling training right now as I am trying to limit hangboarding/finger training because I am a 15 year old right in the middle of a massive growth spurt(weak growth plates - I have gained nearly 20 lbs in the past few months) In regards to the GTG 10x10, I tried it for one day before climbing spread out through the day, and it felt fine, I was slightly weaker in climbing, but barely noticeable. Lastly, do you guys think technique/awareness can just be trained through climbing?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: I haven't climbed much recently, so Idk if it helps climbing, but after a couple days of training gtg I achieved my first one arm pullup. 🤷
Supplements in climbing Hi,

So I currently am on a quite full on training programme and as a result track my carb, protein and fat intake. To help reach my protein intake I now use whey protein. As well as this I have begun to take creatine (mainly as an experiment to see what happens).

I definitely feel that I recover faster and feel that I have more quality training and climbing sessions, though I'm not sure if this is placebo, me getting stronger or the supplements.

What are people's experiences with supplements, what do you find works and doesn't? I have also heard lucine is good but not tried it.
What is the physiological reasoning for getting pumped? The more detail the better.  

You can use logic and your knowledge of general physiology to make an argument.  I'm not that idiot who will attack you with a 'source?' comment.
Benefit to long dead hangs? Is there any reason to hang on a hangboard from relatively easy holds for extended periods of time? say 50 seconds then take a minute or two of rest and do this for say 10 reps?
Follow-up study sport and personality Hi r/climbharder,

We are scientists from the Ruhr-University in Bochum in Germany and as we were overwhelmed by your support of our study we posted here a few months ago, we would like to ask you for support again. We are currently doing another study on how athletes from different sports differ in their personality and well-being. 

It is quite similar to the previous one, but this time we don't ask how you would describe \*other\* athletes, but how would you describe \*yourself\*. At the end of the survey, you immediately get feedback about your personality profile.

Link to survey:

Feel free to share the link with other people of your/other sports!

If you have questions, leave them in the comments and we will try to answer them.

Thank you so much in advance!
Minimum microcrimp edge pull up We all know beastmakers 6mm. Not being able to buy them, I decided to make my own micros. I had only 4mm wide wood, so I made the edges using that. It took me a while, but I managed to hang them, and soon after, a pull up. Both using my thumbs on the side.

Here are the edges and deadhang: www.instagram.com/p/BteQZUIh5C4/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=tciifvfbtp84 

Here is the pull up: https://www.instagram.com/p/BuZem2vhp0I/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=cy7b0dqddl06

So that got mr thinking, 4mm is pretty fucking small, but could we go smaller? What is the smallest edge possible, that you reckon is hangable, and pullup-able?

Also, are there any benefits to training on this? I made it out of fun, but I'm curious do you think does it have any particular advantage over classic methods like campusing or 1cm edge. I know this relies heavily on skin, and conditions, so is it worth training on it?

Soon I'll make 3mm, and try that. Also, I'll make a better vid showing the measures and everything properly.

Hangboard Numbers In a fingerstrength thread that was posted a year ago I read something that I think about often: "Your fingers will always be the weakest link between you and the rock".

Here's a little number experiment Ive been working on that might be useful to people for comparison or to see just how much of a numbers game bouldering can be. This isnt to downplay technique or morphology, but numbers are fun.

My last session, I was pulling +72.5 lbs half crimp, on an 18mm edge.

Then, I used a crane-scale to test my one arm crimp pulling power as well.

Righthand: 109 lbs, Lefthand: 102.5 lbs (BW is 135)
The following Grippul study stated that pulling 80.7% on each arm on the no hang device equated to v8:
https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56830ef60ab377cb562da204/t/5abdc60f2b6a284e1a19db55/1522386455330/BF_strength_climbing_correlations-MAR282018_web.pdf

The study is pretty damn limited and ambiguous but It was interesting to see  my numbers in comparison... 109 lbs /135 lbs = 80.7%.

Also my MAW numbers predict i should pull approximately this much per arm: (72.5+135)/2= ~103.75 lbs. As you can see Im a bit imbalanced.

Its a nice little coincidence that it is exact. i encourage yall to measure yourselves and maybe post here when you can...  Im curious. The crane scale is a useful tool to see how warmed up you are for a proj. If I crane-test myself prior to projecting I should theorhetically be 100% recruitment and be the most physically prepared for a burn once i start seeing ~100 lbs.


The test:

18mm (One Pad) Edge. Max added weight, Strict halfcrimp. No bird beaking, No full crimping, No added side-finger friction. Hold for 10 seconds. The more strict we are with these tests the better. The surveys here are limited in peoples willingness to be honest or conduct a test properly.

P.S. At work, on my phone, if this is shitpost fringe thinking let me know bahaha.

Also, fun fact, according to lattice training--Alex Megos sits at 132% on each arm.
Hey everyone! A while back I made this Training Guide for some writing practice for another project and have been giving it out on a donation basis (AKA free!). The idea is to help people become self-sufficient in their training. Hope you like it!
Bridging Science and Climbing: The Beta Angel Project 2018 year in review (and thank you Reddit climbers!!!) Hi Reddit climbers,

I just wanted to say thank you for being one of the top sources that visits The Beta Angel Project.  I had no idea that Reddit would be the #3 referrer to my website at the end of 2018.  I didn't even have an account with Reddit prior to 2018.  I'm receiving a lot of feedback and have been doing my best to incorporate content and suggestions.  Here's just a fun look at some stats associated with the site.  Keep on bringing recommendations and I'll keep listening.

Obliged!
Recovering from ulnar wrist pain Just want to log my experience for anyone else that may be going through or wondering how to deal with ulnar wrist pain.

&amp;#x200B;

**Before the doctor**

I taped my left wrist for months while climbing. It always seemed to get my wrist back to "normal" as far as usage, and I was willing to tape since I didn't feel it was hindering me in any way. Certain movements would cause some pretty intense pain, but I would try to move past it as fast as possible while on the wall to find a position that didn't aggravate so much. Again, spent months like this.

At some point I was just going about my day and my wrist popped, and it hurt. You know how sometimes when you try to extend your arm, you elbow "catches" and you have to force it to pop? Same thing with my wrist, but it hurt more. I would get frustrated when I resistance, and would force it through instead of easing up on it. This may have made things worse, not sure. Reaching up to my steering wheel, brushing my teeth, these are the normal every day things that I would be suddenly reminded about the pain in my wrist. Sometimes I would wake up with my wrist feeling sore, like my wrist was in a poor position while sleeping, but not one that hurt enough to wake me up. I started not liking waking up just because of how obvious my wrist would hurt.

Before going to a doctor, I found a [wrist brace](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056PQV2K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that made my wrist feel much better. I have a feeling that this helped the healing process somewhat, but it was probably better help for my psyche. I didn't think about it as much and I spent less time worrying about it. This didn't change my taping habits - still did it every session.

&amp;#x200B;

**Visiting the doctor**

I scheduled an appointment when a doctor and had some x-rays taken, which didn't provide any useful information. Doctor gave me some ideas - could be something minor, could be a tear. If it was a tear, depending on the severity, I may need surgery.  That didn't do much for my mood, but they scheduled me to get an MRI the following week. Thankfully, my insurance is pretty decent so the MRI didn't cost too much. MRI came in and was told no tears, no lasting damage - just a wrist sprain. Good news to hear that it wasn't a tear, bad news that I went through all this trouble to find out it was a simple wrist sprain. Doctor said I should lay off all activity for 2-4 weeks. This was the worst part - as you may know, it's hard to not climb. I was a good boy though, I took two weeks off. 

&amp;#x200B;

**After the doctor**

My wrist did feel better after two weeks, but I felt like I was going stir crazy. I went climbing and for the most part everything felt better, and I started to worry that I'd just get back to the same place after climbing again. I went to see a physical therapist, which is what I wish I did in the first place. They recognized the sprain and did some myofascial release on my extensors, which relieved some pain immediately. They gave me a routine of stretching, massaging, and icing for my wrist/forearms that has been tremendously helpful. At the time of writing, my wrist still pops occasionally, but it is getting better. The funny part to me? Everything they gave me I read in Eric Horst's book "Training for Climbing". I just didn't think I needed to do it, as I wanted to focus on strength training for my fingers and forearms. Guess it was in there for a reason.

&amp;#x200B;

Two office co-pays and the price of x-rays and an MRI to tell me to sit around for a couple weeks. It's money I'd rather have in my pocket for such a simple diagnosis, but knowing is better than not knowing for me. 

Again, I just wanted to share my experience. I'm not plugging any particular wrist brace or type of physical therapy, nor is this information substitute for medical advice.

Pie in the sky trad climber looking to ditch the excuses and could use some help Me:

* Age: 29
* Height: 6'3"
* Weight: 200 lbs
* Location: Central Coast, CA
* Wife, one toddler, full-time office job
* Years climbing: 2 years, 3 months
* Total pitches climbed outdoors: 244
* Strengths: Technical knowledge (gear, systems, self-rescue skills, etc), cardio, technical slab climbing (up to low 5.10s), motivation to get outside/climb/cardio workouts
* Weaknesses: Strength- I'm very weak for my height and weight, core, balance, motivation for strength exercises, anxiety, over-planner, unrealistic expectations in ever facet of my life


**Trad:**

* 79 pitches led in 2018, (102 all time)

* Hardest onsight on gear: 5.8

* Hardest redpoint on gear: 5.9

* Hardest top rope clean: 5.10b/c 

**Bouldering:**


Gym: 

* V3s: Flash ~75% , ~20% within 2-3 tries
* Slab V4s: Flash ~25%, ~50% within 2-3 tries
* Steep V4s: Hands can't even hang onto any holds

Outside:

* V0s: Only managed to send a couple after half a dozen tries. Have only bouldered outside less than 5 times

Technical/gear skills: Solid. Have spent dozens and dozens of hours practicing all sorts of anchors, self-rescues, 

Cardio: Good, used to be phenomenal. I'm usually the one kicking all the hard climbers' butt on the long approaches in.

__________________________________________________________________________

Outdoor time: About once a week with my trad mentor. 

Partners: I owe my trad mentor everything for taking the time to put me under his tutelage. Unfortunately, he's 65 and is only good for two or three climbs before calling it for the day. He likes to stay below 5.9 for most of his climbs. Even when we've taken trips together out to Tollhouse and Tahquitz he's really only good for a few climbs for the entire day. It's a bit of a bummer and a lot of time is wasted I find but I can't stop climbing with him. I'm his favorite partner and I feel like I can't ditch him now. I have had about 5 or 6 other partners I've met at the gym but each one is very fickle and I am by far the most *experienced* outdoor climber out of all of them, but one of the weakest.  Also I still have some real trust issues with new belayers ever since a guy at the gym misrepresented his belaying skills and decked me from 30' up. 


**Goals:**

Next quarter:

1. Lead Birdland - Red Rock (5.7+) (will be spending a week in Red Rock at the end of the month trad climbing)

2. Swap leads on Snake Dike - Yosemite (5.7R) (week-long trip to Yosemite in April)

3. Lead P-Crack - Bishop Peak (5.9)

4. Lead Royal Arches - Yosemite (5.7, follow 5.10 pitch clean)

5. Drop to 190 lbs



By end of summer:

1. Drop to 180 lbs

2. Saber Ridge Traverse - Sequoia NP (5.7)

2. Fingertrip - Tahquitz (5.7)

3. East Buttress - Mt Whitney (5.7)

4. Follow White Punks on Dope - The Needles (5.9-)


Bucket List:

1. Beckey-Chouinard - The Bugaboos (5.10)

2. The Vampire - Tahquitz (5.11a)

3. The Naked Edge - Eldo (5.11b)

4. Positive Vibrations - The Incredible Hulk (5.11a)

5. Salathe Wall (5.9 C2 *free through mid-5.11*)



**Questions I hope you can help me explore:**


* What does it take to become a 5.11 onsight trad climber without ditching the family and becoming a dirtbag? I feel guilty enough as it is for leaving my wife and daughter for half a day once a week, a full day once a month and a week-long day trip once or twice a year.

* How do I safely push my grades where most of the climbs at my local crag are rated PG-13 or more severe?

* What can I be doing to increase my strength which I believe is directly tied to my self-confidence? I have terrible self-motivation for anything that's not cardio or climbing on real rock. Where can I find pre-built training plans that fit my goals and find people who can help keep me accountable? Should I look for one of those online coaches? I'm not broke so if there's some quality programs out there I'm open to it.

* I have absolutely no motivation to climb hard in the gym. Any suggestions for pushing past that and getting more fit there so I can train harder?

* What's worked for you? What hasn't worked?
Training resistance of aerobic and anaerobic capacity. I’ve finally dedicated some time and energy to understanding the energy systems and how to train them.  and while there is a lot I don’t understand, the direct contradiction I have found from the two major sources on the subject is the training resistance of aerobic capacity vs anaerobic capacity. 

The Eric Horst camp suggests that aerobic capacity is the most training resistant and needs to be worked on for months, even years on end. He also suggest that anaerobic capacity only needs to be worked for two to four weeks to reach its full adaption, being restricted from further adaption due to lack of anerobic-a-lactic and aerobic capacity. 

The Alex narrows PDF suggest almost the exact opposite, laying out adaption times for each: aerobic capacity - 8 weeks, anaerobic capacity - 16+ weeks. Beyond that, he suggest that working aerobic capacity beyond the prescribed length of time is possibly even a wasted effort, as you get no further adaption beyond that. 

Does anyone with a fundamental understanding of the energy systems have any ideas of where this contradiction comes from, and which you believe to be correct? 

And is there another authority on the subject that weighs in on this?
New eLife paper: "Fatigue induces long lasting detrimental changes in motor skill learning" (Branscheidt et al. 2019) **Link:** [https://elifesciences.org/articles/40578](https://elifesciences.org/articles/40578)  


**Abstract:** Fatigue due to physical exertion is a ubiquitous phenomenon in everyday life and especially common in a range of neurological diseases. While the effect of fatigue on limiting skill execution are well known, its influence on learning new skills is unclear. This is of particular interest as it is common practice to train athletes, musicians or perform rehabilitation exercises up to and beyond a point of fatigue. In a series of experiments, we describe how muscle fatigue, defined as degradation of maximum force after exertion, impairs motor skill learning beyond its effects on task execution. The negative effects on learning are evidenced by impaired task acquisition on subsequent practice days even in the absence of fatigue. Further, we found that this effect is in part mediated centrally and can be alleviated by altering motor cortex function. Thus, the common practice of training while, or beyond, fatigue levels should be carefully reconsidered, since this affects overall long-term skill learning.  


**TL;DR for climbers who don't read a boatload of primary research papers:**  


* Pre-fatigue limited skill improvement over time in an isometric pinch-based motor skill task
* Pre-fatigue \*of the opposite hand\* also limited motor skill improvement with the other hand
* The authors used transcranial magnetic stimulation to disrupt motor cortex function after a session of fatigued training, and found that **messing with motor cortex function after training reduced the negative effects of fatigue on motor learning.**
* Fatigue didn't impair non-motor learning
* Fatigue on a non-training day didn't impair motor learning on a training day  


So: if you want to maximize your skill learning, train rested, and stop when you feel fatigued. Not "stop and go burn yourself out in the weight room," but just stop, period. This might explain some of the benefits of split sessions for skill work insofar as it gives you a chance to recover from one half-session's fatigue before trying to do demanding skill work in the other half of your split. Get sleep, manage stressors, don't burn out, try hard. Obviously there's a complicated tradeoff between training volume and quality per unit volume, but \*definitely\* don't pad skill-improvement sessions with fatigue-inducing conditioning - separate sessions for endurance or heavy strength work should do less damage to your finely honed motor patterns than trying to shoehorn them in after a limit bouldering session.
New website about training for climbing (in French) A new website on the subject of training and progression in climbing is online (in French). Nice pictures and well explained.

Edge depth, not the only parameter for hangboard Two popular, yet very different hangboards, are the Beastmaker models and Transgression/Progression boards from Eva Lopez. The Beastmakers are made of wood, the Transgression/Progression are made of polyurethane. The edges on the Beastmaker has a rounded profile and are "slots", where as the Transgression/Progression has sharp edges with little rounding and are not "slots".

However when we talk about hangboarding we almost exclusively talk about edge depth as the only parameter determining the amount of weight one can hang. Sometimes people refer to the rounding of the edge as well, where the consensus seems to be that rounded edges are making the "effective depth" less, and thus harder to hang from compared to a sharper edge of same depth. This sounds logical but is in contradiction to my own experience.

I do a lot of one arm hangs from both boards. Initially I almost exclusively did it on the Beastmaker since it felt more comfortable, it got to the point of where I could hang 112% body-weight on the 23 mm middle edge on the Beastmaker 2000 and 100% body weight on the 15 mm edges on the same board. When I began trying similar hangs on edges of similar depth on the Transgression/Progression boards the amount of weight I could hang from an equal depth sized edge was significantly less. I struggled with 100% body-weight on 20 mm for example.

My feeling was that since the edge was sharper on these boards, the angle of your half crimp position is smaller (more bent fingers) than when the edge is more rounded. I also feel like the skin is not as evenly distributed when the edge is sharper. The edges on the Beastmakers are slots so you also get a slight jamming effect then the side of your finger gets sqeueezed into a corner. It could also be the that the friction coefficients are different for the two materials.

These are my observations and potential causes. I wanted to start a discussion since we often only mention amount of weight hanged as a function of edge depth when it seems like this is not the full model. I am aware about the Lattice hangboard which tries to eliminate all those differences by using this standardized edge, which is a great idea.

When it comes to a training perspective I am inclined to say that the hangs on the Transgression/Progression may yield better results since you have to engage more in your grip and rely less on the friction of the skin. And even tough hangboard numbers are fun and easy to measure compared to actual climbing, how well the hangboard training translates into climbing is probably what is most important (unless you are actually aiming for becoming a hangboard specialist).

&amp;#x200B;

Discussion regarding one armed hangboarding:

* Anyone else has similar experience comparing different hangboards?
* Comparison of half crimp type, large (towards open hand) or small (towards full crimp)
* Rotational position of your body, face against board or face along the board etc. Differences/benefits?
* Angle of your elbow, bent arm vs straight arm? Which translates best to climbing? Personally I feel like when I hang with a straight arm I can focus more on only engaging and squeezing my fingers, even though I am about 10% weaker with a straight arm.
* Considering that we use a full crimp often when we really want the crimp hard on something while climbing, couldn't there be benefits from actually using this when training your fingers sometimes? The consensus seems to be that for campus and hangboarding the full crimp is a big no even though most of us use it while climbing.
* Are there any actual benefits from hanging with one arm compared to two? My feeling is that by isolating one arm at a time it is easier to truly engage in the position. Also of course when you get stronger it gets tedious to deal with a lot of added weight.
Low hanging fruit : the overlooked warmup So recently I've been giving some advice to friends of mine I climb with and realised that I gave the same kind of suggestions quite often : dedicated exercise to do as a warmup. I figured I'd share that here as it could be useful to some, and I'm sure many will have ideas to add to the pile !

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the basic idea : it's important to warmup off the wall (mostly getting the heart rate up a bit, the blood flowing) and on the wall, to prepare the muscles we'll use when trying hard stuff or training. Most people do that, but mostly just climbing easy stuff and increasing the difficulty. It does warm you up but this can also be used to do many different kinds of drills and exercises that'll warm you up just as well, but that will also enable you to improve on a given weakness without having to dedicate specific time to it or sticking to a rigorous schedule where you kinda have to fail on easier stuff than the usual because you need to strain that.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are a few examples : a friend of mine climbs around V4, has only climb indoors and has gotten into the habit of climbing only dynamically and overshoot, when he's climbing on pockets or letterboxes as well call them in french, he lacks precision and reaches too fast, so I suggested to him to do his warmup as a sloth, to do a hover exercises (wait a couple of seconds before catching a hold) so that he learns the basics of positioning for static or more controlled movement on easy terrain.

&amp;#x200B;

Another buddy of mine is now reaching the V6/7 range, but he's crimping almost everything. Holds he can't crimp, he has a lot of trouble climbing on. He's now experiencing finger pain frequently, so I told him he should try and climb everything up to V4 with only a front-3 drag. He should be able to do it most of the time, it might get tricky on some problems, but that'll train it without him having to devote time to it specifically.

&amp;#x200B;

Myself, I tend to climb too dynamically, and not breath, so during my warmup I focus on sloth-like climbing with good breaths on every moves.

&amp;#x200B;

So to wrap things up, hopefully you warm up on the wall, at least a little. Most likely you have a weakness, try and come up with ways to work your weakness the easy way while warming up, so you can get some slow improvements overtime or sometimes even important noob gains, without devoting specific time for that.
CrimpWerks New QC (Quick Change) System is available! Request for feedback &amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/3xumaiy82bl21.jpg

Well after about a year of prototyping and working out the manufacturing kinks, the new CrimpWerks Quick-Change (QC) fingerboards are finally ready!

&amp;#x200B;

These are based off the original concept but with the added capability of being able to “clip on” the holds without the need for tools. You can quickly and easily flip over or change out holds on the fly within a second or two. They weigh 6.5oz with a hold attached and are only a bit larger than a full sized carabiner.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I’m offering 4 different holds with 11 different surfaces:

&amp;#x200B;

* 18mm/10mm/8mm straight edges (Green)
* 14mm/8mm/6mm straight edges (Yellow)
* 15mm rounded sloper and 15 degree flat sloper (Blue)
* 20mm flat sloper at 15 degrees with two 10mm crimps, one slightly pocketed and the other slightly rounded (Red)

&amp;#x200B;

I think this covers a lot of ground, but the intent is to add more hold designs in the future. Given the form factor (the holds generally have to fit in a 90mm x 4mm x 30mm volume) what kinds of hold designs and other surfaces would be useful?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;
No gym, no facilities Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I am in a small village right now for 5 weeks and I have no access to climbing facilities whatsoever, and I look forward to continue training for climbing. I have a hugeass room and something from which I could hang (staircase). What do you recommend for training in the meantime? 

&amp;#x200B;

I had planned on running some 6-10miles and combine this with basic training, such as chin-ups, pull-ups, squats, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Any recommendation? Any resources? Thanks guys!
Resources on Rock Climbing's 2018 batch of research Just a very brief write-up on the 2018 batch of rock climbing research with links to more resources.  Reddit is an incredible, constructively critical community - if you see something that interests you comment on it.  The research community needs to know what directions you want to go in, and we all need help trying to determine the practical potential (or lack thereof) in their work.

Shoulder Stability - utility of RAILs/PAILs Anyone use RAILs / PAILs for pre(re)hab.  It’s supposed to increase end range of motion and stability while increasing strength.  Curious if anyone has used this to improve shoulder strength or to rehab a shoulder injury and what protocol they’ve used with success.
Masters degree in sports science. Climbing related research. Hey guys. Next year i'm going to write my masters degree in sport science. I have my thoughts on doing some research on climbing, but don't know exactly what. Maybe a intervention on bouldering vs lead climbing, with a pre- posttest on a lead route that gets progressive harder. I have been following this subreddit for a year now, and its filled with good discussion surrounding climbing research. I was wondering if you guys have some opinions on what the climbing community needs in term of research?
Hip flexibility is holding me back. Favorite stretches? **Tl;dr:** What are your favorite hip stretches to help with overall hip flexibility, but especially for being able to keep hips/lower body close to the wall? I know frog-stretch and pigeon. 

Here’s some context and rambling for you truly dorky climb-harder folk. 

Mid 20s male, 170cm, I’ve been bouldering for 3ish years, V6/7 indoor &amp; outdoor, but I’m being shut down on both my indoor and outdoor projects because my hips aren’t being sucked into the wall enough. Both are overhung &amp; crimpy.  

Indoor is “Turkey’s revenge v7” on the 2017 moonboard in case anyone else is a moon-person. 

For this project I have a solid high-foot but have to open my hip and turn it towards the wall in order to lock off fully with an arm. I can feel the space between the wall and my hips/pelvis, so I think this is a flexibility issue. I could probably compensate with lockoff and crimp training, but my hips are tight in general so this seems decently important to my progress as a climber. 

Outdoor project is a 2 move wonder V8 that is a jump from 2 awful crimps at a steep overhang with terrrrible feet far out in front/below of you. Hip flexibility doesn’t direct hurt my on this one, but I’m struggling to keep my whole body closer to the rock while jumping for the lip. Any advice, stretches, or exercises would be awesome &amp; so appreciated. I’m guessing the best advice will be to just keep projecting this one, especially since it’s a bit out of my pay-grade. Only a bit though. 



But to the main point, best hip stretches?
Comprehensive core workout for climbers? Hope this doesn't belong in one of the weekly threads. Anyways, I'm looking to train my core effectively, since core is obviously important in climbing. I've been doing this 3x a week on non-climbing days so far:

* 3x10 hanging leg raises. Currently doing these on a captain's chair with a dumbbell between my feet since I can't keep my legs very straight when doing them from a pull-up bar.

* 3x30sec L-sit progression

* 3x10 russian twists w/ medicine ball or dumbbell

The above hits my abs for sure, and my obliques to some extent (the russian twists seem to work my abs more than my obliques). No lower back involved I guess, not sure if that's bad. I'm also wondering if the L-sit progression is a waste of time if I'm already doing hanging leg raises. I just felt like I should be doing some sort of static hold. I was thinking of adding planks, but I can hold front and side plank for more than 2 minutes apiece, so I don't feel like these would do much for me. I may replace russian twists with pallof presses or windshield wipers to  make sure I don't hurt my spine/back.

Is what I'm doing hitting my core hard enough? Are there areas of my core I'm not hitting effectively? Are there exercises I should be adding/removing? Curious what everyone else does.

Major Update for Climbing Coach (Android App) Hi guys! A while back I posted here about my [Android training app](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/ag3ug0/my_training_app_is_finished_climbing_coach_the/). I have completed a huge update with many of the feature requests given on Reddit, as well as a complete overhaul of the UI. 

&amp;#x200B;

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adamson.miles.climbingtrainer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adamson.miles.climbingtrainer)

&amp;#x200B;

Changelist:

&amp;#x200B;

\-All menu icons and exercises now have a photo as their button. 

\-All screens now scroll vertically, with much more white space than before. 

\-All screens now have a white background, instead of colored polygon backdrops

\-European grades added to the settings cog in the main menu (top right corner)

\-Program details now displayed under the program in "Load Program" as a reminder as to how the program was set when it was created (grade, date, type)

\-Exercises are now split up into types in the main menu. Exercises are then split up again by equipment needed

\-Exercise information is now in a table format, with its description and rest at the bottom. The entire screen scrolls now, opposed to just the small box where the description used to be

\-"Build Program" is now a single screen, opposed to a series of menus. This fixed many crashes where selections were not saved properly when attempting to build a program

\-Fixed many exercise typos and content issues where the drill took longer than it stated it should. There are likely still more typos, dm/email me if so

\-Fixed an issue where changes to the exercise database were only made upon an uninstall/reinstall. Changes to the exercise database will now go through with just an update, meaning program data and custom exercises are preserved

\-Changed date format from numbers only to "long" format, where the month is the full word. This will not be updated for old programs, only new ones as of this update

&amp;#x200B;

Debating on amputating a reattached finger - want opinions Hey guys, about a year and a half ago I partially amputated 2 of my fingers, middle and Pinky fingers on my left hand. Luckily the doctor was able to reattach them, the middle phalanx of my middle finger was shattered and shorted in order to be reattached.  During the healing/casting period, a lot of my finger and forearm muscles in my left arm atrophied and had to go through weeks of rehab before I was able to even pick up a cup again.

Since the accident I've gone back to climbing a few times and the grip and fingers on my left are still noticeably weaker and affects the way I climb. I'm not able to trust putting a lot of weight or pulling hard with my left so I'll over compensate by using my right a lot more.

Recently I was watching The Dawn Wall on Netflix and it talked about how Tommy Caldwell had amputated his finger and is still able to climb at a high level. This got me thinking that if I could amputate the reattached part of my finger, it might help me with not only climbing again but other sports I dabble in (BJJ &amp; boxing) since I won't have the fear of re-breaking the finger hanging over me. Does this make any sense or am I crazy to think so?

Hoping someone else here has gone through a similar experience, climbing with reattached finger/amputated fingers, and can share their views. Thanks!

Quick and Dirty Tricks I thought I’d make a list of the easiest non- training ways to get better at climbing. 

NOTE: A lot of these tips can make climbing less fun and/or much more injury prone. Have fun, be courteous, and don’t be a dumbass.

- Antihydral: Far and away the most effective tool in a climber’s skin care arsenal. If you have ever had problems with sweat, thin tips, or pain while climbing, it’s worth experimenting with this stuff. Personally it added a grade to my climbing almost overnight.

- Floodlights: Climbing at night is colder. Cold rock = more sends. This extends almost every climbing season by about a month.

- Caffiene: If you have psyche problems this is your ticket to being energized (duh).

- Pain Killers: BE CAREFUL with this one. Popping a couple ibuprofen makes you much more susceptible to injury. However it can also give you  that extra 5% try hard you need to send the proj. Personally I use this sparingly.  

- Tick Marks: Putting racing stripes on every hold isn’t the classiest thing to do, but eliminating those extra milliseconds you take to target a hold helps. Brush them when you’re done.

- Brushing holds: Every hold gets brushed every attempt. Friction isn’t only important on the crux. 

- Stack Pads/ Playing with starting positions: If you’re having trouble pulling your ass off the ground, try shoving a few pads underneath or changing how you’re leaning when you pull on. If you’re European you might consider this cheating. 

- Portable Fan: I don’t rely on the weather gods for my sending breeze.

- Rubbing Alcohol: ONLY FOR USE ON NON-FRAGILE GRANITE SLOPERS!!! Alcohol cleans grease and chalk off of holds while cooling them. It also makes certain rock types much more likely to break. Don’t be the selfish prick who breaks a climb because you were too lazy to wait for good conditions. It also works on your hands.

- Wait for good conditions: And figure out what those are for your project

- Portable Heater: At close to freezing and below, shoe rubber becomes less effective: heating your shoes can help you stick.

- Eat carbs: 30-60 min before you climb

- Videotape Attempts: Watching how your own body moves when you stick a hold or fall is massively better than hearing about it second hand.

- Download Beta Videos: I often screen record videos of problems I’m interested in. Saves skin and time, but takes some of the fun out of it.

- Wear Stretchy Clothes: Cuz duh

- Play Music: Helps me get aggressive. Only do this if you’re SURE that nobody else can hear it and you’re not disturbing a peaceful environment.

- Carry different shoes and kneepads: Sometimes this is what does the trick. Less often than people think though.



Comment your tips and tricks if you have good ones to add.
Training advice for an ageing returnee I have tried to find good information about training programs for returning climbers in their 40ies. Google gives some rudimentary answers, mostly the same advice any 40-55-year-old of any sport would get about how the body changes and what to expect. That’s all fine, I consider myself quite ok for my age, but I’m not delusional either. My next birthday I will be closer to 50 than 40 and that is a fact. 

I started climbing 1990 and climbed on and off for several years. Around 2000 I stepped up and climbed a lot. I climbed routes at 8a (5.13b) and sometimes bouldered at about the same level depending on where my focus was at. I managed to stay injury free.

In mid 2000 I started a company, worked my ass off, got children. Climbing vanished. But I always stayed active, bike to work, ran, and sometimes hit the gym, Ashtanga yoga in periods as well. 

Now my daughters are older, 8 and 12, and we went to a local climbing gym just before christmas. And they loved it. We have been going ever since, once a week. I use the self-belay systems at the gym, and off the bat climbed harder routes. Technique is all intact, feels like a haven’t been away from the wall at all. But strength is seriously lacking.  

Now for my question. I have got a membership at an ordinary gym through work. I want to redevelop my strength for climbing. I do like to work out hard, but I rather train shorter passes on my lunch break than to commit to long sessions in the evening. I know that climbing is the best training for climbing, but I can’t commit to climbing at the climbing gym too often. But I can squeeze a session at the gym across the street before or after work, or at the lunch break.

Any books, sites, spreadsheets, links, theories or questions you have, please send my way. I would be forever thankful. I’ve been trying very hard not too write a wall of text, but I’ve failed. I love climbing, and for the 10+ years I didn’t climb very much, that didn’t change. I love to climb with my children, it’s a perfect way to hang out and do something together. But it is hard to not think of old times when power was limitless. 😊

Discrepancy in crimp strength open hand vs. half crimp Hey all,

After been mostly an indoor climber for 6/7 years, I’ve slowly been transitioning to outdoor bouldering. I noticed that most of the holds on hard boulders outside are sharp, small, incut crimps which I do very poorly on due to the holds forcing a half/full crimp. It’s obvious whenever I try a boulder I get held back only by my finger strength. 


For perspective, I can one arm the beast maker small crimp and hold the middle crimp for 30 seconds with open hand only. With a half crimp, I can’t even start to hang. I’ve climbed v11 (slopers) but the hardest crimp line I’ve done is only v8. 

Is there anyone else with this issue and how did you solve this?
Please help me learn how to git good at heel hooks Okay so quick background for context. 
  
I have been stuck in V5 range for a hot minute. I have strong pull strength in my arms, but I lack ability to use my feet to help keep me on bad holds. I can throw my heel up, but I can't understand how to use a high heel to help me stay on the wall and move vertical.
  
Is there exercises to help improve heel hook strength and stability?
Any stretches to help?
Any technical tricks that I may be overlooking?
  
All help is appreciated. Thank you all.
Diagnosing bad movement pattern VS. Lack of strength on a particular movement type. So I've run into this a number of times on different climbs, and would like to not chuff off finish jugs anymore. Basically, I'll stick my hand onto a big jug with one hand (the other often being pretty bad), and then instead of just swinging straight in the direction I was going when I stuck it, my entire body will start rotating, and I'll be peeled off the jug, often with the chest opening away from the wall, less often twisting under. 

My basic question is, is this just a case of bad shoulder stability/strength, or is it bad movement patterns, or some combination?

A couple examples: 

[this move is super apparent](https://youtu.be/1F73BfCWVLE?t=132), and in the top 5 biggest chuffs ever, I found the perfect balance next attempt, and landed perfectly.

[This move is similar, but I'm able to hang on](https://youtu.be/Jm0zjaBBi-g?t=13) and stop the rotation, but it almost happened again.

[Another example](https://youtu.be/orpK8jelmsY), but slightly different setup. If I didn't rotate, or was strong enough, I probably could have saved this attempt (besides the botched setup beta).

I don't have video of this one, but this boulder was the climb that made me realized that it was also a movement pattern thing [This climb one](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfXF6gpBGRe/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet). I had to intentionally flick with my leading hand to create torque in the opposite direction, so I could land the position and squeeze the trash slopers.

So my questions are: 1) Why does this happen? 2) Would getting stronger shoulders or chest make it easier to control when this starts to happen? 3) should I just use this to learn how to not let this happen?

I have trained up shoulder girdle stability a bit, and can hang one armed on a bar fairly comfortably while resisting all rotation, and can also perform a one arm pull up on occasion. I've diagnosed myself with fairly weak shoulders/rotator cuff (possibly very weak), and am trying to figure out how to address that weakness and the movement pattern biases I've developed around it.
Climbing trip and food Hi guys! Going away on a two month trip to Spain and we're going to be living in a van. I'm currently racking my brain for recipes, snacks, etc that are suitable for van living and climbing. There will be a fridge but fridge-free snacks and foods are a plus! Dirtbag friendly (i.e cheap) is also a major bonus!

What are you're favorite cragsnacks  and van-meals? Any cooking hacks and tricks? Do you use a lot of supplements? All 
tips and tricks are welcome!

Edit: typo
Lattice Lite Plan - Assessment Results Thought I'd share my results from the assessment I did for my Lattice Lite plan, in case it's of interest to anyone here. Feel free to ask questions! I'm just starting the 3-month training program now, so time will tell whether this was a good use of time &amp; money.

**Background:** I've been climbing for a long time, but over the past few years have gotten less and less time on real rock due to life circumstances. The last year in particular has been rock-less as the priority has been taking care of our first kid. I get to the climbing gym usually one day per weekend, and try to do two supplemental strength sessions during the week. I've got an extended European vacation coming up in September/October, which will start with a few weeks of non-climbing family time in Italy and then culminate in a couple weeks of sport climbing in Spain. So, I'm looking to be as efficient and effective with my limited training time over the next \~6 months so that I can climb well in Spain. I don't have any goal routes or projects, and will probably prioritize breadth/onsighting over depth/redpointing since it will be my first time there.

**Assessment &amp; Results:** there have been some other posts here that outline the Lattice lite assessment, so I won't go over that in detail. Basically, they have you do a few tests on a hangboard (finger strength, power endurance), max 2-rep pull ups, and hip flexibility. I used the big flat edge on Tension Flashboard for the finger strength &amp; PE, so not directly comparable to the Lattice standard edge, for whatever that's worth. My results across these dimensions, in order of weakness to strength:

* Hip flexibility: Apparently my hip flexibility was extremely poor relative to Lattice's dataset, so this is the highest priority for me to improve
* Finger strength: 134% BW, which is apparently in line with my bouldering grade and slightly low for my sport grade. This is a moderate priority for my training
* Pull ups: 140% BW, which is apparently just shy of their 'gold standard' of 150%. Not a top priority, but will still do weighted pull ups 1x per week
* Power endurance: I was able to do 183 seconds of 7:3 repeaters (i.e. 18 reps + 3 secs into the 19th) using 60% of my max finger strength load (i.e. 60% x 134% = 80% BW). Apparently this is above average and not a top priority, but will still be targeted in my training plan since I'm hoping to climb a lot of long enduro routes in Spain

Overall while I'm not too surprised by the strength results, I hadn't thought of myself as deficient in hip flexibility prior to this, so it's great to know that this is a weakness I can prioritize more than I would have had I not undergone the assessment. Something that wasn't tested in the assessment was the anaerobic capacity, but based on my first workout doing 7:3 repeaters at 80% max (which happens to be just about BW for me), I suspect this is also a weakness, as I couldn't even complete the full # of sets prescribed in the Crimpd app. 

Even without knowing what kind of improvement I'll see on this program, I already feel fairly confident in recommending it to anyone that wants to have a structured plan to follow but doesn't want to invest the time/energy into building it themselves.
Coming back to climbing after hiatus, just wondering how to know if my tendons are keeping up? Recently came back to climbing after a 6 month hiatus because of health reasons. Have been climbing in the gym and progressing. Before I took my break I was working on v7/8s. And ive been back to the gym 7 times now and have sent a few v5s. I feel really at home on crimps but i'm just wondering if it's possible to overdo it and injure myself? I don't know if i'm moving too quickly for my tendons to strengthen back properly, or even how that works. Thanks.
I'm moving and becoming the next door neighbor of a huge climbing gym this weekend. What would you do? Already I'm climbing indoors twice a week and outdoors once a week (ice in the winter). I'm thinking maybe climbing almost every day, but in between my usual big sessions (one bouldering, one lead) maybe do some shorter sessions before my usual bodyweight strength route and hangboarding. In the summer I go bouldering or climbing outdoors whenever there's a good weather day and I have the time (so more or less I do all my climbing outdoors then)

What would you do in this situation? The gym has autobelay walls, bouldering and lead walls, a Moonboard, a system wall, and barbell+weights+ the usual climbing and campus stuff. It's Magnus Midtbø's gym if that rings any bells.
How far can you progress your sport climbing without any non-climbing exercises? I am currently sport climbing ~6b+ with 3 sessions a week of roughly 3 hours each. To progress further (faster) would I benefit from fx hangboarding/moonboarding or other off the wall 'exercises'? If so which exercises should I look into?
Does the pinky matter? Most efficient and powerful way to grab holds? I feel like I have a slightly shorter than average pinky and I tend to not use it on certain holds. It just kind of floats under or is curled towards my palm. I have a climbing buddy who is insanely strong and says that I’m missing strength by not using my pinky finger. Is there any truth to that? He also says its best to grab holds with no space between my fingers, as if they were all super glued together because that’s how they are strongest together. I’ve tried both his recommendations but they feel awkward and unnatural. Is he messing with me?

Edit: The pinky is powerful! Pinky it is my dudes. Thanks for the discussion, I’ll probably climb like 2 or 3 grades harder now with all this extra pulling power. Thanks everyone 👍
Why do I find steep routes so hard? Although there are of course many ways for a route to achieve a certain grade, I've noticed a tendency that (at least on Southern European limestone) the shift from the low 7s to the upper 7s very often comes in the form of the 'overall' steepness of a route.  In the high 6s/low 7s there are bulges to overcome on holds of varying quality, but to climb the classic lines on Kalymnos for example, which start at 7b or so, the routes are consistently overhanging.

At the moment I'm climbing 7a quite happily.  My fingers are quite strong making harder face climbs feel okay, and I've been training on the Moon Board which makes short steep sections at these grades on poor holds feel fine. But when things get consistently steep I flail hard. A list of symptoms include...

I'm not able to rest that effectively even on jugs.
I feel like my feet aren’t bearing much of my weight.  That obviously makes bad hands feel terrible.  It also makes clipping difficult and insecure.
My mental strength evaporates and I lose the will to fight much quicker than I would on something like a crimpy crux where my mental game I think is pretty good.

I am tall (6 foot 2) and heavy (85kg).  I posted a video a year ago or so of me climbing in this sub for you to get an idea of my technique - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ymdfn3hzRY&amp;feature=youtu.be .  I would say I am now considerably stronger than I was in that video.

So any advice?  Climbing fast and training power endurance are obvious candidates for thing to do, but I feel like there is something more fundamental I’m missing that make me so relatively bad at this type of climbing.  What should I be training to break through to the next level?
Skin farming Any tips to help skin grow back faster?! Maybe Im looking for a unicorn here. Im not talking flappers, gouges, cuts, etc. but just evenly worn-down, thin, medium-rare tips. I have found that using a band aid overnight and generous moisturizing does speed up skin repair, but it also makes the skin soft. My patience is running out...

&amp;#x200B;

I do know about the rhino skin products, thats what Im currently using. (Also, I see theres another post today on a similar subject... Im really looking for skin farming tips tho)
Spacing Between Fingers When Crimping Referencing this post https://redd.it/b49wc2 - there didn't seem to be a lot of answers regarding OPs second question. This is something I've honestly never thought about and am curious if someone with more knowledge could chime in. To paraphrase, the question was: should I grab holds without any spacing between my fingers, as if my fingers were superglued together, for optimal strength? 

Edit: The title says "Crimping", but I want to extend the discussion to open hand as well.
What Is Your Trip Strategy? After lots of experimentation I might be inching closer to such logical things as rest periods between burns, number of project burns per day, etc., but still find myself making some big mistakes and ending up in a mid-trip hole.  Rather than just asking everyone what I am doing wrong, maybe it's useful to make a thread of pointers and personal strategies that others can pick and learn from.


I think it's useful for reference to discuss how we might manage some of the bigger picture aspects of trips.  Can be in a format like:

* Type of Climbing:
* Rock type:
* Sleeping/accommodations:
* Trip goals (project, classic mileage, explore, etc):
* Strategies (nutrition, skin, sleep, non-climbing activities):

Personally I am observing others do tons more climbing throughout the day, split AM/PM sessions, and maintaining or gaining strength through a trip and feel like I'm wasting valuable time and fun not having some basic frameworks to follow.
How do you guys safely warm up for hard climbs at the crag? In the gym there’s plenty of easy access to juggy V0,1,2,etc. to warm up on. Sometimes at the boulders there’s really nothing “easy” to warm up on and I just get right to the hard climbs. I’m particularly worried about an old pulley injury that’s finally healed so I can climb again but I don’t know how to warm up safely outside. What do you guys do to get the blood flowing and tendons primed?
Which muscles are employed when you climb and which ones should you strengthen for antagonist exercises? I’ve been researching how to stabilize the shoulder for a while but I’m still confused about what typically happens with the rotator cuff in climbers. 

For sure the lats get worked while climbing. Supposedly the teres major and other external rotators are employed too...And yet I have PTs suggesting that I do external rotator exercises to counteract the rounding of the shoulders and fix impingement. 

I’ve also heard that the pec muscles shorten, and that I should stretch them. But in addition, I’ve heard that you should do push-ups to counteract all the pulling that you do while climbing. Wouldn’t doing push ups further shorten the pec muscles?  

So what are we to do? Push exercises to oppose all the pulling? External rotators? 

Can anybody set me straight here? Or do I have to continue my fruitless search for a PT that also climbs haha
Worried about my finger joints I've been climbing for about two and half years. Currently 29 turning 30 next month.

I Just completed two relatively intense 4-week cycles of training. the first was strength focused with lots of max hangs and bouldering, the second (and most recent) was endurance related with high volume linked boulders sets, repeaters and ARCing. I saw significant gains in both cycles.

the problem is my fingers are really starting to concern me. I've always been the type to have stiffness in my fingers in the morning after particular intense indoor sessions, but its gotten worse after completing my endurance cycle. when I wake up my fingers are very stiff. Extra effort is required to get them to go from an open hand position to a closed fist and there is pain in the joint when doing that. The motion is also not smooth the fingers seem to snap into place rather than continuously moving through the motion. After about 10 minutes my fingers are completely normal again and function fine and pain-free.

I haven't climbed in three days and the condition is still there in the morning. I'm starting to get worried that climbing may be causing me Osteoarthritis.

Anyone have any experience with this?

I guess i'm just looking for hope that this is something I can overcome while still getting better at climbing. I love climbing and climbing hard and can't imagine having to give it up, but I certainly wouldn't want to have this condition get worse or linger all day rather than just 10 minutes in the morning.

Currently I just stretch forearms and that's about it. considering doing rice bucket work for antagonist muscles of the forearms. Anyone have success with these?
Eric Horst &amp; The Science of Healthy Tendons Well Mr. Horst dropped a new podcast today, [seen here.](https://player.fm/series/eric-hrsts-training-for-climbing-podcast/episode-33-training-for-stronger-tendons-and-ligaments) If anyone has listened to it I'd love to hear what you thought. I'm interested in the results, and if there is cost effective supplementation you know of.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DL

You can feed muscle after exercise due to the way they get bloodflow. This doesn't work for tendons. You have to preload the nutrients before exercise to get them into the tendon and ligament. According to a study he cites, the way to do this effectively is with **vitamin C enriched hydrolyzed collagen**. He now sells a [line of supplements](https://physivantage.com/products/supercharged-collagen) to fill this niche.

&amp;#x200B;

My question to any of you: Can you find or do you know of any supplements or stacks with close to the same amino acid profiles as the supplements he sells? It is definitely a much broader profile than any BCAA's I've taken. The vitamin c enriched aspect is simple to supplement, just take the amino acids with anything containing ascorbic acid.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: [Something close to the same nutritional info, just add orange juice.](https://www.amazon.ca/Premium-Collagen-Peptides-Certified-Friendly/dp/B00XQ2XGAA/ref=sr_1_5?crid=WTHEO521QMBA&amp;keywords=hydrolyzed+collagen+powder&amp;qid=1554132239&amp;refinements=p_85%3A5690392011&amp;rnid=5690384011&amp;rps=1&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=hydroly%2Caps%2C159&amp;sr=8-5)
Half vs. Full Crimp confusion :( Hey everyone, 

I have searched this subreddit and mountainproject and cannot seem to find a definitive answer. Climbers seem to fall into 2 camps with regard to definitions of half vs full crimp. I am going to speak in anatomical terms to avoid confusion. 

Camp 1: 

-Half crimp = hyperextension of DIP (B in picture linked below)

-Full crimp = half crimp as described above + thumb lock over index finger (C in picture linked below)

http://theclimbingdoctor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-06-at-3.55.58-PM1.png

Camp 2: 

-Half crimp = DIP at 180 degrees without hyperextension (B in picture linked below)

-Full crimp = DIP hyperextended regardless of thumb placement (C in picture linked below, though in this case thumb lock is utilized. Theoretically, B from the picture linked ABOVE would also be considered a full crimp)

https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laurent_Vigouroux/publication/221837117/figure/fig1/AS:305600819941376@1449872321395/Illustration-of-the-slope-a-half-crimp-b-and-full-crimp-c-grip-techniques-used.png

A perfect example of the half-crimp as defined by camp 2 would be this: 
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uNz4Vhb7bRQ/TleBhyDr8iI/AAAAAAAAAJU/X90dB9P1R_4/s1600/half-crimp.jpg

This distinction is hugely important because everyone says to avoid full crimping to prevent undue stress on the finger pullies. I have been holding onto all crimp holds using half crimp according to the first definition (DIP hyperextension without the thumb) but full crimp according to the second (DIP &gt;180 degrees regardless of thumb). Furthermore, this article suggests that the thumb lock should be utilized for all crimps as it increases  strength by 17% without increasing finger pulley strain (https://theclimbingdoctor.com/rock-climbing-pulley-injury/) which flies in the face of a lot of the common knowledge I see on these forums and discussions. 

When I train the half crimp on the hangboard, my fingers automatically go into hyperextension when I try hard, and I never use the thumb lock. Should I start over with all my climbing and hangboarding and try to maintain that 180 degree angle at my DIP when I am half-crimping? I would gladly do it if it would result in less risk of injury. 

Another issue is that I can only accomplish the half crimp according to camp 2 with my first three fingers (I.e. 180 degrees at DIP without hyper flexion) if my pinky is essentially in open hand position (half a pad on, flexion at DIP, straight DIP). If I want my pinky to be in half crimp position (DIP at 180 degrees), it forces my longer index/middle/ring fingers to go into hyperextension. 

So what is the right answer here?? Thanks in advance! 

NOTE: I have read the wiki and it unfortunately does not address my main issue regarding DIP hyperextension. It simply says: 

A : Open crimp (open index and crimp middle finger)

B : Half crimp (fingers bent at 90° angle)

C : (Full) Crimp (thumb locking the grip)

If a full crimp is simply defined by thumb lock, is DIP hyperextension ever allowed? I am so confused.
I made another video! This time I wanted to show every single attempt that it took to send in an effort to show what the process of working hard climbs can look like. More to come soon
My notes from Youtube's take on skincare So I've been training hard lately and my skin is becoming a limiting factor, I have sessions planned, outdoor days coming up and I know if I do both I won't have enough skin to climb hard so I'm taking forced rest days because of skin... So I decided I'd look into skin care, having never really researched the subject beyond the basics, but unfortunately this sub has plenty of "basics" info but nothing detailed and specific, so I figured I'd look on Youtube and share my findings ! Please share your own bits of wisdom too so we can have our little bible of climbing skin care !

Wash your hands. After you're climbing you've got chalk on your hands, make sure you wash your hands thoroughly to get all that chalk off. I even use a little brush to get in the cracks that get really dry - Dan Turner [https://youtu.be/2-\_\_3oWmGJQ?t=28](https://youtu.be/2-__3oWmGJQ?t=28)

I generally don't moisturise my skin.\[...\] I would only moisturise if I'm in a dry place like Bishop. \[...\] I use something like a Nutrogena standard hand cream and also remember to keep hydrated.- DT [https://youtu.be/2-\_\_3oWmGJQ?t=152](https://youtu.be/2-__3oWmGJQ?t=152)

Avoid water - Eric Karlsson Bouldering [https://youtu.be/fyDFqEzXrM0?t=552](https://youtu.be/fyDFqEzXrM0?t=552)

&amp;#x200B;

**Skincare products**

I use Antihydral and this electric file - Magnus Mitbo [https://youtu.be/WoftTE0RPl0?t=21](https://youtu.be/WoftTE0RPl0?t=21)

\[Using Antihydral\] I just put a little dot on each finger and spread it out to both hands and I try to avoid the cracks and only cover the tip of each finger.\[...\] I apply it once a month max and go to sleep like that -  MM [https://youtu.be/WoftTE0RPl0?t=91](https://youtu.be/WoftTE0RPl0?t=91)

\[Regarding Splits\] Elizabeth Arden 8-hour Cream will change your life. \[...\] Repairs your skin really quickly - DT [https://youtu.be/2-\_\_3oWmGJQ?t=69](https://youtu.be/2-__3oWmGJQ?t=69)

If you have sweaty skin Antihydral is the one for you.\[...\] If you've never used Antihydral I would maybe start with one of the Rhino Skin products \[which are less aggressive\] - DT [https://youtu.be/2-\_\_3oWmGJQ?t=106](https://youtu.be/2-__3oWmGJQ?t=106)

Antihydral, The cream that you put on your fingers to kill the skin and make it grow thicker. - EKB [https://youtu.be/fyDFqEzXrM0?t=112](https://youtu.be/fyDFqEzXrM0?t=112)

Antibydral makes your skin super dry so it makes your skin last longer so it's worth it but your have to build your life around Antihydral - EKB [https://youtu.be/fyDFqEzXrM0?t=334](https://youtu.be/fyDFqEzXrM0?t=334)

&amp;#x200B;

**Filing**

\[Using an electric file\] I try to get the cracks and round the finger. I avoid the middle part of the finger because that's already worn out - MM [https://youtu.be/WoftTE0RPl0?t=63](https://youtu.be/WoftTE0RPl0?t=63)

Just try and get your skin as smooth as possible - DT [https://youtu.be/2-\_\_3oWmGJQ?t=44](https://youtu.be/2-__3oWmGJQ?t=44)

You can use a scalpel to remove skin to avoid splits - EKB [https://youtu.be/fyDFqEzXrM0?t=275](https://youtu.be/fyDFqEzXrM0?t=275)

Make your skin smooth and flat so you don't see the split anymore - EKB [https://youtu.be/fyDFqEzXrM0?t=294](https://youtu.be/fyDFqEzXrM0?t=294)

Also file the top of your finger. When you climb on crimp if you have too much skin you often roll off crimps - EKB [https://youtu.be/fyDFqEzXrM0?t=310](https://youtu.be/fyDFqEzXrM0?t=310)

A razor blade is always useful if you have cuts or edges in your skin so you can cut and make them smooth again - Alex Megos [https://youtu.be/VNR-QtELyPc?t=34](https://youtu.be/VNR-QtELyPc?t=34) shared by [gastongastoff](https://www.reddit.com/user/gastongastoff)

&amp;#x200B;

**Treating skin injuries**

\[Regarding really worn out tips\] I would just sandpaper the sides and maybe the cracks and wouldn't use any climbing balms - MM [https://youtu.be/WoftTE0RPl0?t=155](https://youtu.be/WoftTE0RPl0?t=155)

\[Regarding flappers\] I just cut away the dead skin \[...\] and use some Climb On or something to make them heal because they tend to really dry and crack up. If you tape it you can easily keep climbing or training - MM [https://youtu.be/WoftTE0RPl0?t=170](https://youtu.be/WoftTE0RPl0?t=170)

\[Regarding flaky skin\] I prefer to sand all of the flakes off to make it even. \[...\] I also apply Climb On because flaky skin tends to get really dry - MM [https://youtu.be/WoftTE0RPl0?t=195](https://youtu.be/WoftTE0RPl0?t=195)

\[Regarding split\] Sand paper the whole thing so there's less skin around the crack. Use some Climb On, especially if having a rest day when you have some time for it to wash off because I hate climbing with \*Climb On skin\* or having Climb On on my hands - MM [https://youtu.be/WoftTE0RPl0?t=216](https://youtu.be/WoftTE0RPl0?t=216)

\[Climbing with tape on worn our finger\] Start putting some super glue on your worn our finger tip or if you have a split, but not into the cut, on the sides. \[...\] Let it dry for a few seconds but not totally dry before you apply the tape. Then start applying the tape from the bottom, roll it up. - EKB [https://youtu.be/fyDFqEzXrM0?t=453](https://youtu.be/fyDFqEzXrM0?t=453)

Climbskin isn't greasy whatsoever, dries quickly and repairs my hands almost magically. - [Eternlgladiator](https://www.reddit.com/user/Eternlgladiator) [https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/4waiei/skin\_talk/d65dcn1?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/4waiei/skin_talk/d65dcn1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

The difference between Climb On and nothing is largely olfactory. I have, however, seen negative results from using the wrong product. I lost a half season to some Badger Balm a few years back.

\[Regarding Rhino Skin\] They have 2 products with the same active ingredient as antihydral (methanamine), but in lower concentration: the Dry spray, and Performance lotion. Much less of a pain in the ass since you can apply it to your whole hand without worrying about splitting at the cracks and you can have more options for frequency. - [n00blebowl](https://www.reddit.com/user/n00blebowl) [https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/4waiei/skin\_talk/d662vub?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/4waiei/skin_talk/d662vub?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

\[Climbing indoors with glassy tips\] Wash your hands with soap and warm water for about a minute. Then dry your hands with an air dryer. As the skin is drying use your fingernails to scrape your fingertips, this will create tiny little abrasions and make your fingertips a bit rougher - [straightCrimpin](https://www.reddit.com/user/straightCrimpin) in this thread below with more details

If you get that issue where the skin peels away from the nail slightly, then putting a tiny bit of superglue between the nail and the skin can help (helps hold it together a bit and stops chalk getting in there). - [LimitedConsequence](https://www.reddit.com/user/LimitedConsequence) in this thread

Morphology &amp; Style Differences — Beta Analysis Today's beta analysis will be on a problem called *One Last Dance*, which is a V4 face climb characterized by large reaches on decent feet and a pair of small crimps in the middle. Disclaimer: myself (gray sweater) and my buddy I'll call Q (green sweater) are climbing well above the V4 level, so we can get away with imperfections and still complete the route.

With that said, here are the two videos in question:

1. [Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggC3jv11W6I)
2. [Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twlr2jK6oyI)

I highly recommend watching both videos to provide further context for each screenshot. Climbing pace and flow are important factors which screenshots can't capture well!

Analysis will be done at key points in the climb with accompanying screenshots. Morphology and style differences will be the main discussion topics. For reference, I'm 5'11" (180cm) with a +12cm wingspan, whereas Q is 6'2" (187cm) with a slightly negative wingspan.

#Position 1

1. [Me](https://prnt.sc/n7xstd)
2. [Q](https://prnt.sc/n7xsyw)

The starting position consists of the only available holds. The snapshot is right before we generate an upwards motion to move to the thin crimp up and to the left.

My approach was to sag my hips low down to weight the feet, treating the move as a deadpoint. I know that I have to get more extended than Q to reach the crimp, so I want to buy myself some time to make it to the crimp without needing to crank on the right hand.

Q's approach was to move to the crimp in a more static lockoff. This has the advantage of accuracy and is easier on the fingers when hitting the hold, but also allows him to maintain consistent pressure through his right foot, which he plans on keeping on for longer than I will.

#Position 2

1. [Me](https://prnt.sc/n7x9qs)
2. [Q](https://prnt.sc/n7xa17)

By now, most of my weight has been transferred onto my left foot, as seen by the ankle height relative to the toes. In Q's photo, his ankle is almost horizontal with his toes, suggesting a greater reliance on the right foot. These findings are further supported by the differences in upper body positioning, where I'm almost vertical and Q is tilted over to the right side.

Height plays a factor in determining how much weight should be on each foot. Q is taller, and is therefore going to be able to keep his hips further to the right while still pulling into the crimp. This shows itself through Q's lesser degree of shoulder flexion than myself and through his hips having to come out from the face, whereas I'm extended enough that my hips have to posteriorly tilt and thus being closer to the face.

#Position 3

1. [Me](https://prnt.sc/n7xc7s)
2. [Q](https://prnt.sc/n7xcd1)

Alright, our first substantial difference!

I decide to shift my weight entirely onto my left foot, which requires my hips to shift left. This takes my weight underneath my left hand and allows me to reach my right hand to the open crimp without needing a right foot while still being in balance.

Q, on the other hand, keep tension through his right foot as he reaches up his right hand to the open crimp. This extends his body, which then requires him to shift his weight to the left in order to make further progress. This would be the required method if the left hand were a trash sloper, but since it's a crimp, both mine and his options work. His relies more on the right open hand instead of the left crimp, whereas mine was the opposite.

#Position 4

1. [Me](https://prnt.sc/n7xdjf)
2. [Q](https://prnt.sc/n7xdv1)

Again, style differences are immediately apparent.

My left foot is front stepped to make it easier for me to dynamically push my hips up and to the right above my right foot, which is great for a dynamic move such as a deadpoint. Q is set up underneath the hands and close to the face with a slight amount of left internal hip rotation, implying that he wants to move almost directly vertical instead of to the side and up. His right leg is loaded and toe pointing almost directly towards the face, which strengthens the case for a vertical move. My position is better set up to weight the left crimp, whereas Q's position is better set up to weight the right open crimp. 

#Position 5

1. [Me](https://prnt.sc/n7xlew)
2. [Q](https://prnt.sc/n7xlk6)

We both realize that the position calls for a lockoff instead of a dynamic pull, but we approach the lockoff differently. I still retain the dynamic approach where, in the event that the next rail is further away than I think, I can still move dynamically instead of being stuck partway through. Q sinks far onto his right front step and heavily loads it, which is great for wanting to maximize reach while staying in close to the face. He is able to move with either hand to the rail because of his shifted hips and lesser degree of external right hip rotation than myself. He pulls in so close to the hands because he wants to keep a lockoff, trusting in his knowledge of his own dimensions along with strength, whereas I trust them less.

#Position 6

1. [Me](https://prnt.sc/n7x81j)
2. [Q](https://prnt.sc/n7x8cb)

Interestingly, our lower bodies retain a similar difference in external rotation, for both legs. Q's hips are a bit lower and are less extended due to height differences, but this has also forced him to keep his left upper body closer to his left hand, which weights it more than I have to weight mine. My right arm is slightly more extended than his, likely due to difference in lat extension. Q is extended a lot more through his right lat and has a greater degree of shoulder flexion as a result to reach the hold, whereas I'm using my wingspan to my advantage by leaning my upper body a bit further to the left, which negates any height disadvantage present during a vertical reach.

#Position 7

1. [Me](https://prnt.sc/n7xf8x)
2. [Q](https://prnt.sc/n7xfg2)

I go for a carbon copy of the previous move, but with the advantage of being on a jug rail. A backstep is out of the question because the foot is facing the wrong way, so the only option is to perform some sort of front step.

Q showcases the left front step, in an easier position than the one I chose because his opposing hand is able to move further to the side than mine can. My position, however, would be the easier of the two if the rail were not usable so far to the side. Regardless, because the rail is a jug, both of us can easily get away with either in this case. If the rail were a sloper but still extend further to the right, then Q's way would be far easier.

#Position 8

1. [Me](https://prnt.sc/n7xgqm)
2. [Q](https://prnt.sc/n7xgx3)

I'm treating the lip holds as though they're good (which they are), whereas Q is treating them like a sloper. It's important to note that he ended up using a wet hold just before the lip which made the lip feel a lot like a sloper rather than a jug, which could explain why he is staying to the right and leaning his entire upper body in that direction.

#Position 9

1. [Me](https://prnt.sc/n7xhvj)
2. [Q](https://prnt.sc/n7xi2f)

The key point here is the difference in right foot positioning. My right foot stays on the jug, implying that my body isn't on top of my hands, and thus my hands are still pulling rather than pushing. Q's brought his body up so high that his right foot doesn't have to do very much other than stabilize, which suggests that he has begun pushing his weight over the top of his hands. This is further supported by his lack of left foot on the lower section of the lip, whereas my left foot is clearly taking weight. Wet hands could certainly play a factor in determining when to push instead of pull.

#Some Takeaways

Although *One Last Dance* is well below our maximum difficulty, there are still things to learn from climbing it. For me, I think it served as a way to see why differences manifest themselves as success or failure on a particular route if the route is hard enough for both people. It also highlighted where compensations can be made, and why they are sometimes necessary. What is optimal for one person is less likely to be optimal for the next person as morphological differences grow larger. Climbing style preference played a large role in determining how Q and I were approaching longer moves, whether it be a greater degree of comfort in locking off in full extension or by deadpointing.

Climbing pace was fairly similar, up until the upper section. This difference was likely due to Q grabbing a wet hold and wanting to be cautious, though the height itself may have played a role in the degree of caution as well. It's a little high up there, and the landing is sloped!

Both myself and Q took our time weighting the left crimp near the start appropriately before moving anything else. This was to both get comfortable on the hold, and to safely weight it the proper amount for our respective sequences.

**Did I miss anything? Did you find it useful? Do you think I posted to stunt on the sub by spraying about sending a V4? Let me know! Maybe I can repeat this analysis style on a harder climb to see the result of forced beta changes, rather than selective ones based on intuition developed over the past decade. Some problems are mean enough to require everyone to do one sequence, as well, which makes for entertaining footage.**
Question: "The Janja Garnbret Move" physics Lately, Janja has been known for her crazy leg swing which shows up when she catches dynamic moves. I noticed the same leg motion with Akiyo (perhaps with a little less arc compared to Janja's). Here is a picture of what I mean below. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone help explain the 'use' of this leg arc? Is it beneficial to have a leg swing that is higher, faster... etc.? Is a more bent leg better, as it reduces the length of the pendulum and therefore force of the swing? Perhaps this question belongs elsewhere... but I'm curious to hear your opinions/experiences.

Comparison of the Effects of Three Hangboard Strength and Endurance Training Programs on Grip Endurance in Sport Climbers - EVA LOPEZ
How does nutrition factor into your efforts to climb harder? What have you cut out of your diet? What do you try to eat more? Any supplements? I realize I’m doing my old marathon diet to try to improve my climbing. Since they probably don’t correlate so well, wanted to hear what others have done to hone their nutrition.
How Much of Eric Hörst's New Podcast is Bullshit? Disclaimer: I started climbing in the past year, so there's a lot of training things I may not know yet, but I have a decent regular gym background and my bro-science-o-meter is going off.

Obviously everyone knows your tendon strength has much slower growth than muscle strength, I have heard quotes of 2-15x slower. Hörst claims there is a method to speed things along.

For those that want to listen to the podcast themselves: https://trainingforclimbing.com/podcast-33-training-stronger-tendons-ligaments/

Here's the breakdown:

Eric Hörst claims that there is a way to strengthen tendons quicker with the right nutrition. He goes on to cite several studies where they surgically removed some people's tendons after they had an accident and did tests on them to see which had to most growth over some stimulus. He then says that a new climbing supplement has come out that is one of its kind that will help you slowly build up your sinew strength and develop thicker tendons slowly. He also says that while the supplements are safe, the sports science community has not reached a consensus on whether or not the compounds actually work. 

The kicker: Eric Hörst is selling these supplements.

I know T4C is considered a generally reliable source of information when it comes to climbing harder. I was curious as to if you guys think he's telling the truth or not.
First go (of the day) best go? I have noticed that with my hard multi-day bouldering projects, nearly all of my sends have come within the first the 3 attempts of the day. I often send first go of the day even if it has been weeks between sessions. This has been the case with both 2 day and 20+ day projects.   


Does anyone have similar experiences? My goal is to knock out these projects a bit quicker and save my self a day. I'd appreciate any thoughts or advice.
Please teach me how to git gud at doing Drop Knees I understand the basic concept of dropping the knee to extend reach, but it doesn't feel right when I try it out. Generally my foot loses power when I initiate the drop knee. This causes my foot to slip. I think my technique is wrong and I'm not exactly sure what little tricks there are to make this move more useful.
  
Please help me learn how to do a solid and proper drop knee. Thanks yall, Average V5 climber
Is “just climb” really a good way to get better? I can redpoint a 6c (5.11b) and i would like to be able to RP 7a by next year, as I’ve got a few climbing trips planned. 
Essentially I really took the “just climb” advice to heart, thorough the winter I’ve just been going to the gym and “having fun”, not climbing in any structured way. Is this efficient, or should I have some kind of programme to follow?  

Also, most of my climbs are trying stuff that is probably too hard for me and I mainly spend 2 hours falling off a bunch on lead. Is this a good approach? Should I be trying to climb above my level to get better, or am I better off doing laps of an easier climb?
Fucked up, went too hard, now elbows hurt. Need to make the best of this. Hey my fellow rock inclined men and women. 

I’ve been climbing for about 2-3 years. Climb V4 outside and V7 inside. Haven’t put enough time into sport because I’ve been more of a trad man.  

I’ve been studying abroad in Kenya since January. Amazing time but had to take 3 months off climbing. I did Bechtels 3-6-9 ladders on my tension flash board to maintain a bit of finger strength. Did pull-ups, core, and climbed on whatever else I could.  Circumstances have allowed me to work at the Bluesky climbing gym in Nairobi for the last 4 weeks of the program. So basically I have 4 weeks (3 weeks left) of relatively unlimited time in this gym until I go home to my summer climbing season in Acadia. 

My problem:
Climbed way too much this first week and now my elbows are sore. I was dumb and I bouldered hard for two days and took a rest day and kept climbing hard did. I’ve had a pesky left elbow in the past but it’s always sorted itself out through time off and reverse wrist curls.  I’ve been doing strength training including hang-boarding for about a year. 

My question for you fine folks:
How do I best utilize these next three weeks while still climbing, and stay injury free, in order to be best prepared for my summer season?

Edit: I have a green theraband but I doubt its still strong enough and was just introduced to the Dodgy Elbows program.
Should I eat a full meal before or after climbing? the only time i can climb is at night, between 8-10.

i usually have a home cooked meal (rice, veggies, and a protein) with my family, then off the gym shortly after with maybe a banana or orange on the way.

i'm starting to wonder if i should change up my routine a bit.  should i eat a small snack (kind bar, banana) before i go to the gym, then a full meal after i get back?  but that would mean i go to bed on a full stomach, so not sure if that good or not.

i recently went to the gym at 5:00pm for a bouldering competition, with just a banana in my stomach and gatorade while I climb.  maybe it was the warm up or vibe but i had one of the my best sessions ever.  didn't feel tired after checking off 6-7 routes at 80% of my ability, and gave a good go on a few that were at my redpoint.  could've climbed a lot more routes but had to go.  does this have to do with the fact that I didn't eat a full meal before the gym?
Climb for efficiency or failure when training in the gym? Hey all, I have a semi-long standing argument with my gym training partner. For reference I'm leading 12a/b in the gym and 11a+ outdoors. My training goal is to push my outdoor onsight level.

&amp;#x200B;

We're (loosely) follow Kris Peters Power Endurance program and the point of contention is when we're doing sets of Easy/Hard laps. I'm a slow climber outdoors; I look for rests, chalk up, and try to find the most efficient sequence. This is how I often climb in the gym as well, even when doing drills/laps.

&amp;#x200B;

My partners viewpoint is that, with the goal of building power endurance, we should focus on climbing for speed and trying to push through the pump on each lap. Take less rests, push the upper limit of endurance.

&amp;#x200B;

My viewpoint is that I should train with the same style as I do outdoors, which is taking rests when I can and chalking up. Note that I'm not hang dogging or trying to avoid falling, it's just my preference. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am working on taking fewer rests when not efficient (on an overhang for ex) or planning ahead for what a good rest would be.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts?
B-Pump Ogikubo difficulty Has anyone here climbed in this Tokyo gym? I was in the area and decided to give it a go. Their grading system is based on the color of the tape: Yellow - v0-v1, Red - v1-v2, Blue, v2-v3, etc. I've been to many different gyms, and, on average, I would say I am a solid v5 climber. In b-pump ogikubo, I got shut down by half the Blues, and couldn't climbing anything beyond that. Very humbling experience. Also, the setting is so cool - literally almost every problem, even the easiest ones, incorporate some sort of toe/heel hook(s)/flashy dynos/etc. I couldn't actually find that many boulders that were just straightforward power/finger strength problems.

  


No wonder the Japanese climbers are so strong...Anyone else have a similar experience?
Your own outdoor vs indoor grade? I train in Sheffield England and have the lovely Peak District on the doorstep and the climbing works to train. I have been regularly sending a good number  V6-V8 outside. I have a good split off time on rock and inside. However I regularly out perform my indoor grade outside as do many off my peers even on days I'm not feeling fresh I'll be pretty unlucky not to send a V6-V7 outdoors. On the other hand if I get any off the V6-V9 circuit climbs inside it'll be one off my better if not best session indoors. I contribute this to wanting to perform outdoors as a priority and designing my training to emulate grit bouldering but doesn't 70 percent of people on here want to perform on rock? 

 During my regular lurking on here and looking at people flairs there is an opersite split and I regularly read post about people crushing V9 onwards indoors but their outdoor grades are V6 etc.

I would like to open a discussion on your personal performance indoors vs outdoors. Where do you think you perform best? Why is this? Are you happy with your split off performance? Is this just down to gym setting styles or grades being kind off arbitrary? Who knows? Do you? 

Let me know your thoughts?
Conscious individual finger recruitment Since starting no hang training earlier this year, I've noticed that I'll often catch myself pulling harder with some individual fingers than others on the same hand. For example, I'll struggle with a hang only to realize that my ring finger is not fully engaged; after I consciously try to 'pull' with that finger along with others the hang will feel significantly less difficult. As someone who has always felt that finger strength is my main weakness in breaking through to higher difficulty problems, is it possible that this is also happening during hard bouldering? Has anyone else experienced this and improved their climbing simply by consciously making an effort to pull harder with every finger?
John Kettle - Rock Climbing Technique Heard John Kettle on the Training Beta podcast talking about going from V7-V11 in a crazy short amount of time, mostly due to refining his technique and becoming really specific with his training. Seems like he had a really solid climbing base (mountain guide, regular climber) but it's still a meteoric rise through the grades. 

Sounds super inspiring, I've ordered the book, but wondering if any of you have read it/have any thoughts?
Movement and motivation w Keenan Takahashi I really enjoyed this interview with Keenan Takahashi:

[https://www.theprojectmagazine.com/features/keenan-takahashi-interview](https://www.theprojectmagazine.com/features/keenan-takahashi-interview)
Fairly strong climber but very weak in pull ups I’ve been climbing for about 2 years now, mostly bouldering indoors (total gym rat but the weather is getting nicer so I’ve been getting out- don’t hate). Indoors I can flash v5s, v6s go down within a few tries and I project v7s/working on my first v8. However, I can only do 6 unassisted pull ups. I thought I had pretty strong arms/back but clearly not. Would training pull ups give me a leg up and possibly help me send my first 8? Is this something I should even be concerned about? Sorry for the seemingly petty post, just curious as to what you guys think.
Training/lifting program for someone bored with current lifting program? First post here, please be gentle 

A bit of background, I’ve been bouldering for several years but haven’t ever been that serious about it.  I’ve also been lifting for a couple of years and have followed a couple of power lifting programs.  Recently I’ve started to get bored of my lifting program (3 days per week).  While I’ve been getting stronger it hasn’t particularly helped my climbing (2-3 days per week).  Part of it is obviously that I’m not climbing that much.

I’d like to switch to a lifting/training plan that is more focused on bouldering.  One thing I did like from my program is it gave me some structure so I’m definitely interested in that.  I also still would like to be building muscle.  Finally, becoming more flexible is something I’d like to do.

I have a couple of books to go through and I’ve bookmarked a couple of sites from reddit that have guides but I’m curious if any of you have recommendations for a structured program given my goals.

Thanks!
A question about breathing during hard moves So I'm basically a boulderer nowadays. I've noticed that I sometimes forget to breathe during hard moves. Now, I get it - breathing is good, and if you don't breathe, you won't have enough energy, especially later on in the route. But I wonder whether not breathing during particularly hard moves also serves some physiological purpose. Breathing isn't normally something which is under our conscious control. Normally, we don't need to 'remember' to breathe. The fact, then, that I'm forgetting to breathe makes me think that maybe there's some specific physiological reason that breathing might stop being automatic during hard moves. And I was wondering if you guys had any input, knowledge or ideas here.
How do you use your feet? Hi, I've always had a lingering question for the past year or so in my mind that I haven't been able to figure out myself:

Is it better to push or pull on footholds?

I've heard conflicting information on this. I've heard from some people that pulling on feet (trying to rip the foothold off of the wall) is better because it keeps you in the wall; I've also heard that pushing on feet (pushing perpendicular to the face of the foothold) generates more power. I made a diagram demonstrating the forces illustrated. Just want to hear some more opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

Yoga YouTube Recommendations Can anyone recommend a good yoga for climbers video? Ideally something suitable for a beginner boulderer, who has never done yoga before, and with a focus on leg flexibility and core strength. There are absolutely loads of videos around so I'm not sure where to start.

Thanks :)
How often should I do skills drills compared to projecting? I've wanted to start introducing skills drills to my routine as opposed to only projecting all the time. My question is how often should I do these compared to projecting?
Is my hang-board workout even helping me at all. Thanks for all the help with my previous post. I kinda want to talk about my hang board workout. Since I'm getting to the point of sending V7/8 inside and V5 outside and climbing 12a outside and 12d/13a inside I figured it was time to start doing hang board workouts to prevent me from hitting a plateau. 

About two months ago I did a bunch of research on hang board workouts. By the end my eyes were spinning and I was more confused then when I started. So I just started doing SOMETHING - while taking all the safety percausions. 

Here's what it looks like:

**WARM-UP**
1. 10min of jump roping to get the blood flowing; 10sec rest, 1min of burpees, 1min rest, 1min burps, 1min rest, 1min burpees. I'm fairly sweaty by the end of this. (I actually might be getting to the point of needing to do 2min, 1min rest, and 2min)
2. 15min of ARCing by traversing all different types of holds and different angled walls
3. Active stretching of all the joints

**WORKOUT:**
it's basically a 4x4 workout but just with fingers. I figured out what campus rung I could hold onto with my body weight with two hands for more than 10s but less than 18s (I think this is the standard?) turns out the 9mm edge fit the bill.

So I do two hands, 9mm edge, open-hand crimp {7s on, 1min off x4} 5min off} x4. I I think I heard Magnus Mitbø say he takes a big break between each rep in order not to get injured so I do the same. Totally workout is 112s. 

****I Edited my workout to include the fact that i do 4 sets of 4 reps for a total of 16 hangs.***


I was doing this for 2x a week, after a month boosted it to 3x a week. and would always do it at the beginning of my climbing sessions. I didn't always hang board in the last month because I've been climbing a lot more outside now.

This week, however, I've now added 5lbs/2.27Kg to the workout and plan on adding 5lbs/2.27Kg each month as it/if seams reasonable.

In the near future -- after the gym remodels -- I'm planning on incorporating one arm hangs but I do know how to include them into the workout.
Glycine supplementation for recovery? I work in aging biology, and a few weeks ago an interesting paper came out claiming that "Glycine supplementation extends lifespan of male and female mice." ([https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.12953](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.12953)) The paper is open-access, but TL;DR: the US National Institute on Aging (one section of the NIH) runs what it calls the Intervention Testing Program, which administers potentially useful compounds for protecting against aging to mice at three independent facilities in a double-blinded standardized format. When they upped mouse diet to 8% glycine by weight (from \~2% normally) both male and female mice lived \~5% longer.

I did some cursory digging, and found a lot of clickbait-y links advocating for glycine for bodybuilding, tendon repair, skin health in aging, and sleep quality. I pinged /u/KarlWalters, who commented that he'd tried it before he started climbing, and felt stronger taking it, but also felt sleepier &amp; slept longer; I've struggled with insomnia for \~2 decades so I figured that was probably an advantage, and ordered a kilo of it off Amazon.

I've been taking a heaping spoon (13g) of powdered, pure glycine mixed into water before going to sleep most evenings for the past \~3 weeks, and sometimes another blended into a smoothie in the afternoon at work. Two interesting things have happened.

* I do feel like I'm sleeping better, and according to my Fitbit I'm averaging an extra half hour or so a night (up from \~5.5h to \~6h per night, so still less than ideal).
* My fingers don't seem to tweak as easily; I'm not as sore after a session of crimpy bouldering, and once or twice when I've started to feel sore after a too-hard move, things feel fine the next day. In the past I've been \[unusually?\] prone to pulley injuries &amp; chronic finger soreness, and I can handle a much higher load of bouldering now without pain. This was much more surprising than the sleep benefit.

Glycine is a major component of collagen, which a lot of people seem to take for climbing-related soft tissue repair (and dietary collagen supplementation may enhance collagen repair in your body; results are unclear from the literature off Pubmed). Have any of you tried taking glycine vs hydrolyzed collagen? Anything interesting to report?
What was the single most effective exercise / practice that you added to your routine? For example, did you progress noticably faster after adding a specific exercise or drill to your training? Or maybe structuring your weekly schedule differently, a specific change in lifestyle, or training in a different setting / with different people?

I'm interesed to hear your stories!
What rest day activites do you do? Looking for tons of suggestions!!!  I currently only bike.  What does everyone else do?
Podcasts about training and progression Hi fellows !

&amp;#x200B;

I can listen to podcasts while working, and was wondering what are the ones talking about climbing and especially training. I've been listening to tons of them so I'm looking for more ! 

If you've got other ideas, let me know...  Could be stuff that isn't climbing related but that could be interesting in a training / progression / periodization way. I'm climbing a an honest level and got a sport science background, so it could be "in depth" stuff. Thanks !

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a list of those I already know:

\- Climb Sci

\- T4C / E. Horst

\- Power Company

\- Enormocast

\- Training Beta 

\- Thundercling

\- Lattice Training
How do you read routes? This is not so much a factor indoors where the holds are very obvious, but becomes an issue outdoors. I feel like reading routes properly is a big part of improving onsighting but I really suck at reading the rock and figuring out sequences from the ground. Even when I do plan from the ground, the route is often not how I imagined it and everything goes out of the window. Mostly I give up and just jump on the route and try to figure it out as I go, which makes me climb slowly/inefficiently.

What do you look out for when you look up at the route? Any tips to analyse the route before you set off? Thanks!
2 weeks off = worked great for me I had some tendinitis in my elbow and then had a backpacking trip. Total time from climbing/training/anything-but-hiking was 2 weeks. I went to the local crag this morning and was really happy. I expected to get my ass handed to me but instead I managed to do all my warmups and send a route I never have been able to do. 

It was weird but I noticed that I was climbing a little "differently" than I did a couple of weeks ago. Movements I didn't really try in certain positions I went into today and they worked. 

Plus my elbow feels great. So yeah, if you have to take some time off, don't sweat it.
What do you put in your very own workout space? Hi folks,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just over a month from moving into my own house. I've repurposed the garage to become part storage area (freezer and the likes), but most of it will become a workout space to become stronger and fitter (and hopefully lose some fat).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm intentionally not putting in a climbing wall yet. The kinds of walls I'd like are quite expensive (Tension board), the space is limited and I still need to figure out how (and if) it would fit, and by the end of the year I should have a brand new gym at about 25minutes from my house. I think I can get enough climbing in, so this space (for now) would be mostly for any additional training when my fingers and/or pulling muscles have had enough, or for active recovery days.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I had in mind so far:

&amp;#x200B;

* hangboard (on a little "case" thing so I don't hang against the wall)

  \* pinches and ball shapes underneath it, pulley system, and a phone (timer) holder, as a stretch goal

* pull up bar
* horizontal beams for TRX, gymnastic rings, and later on perhaps other things
* power rack and barbell and weights for some antagonist and core training
* box(es) for those crossfit style jumps (before you hate on me, my jumping power is extremely low, and I'm miles away from a pistol squat - these will help me train for those)
* some sort of semi-soft surface for ground work

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear what you all would put in a small garage (could barely contain a reasonable sized car). No need to keep budget in mind for now, although that would be a blocker for me personally even for the brilliant ideas (see: climbing wall)
Cant climb for serveral months because of injuriy. How do i create a good traninigplan to stay in shape or possibly even get stronger? Hey folks,

i had a fun experience last friday:

While climbing out some comp-style boulders in our Gym i had to do a dropknee in around 2m foot hight while climbing a slabby route and my kneecap decided to dont like the move and jumped out. I pushed myself as far away from the wall as i possibly could and landed on my back. The kneecap stayed in its unusual position throughout the fall and for a couple of minutes, until a doctor moved it back where it belonged. 

Well the problem is, that the doctor diagnosed me with trochlear dysplasia and i will have a big surgery in a couple of weeks, to fix the injured knee and prevent further problems with it. After that they will need to fix the other knee as well, because it has simmilar dissagreements with where the kneecap wants to be and where it should be. That means i wont be able to climb for a pretty long time.

So overall a pretty fucked up situation and now i want to train in the meantime to keep my physical progress or even get stronger, without using my legs too much.

My questien is how do i create a good traningplan to stay in shape and keep up with my mates? I never trained with a trainingplan or system and have no idea how and where to start.
Lattice climbing remote assessment So today I tried out the lattice remote assessment and was wondering if anybody wanted to commiserate about the lactate curve portion.  It’s been a few hours and I still have full body fatigue, like the day after a hard sports massage.

So a little numbers background: used the BM 1000 corners, I weigh 160 rn and hung almost exactly 5 seconds with one arm at bodyweight using each hand in both half crimp and open.  
So 60% of max should be ~BW + 30 lbs for 2 arms.  
My anaerobic time (10s on, 3 off, repeat till failure) was 136 seconds.  
However the aerobic section (7 on, 3 off, after failure rest as long as your work set was, repeat 8x) my curve went: 240 142 104 85 64 55 45 34.  

So this was pretty wildly different from all my friends who took it and the numbers I’ve seen online where everyone ranges between 100-30ish for their points.  
Plus all the video reviews and in-depth looks use the lattice board # of moves which I don’t think is easily comparable to times.  

Anybody do this as well? Did I just fuck up my max weight and should be stronger?
Is it my weight? I am trying to figure out why I've hit such a massive plateau. Some   background: I've been climbing consistently for about 7 years. I started   off sport climbing and progressed pretty quickly, gaining lots of   muscle and losing some weight. Over time I had to started improving my   technique and spent a lot of time bouldering and trad climbing. I've had   2 injuries during this time that put me out about 4-6 months each but   each time I came back and eventually gained the strength again. About 2   years ago I hit my high point in bouldering which is V5. At this point  I  pretty much only climbed outside. It was this point that I started  to  feel like I stopped improving. I would go out, climb a ton, train at   home, and still see little improvement. I would get frustrated (dumb I   know) when my friends and boyfriend who trained little to none, would   keep climbing through the grades, sending their projects every week or   so. I kept working hard and even started going to the climbing gym and   started training pretty consistently. I worked on my mental game and   stayed focused on improving. I am writing this because after working   hard for 7 months, I sent one project over the course of that time but   that was still only at V5. At this point, all of the people I was   climbing with before have gone up 2 to 3 grades and while I still climb   with them, we work on completely different climbs and its no longer as   enjoyable. I have been going over and over what I need to do next to   keep improving. My latest ah-ha has been my weight. I am female 5'5 and   weigh 134. I never spent much time thinking about weight because I   always felt that I was healthy, but when I do think about my friends,   they are all mostly taller than I and at about the same weight or less.   Is this my missing puzzle piece? I no there is no perfect answer but  I'm  just looking for some insight as to others experience and would  enjoy  some words of wisdom.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for giving me advice. This is just a reminder of why I love the climbing community so much.
What does your weekly training look like? Since summer is coming up soon and training is on a lot of people’s minds, what do your weekly training routines look like? (Also trying to draw some inspiration for myself)
Is weight lifting helping or hurting my overall bouldering ability? Hey guys/gals,

For background, I climb largely indoors due to where I live. From the few outdoor boulders I have climbed, and other’s more experienced opinion in the gym, our grading system is pretty comparable to outdoor grading. I’ve sent one or two V8s, most V6-7s, and I flash V4-5. Overall I’m happy with my progress, but I also enjoy dedicating time to weight lifting. This month, I decided to dedicate quite a lot of time to it since summer is coming up, and honestly, i feel like it has improved my climbing significantly. 

I’ve been in pretty decent shape so it’s not like I desperately needed to gain antagonist muscle, but the last month I’ve been really pushing myself on my lifts and have gained a decent amount of muscle (I still climb and work on fingers regularly). 

Overall, I feel more confident on a larger range of climbs. Weird body positions or movements that used to stump me are simpler now. My raw pulling power and general arm strength has also increased. 

My question is, is this increase in overall strength ultimately helping or hurting? I haven’t gained a lot of weight yet but I know that’s going to be a factor. Also, I find myself occasionally “muscling up” climbs, but I also feel like some harder climbs just require a really high strength to weight ratio. 

TLDR: Are gains in weight from non-targeted weight lifting and having the ability to “muscle up” climbs going to hurt my climbing ability?
Efficiently warming the hands up for at home hang boarding. Just looking for some tips on how to effectively warm up my hands if a climbing wall isn’t around me. I usually do playful easy hangs in different positions until they feel properly warmed up but I’m wondering if there are some specific warm-up exercises people have used to save time and be more consistent.

I would say I’m pretty confident in my ability to recognize when my hands are properly warmed up and ready to do intense exercises.
Best way to improve beta reading/footwork? I’m 15, 115 lbs, 5’7”, and I can consistently send 5.12s and v6/7s. My coaches have told me that my strength is ahead, but my beta is holding me back from improving. Does anyone have some good strategies or circuits for this?
Those who stopped/severly limited drinking with the sole purpose of climbing harder- How much did it help you? I'm considering either not drinking at all or strongly limiting my alcohol consumption this summer, mainly to climb harder. One of my long term goals is Starry Night at The Gallery, and I think that I'll need to lose around 10-15 pounds to help with it. (Currently weigh 170 lbs at 5'9, I have a muscular build, but slightly pudgier than I would prefer for pumpy, enduro, overhang climbing) While cutting alcohol is an easy way to cut calories and lose weight, I'm curious how cutting it has helped other people's climbing, aside from the weight loss aspect.
How to figure out a workout routine? I read the primer and saw the recommendations for "The Rock Climber's Training Manual", as well as “9 out of 10 Climbers Make the Same Mistakes”, and I plan on getting them both when I have more money, and when I think that I can actually commit myself to a training regimen.

My current plan is that I'll be climbing 3 days a week, with one day for circuits, one day for focusing on technique, and one day for projects/screwing around (because I also want to be able to have some fun while climbing). I also feel like I could reasonably devout 2 or 3 days to training, whether that's working out or something else. My question then, is how should I decide on what to do for my workouts? In particular I don't just want to train my climbing muscles, I also want to be sure I'm keeping my body even so I don't end up with problems later down the line. I'm also very hesitant to do any hangboarding, since I hear the risk of injury is very high if you're new-ish (I've been climbing for almost a 1.5-2 years).

Is there any advice you guys can give, or something else you can point me to for advice?

Thanks!

Edit: As a side note, how valuable is yoga for climbing? My gym has yoga classes coupled into the membership, so I'm curious. I imagine it could help a lot with flexibility and maybe strength (truthfully I don't know much about the benefits of yoga).
Go see a doctor. Your research online and past experiences are not always adequate. I heard a pop and a pain drive from my ring finger to my forearm. I figured it was probably an A2 or a partially torn flexor tendon that would heal naturally as I still had 90% mobility. 

I was planning on letting it heal on its own. But, because I had a climbing trip in Switzerland in 5 weeks, I decided to go to a hand specialist. 

It turns out that I was right. It was a partially torn A2.  The other thing that I found out was that my plate in my wrist (from a previous surgery in 2014) is rubbing up against tendons and greatly increasing the risk of ruptures. The doctor was amazed that I have not ruptured a tendon already, and he basically told me it is a matter of time before a tendon(s) ruptures. 

At the point of full rupture, as I’m sure most of you are aware, it is not 100% that one will regain movement post surgery (as my brother has found out with his most recent flexor tendon repair). 

So, no climbing in Switzerland. But, I will be getting a surgery that will limit the risk of hurting my future climbing. 

If you’re injured, go see a doctor (if your financial situation allows it).
Should I hangboard? Should I campus board? **Should I hangboard/fingerboard?**

Eva Lopez - [article link](http://en-eva-lopez.blogspot.com/2018/05/fingerboard-training-guide-i-preliminary-evaluation.html)

&gt; * 2 years climbing
&gt; * Good technique 
&gt; * Over 16 and past your growth spurt
&gt; * Injury-free
&gt; * Able to hang a 25mm edge for at least 15 seconds

Dave MacLeod - [article link](https://www.thebmc.co.uk/climb-skills-how-to-fingerboard)

&gt; * Difficult to apply a blanket minimum
&gt; * Very repetitive finger training before growth tails off, in late teens, has caused severe finger injuries.
&gt; * If the injury is healed enough to deal with the fingerboarding without getting worse, it's OK
&gt; * The real question is: are you fingerboarding when you'd be better off doing more bouldering?

**Should I campus board?**

Audry Morrison, Dr. Volker Schöffl - [article link](https://www.thebmc.co.uk/should-u18s-use-campus-boards-finger-injuries)

&gt; * Campus board use is not recommended for any climbers aged under 18.
&gt; * One study showed stunted growth in young climbers’ fingers
&gt; * In another study ofjunior competition climbers, two-thirds who trained regularly on the campus board hadfractured growth plates in a finger

Will Anglin - [article link](http://web.archive.org/web/20160107051234/http://willanglin.squarespace.com/climbingtraining/2015/12/31/campus-training-101)


&gt; Must meet all the following:

&gt; * Can easily perform 10 pull-ups on desired rung size
2019 sport climbing goals - progress so far A while back I asked for – and received – some advice regarding my [sport climbing goals for 2019]( https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/9x4gpq/training_advice_for_medium_term_6_to_9_month/), which to summarise were:

1.	a long endurance 7a on Kalymnos in May

2.	a shorter punchy power endurance 7b+ in the Frankenjura in the Autumn. 

Many thanks to all who replied with advice &amp; encouragement. /u/AlunAlun was kind enough to ask for an update on how it went, so here goes:

Just got back from Kalymnos and am staring out of my office window into the rain :-( The trip went well. I didn’t get on the particular route I had in mind – it’s on the Olympic Wall, which is a great sector but has one of the biggest uphill approach hikes on the island &amp; I wasn’t able to persuade anybody to go up there. But I did have a couple of successes on other 40 to 50 metre monster pitches at the same level, one of which was my first ever 7a flash. So I’m calling that a success.

Otoh I tried a couple of short, sharp, bouldery 7a/+ routes (even on Kalymnos there are a few) and got completely shut down on them. No surprises there given that I spent the entire winter mainly focused on endurance training. Did a reasonable amount of maintenance-level fingerboarding but much less bouldering than I intended. So it looks like it’s time to work on the power deficit now – a few weeks of moonboarding seem to be called for.
Climbing Faster Last week I noticed something which I've known for a long time, but never seen in action enough to make it become a focus. There was a guy and a girl doing the same route (6c+ approximately)- it was overhanging and juggy. The guy went up the pumpy section very fast with poor technique, but made it to the rest. The girl spent a long time, with great technique and ended up resting on the bolt but she HELD ON SO LONG. I was watching her climb, and she was clearly so strong! When she came down, she said she didn't have the strength for the route but to hold on for the time she did, trying different holds, 10 foot switches to make the moves smoother etc you'd have to be a beast to make it. 

We then did a test, I climbed (a 7a) up to the crux and through, then my friend (a guy) climbed the same section. It took me 1 minute longer on the first 7m of the climb than him, when I'm at the crux it's a total struggle because I'm so much more pumped and sometimes that extra little bit of energy is all you need. When I focus I can climb a lot faster, but the technique diminishes.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a thing? Do people train just going fast on routes? Any tips?
Am I wasting my time with weighted pull ups? Ive been doing weighted pull ups for 2 1/2 months twice a week for following a session of max hangs and approx 1 1/2 - 2 hrs hard/limit bouldering. 

I've been following the crimpd protocol of 5x5 with 3 mins rest between sets. I've gone from +13kg to +20kg in this time (BW 72kg) and find the gradual gains motivating! One of my weaknesses is powerful long dynamic moves and I want to improve this. A goal of mine is to be able to do a one armed pull up in the next year.

My question is: How much have people seen increases in weighted pull ups translate into performance on the wall? Would I be better off switching this exercise for muscle up progressions/uneven bodyweight pull ups?

Sorry for the ramble, cheers!
How long did it take you to be able to crimp micro holds (&lt;10mm), withstanding your body weight? How did you get to that point? Did you just naturally build the strength from smaller and smaller crimps from climbing? Or did you decide to use a pulley/take weight off and use a hangboard to specifically train this method?
Mental game Think I'm struggling with this. I seem to consistently fall off projects near the top/last move. This is despite having the ending down and having done the problem in two parts multiple times. Does anyone have any advice to not get so gripped at the top? I think its down to thinking about the finish when i get there and falling apart. Its like my focus goes, even though I'm still trying as hard as I can. Any advice at all to improve on sending would be much appreciated. Or any books I could read to help improve my mental game.
I've been thinking about the perception shift from pre to post-send... I've been thinking about the head game of climbing lately.  Especially how my perception of the climb can change so drastically from before the climb to after the send.  This weekend I jumped on two trad lines which were really good examples of this quantum shift.

**Example 1:** The first climb was a local sandbagged classic.  Its a 5.7 two pitch climb that has all this mystique around it from people saying stuff like "it's a 5.7 that climbs like a 5.10" or "the hardest 5.7 on the east coast".   Add to this, I watched a youtube video of someone climbing and taking a whipper on it.  So I started with all this fear built up that this line would be terrifying and ego crushingly hard.  I ended up jumping on it and it was so much fun.  Nothing hard at all.  A bolt in the 'scary' spot.  Great hands the whole way.  In fact, I couldn't find a crux.   I'm not sure how this guy pumped out and took a whipper.  The hands are all incut and footholds all the way.  Anyway, the point is I started with lots of anxiety and was very serious.  When I finished the climb I left thinking "I dont solo things, but if I did, this would be a great route to solo".

&amp;#x200B;

**Example 2:**  I went to a well revered old school trad area.  I received some beta from an old school hardman from the FA era there. He called the route I was jumping on a 5.9+.  His partner kind of rolled her eyes and said it was way harder than 5.9 and had three distinct cruxes on the two pitch route.  The first piece was probably 30' off the ground.  It was one of those deals where i spent so much time talking about it, I had to do it at that point.  So I jumped on it.  There were indeed three cruxes.  I was really terrified on all three. But the gear was really solid (although some of it was way below the move) and the moves were committing but totally doable.  Crux 1 a high step rock over with gear 5' below.   Crux 2 a really committing lieback with smeary feet.  gear right at your hands.  Crux 3 Traverse out a roof with great hands and disappearing feet.  Protect and go to turn a blind corner up to jugs.  I left this climb thinking it was so fun and I would love to come back and take other people up it now that I know its not that big of a deal.

&amp;#x200B;

**Example 3:** My climbing Gym has a semi permanent steep juggy climb that took me many times to send.   I used to be so scared of dropping clips and making moves.  Now it is like walking to the mailbox (mentally-speaking) even though i dont always send it and it's still a good workout.

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking about how my perception has changed so much from pre-send scary beta, mystique, seriousness, old school sand baggy spray, self-induced fear.  Post-send to "what's the big deal", " that climb was so fun", "I took a super fun whipper", "I would def solo that route", "I'd love to take my kids up that".  It occurs to me that I am probably making climbs I have never done so much harder by hyping up the fear in my mind (not talking x climbs here) .  A few take aways:

1. A positive mental attitude can be one of the best pieces on your rack.
2. Be confident in your abilities.  If you are solid at the grade, get on it and see for your self.
3. Stay calm and figure out the puzzle without assuming you are in deep doo doo.  Especially on classic routes.  They have been climbed so many times.  You know it will go.
4. Climbers love to hype shit up.  Be safe but take scary spray with a grain of salt.
5. One of my favorite feelings in the world is being terrified and persevering to the send. Cherish the fear as part of the experience.

What has your experience been with conquering and downgrading fear?
Tips to increase number of "max" send-attempts I was out climbing outside today on my project (V8, about 12 hand moves, 4 hard foot moves) and noticed I really only had about five burns where I had an honest shot at sending. Obviously there's a limit to the number of legit attempts you have on a climb, and it will also be specific to each climb and the movement type, but what are some ways to generally increase that number?
No hang with force output Set up this no hang fingerboard the other day, and I thought I would share it on here as I'm pretty impressed with it for the cost.  Prices are CAD.

Parts:

* 1 x Mini hangobard w. rope (I used one from digit climbing but there are others available) ($70)
* 1 x nylon climbing sling ($15)
* 1 x mini digital crane scale ($25)
* 2 x Carabiners ($15)
* Random piece of wood (priceless)

&amp;#x200B;

I pulled the forceplate out of the scale so the display faces upwards, which lets you easily hit the exact weight you need to on each pull. Seems a lot easier to me than mounting a pulley system under a hangboard IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/u5ivf07708031.jpg

EDIT: If you plan to set one up yourself, here is a bit of additional info for how to hack the scale...

* Remove the batteries and then unscrew the 4 screws on the back of the unit holding the plastic housing together
* Once its open the force plate should be sitting in the middle with a few wires attached to it with some kind of white adhesive material. Be careful not to damage the little wires, but go ahead and lift the plate out and set it next to the housing for now.
* At this point I would also recommend ripping off the tiny speaker (little black barrel shaped thing with a hole in the top) which is soldered to the top of the PCB as its only function is to make an annoyingly loud beep when you turn the scale on.
* Once you have that done run the force plate scale wires through the bottom of the scale. There should be a gap in the housing where the force plate used to sit.
* Reinstall the screws to secure the housing assembly back together
* Now all you have to do it stick the force plate to the bottom of the scale housing. I used some sugru that I let set over night once I knew the scale worked with the force plate pulled out, but you could probably use any other type of adhesive that would be strong enough (epoxy, etc). The adhesive just holds the housing in place so you can see the screen and isn't placed under load during training.
Any recommendations for antagonist exercises? I’ve heard that antagonist exercises can help avoid injury. I was thinking about starting to do push-ups and facepulls but are there any recommendations that you guys have for exercises?
How friction relates to training Lately I’ve been wondering about if/how friction plays a role in training. My question is basically this: between wooden holds (holds with low friction) and resin holds (holds with high friction), which is more efficient in building finger strength. I imagine two holds that are the exact same (edge size, angle, etc) except for one is made of wood and the other resin. Obviously the wooden one will be harder to hang off of, but does that make it a better finger strength training option? Does it make a difference?
Is it better to repeat "completed" boulders, or keep throwing yourself at new, harder, ones? Once I've sent a problem, I have a tendency to ignore it and focus on the next one that I haven't done yet. Should I be regularly repeating problems that I've already done?
The thundercling podcast has an interview with **TONY FRICKIN YANIRO**, the man who basically invented the entire modern attitude to climbing &amp; training. Haven't listened to it yet, but I struggle to see how it can possibly be anything but brilliant.
Pull Up Standards Hi, I've been climbing 3 years, sport around 12+, flash 12a, boulder outdoors around v4 (don't do enough of this), moonboard redpoint around v6. I'm mainly a sport climber, I'm a dude, I'm 27, I'm 5'10", I weigh 165lb. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can do 12 pull ups in a row. I can max pull up body weight + 60lbs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is that good enough to climb 5.13a, would this be considered a weakness I should focus on, or is time better spent else where. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen that Lattice says the gold standard is 150% body weight pull up, so I'm almost there... But I also see people able to rep 20 pull ups and I'd love to have that power. Power in general is my weakness. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been reading older posts and just can't seem to make up my mind. If you want to reply, maybe reply with pull up 1RM, max number of pull ups and your grade level! 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!
The deceptiveness of using climbing metrics like hand strength or pulling strength for evaluating climbing ability In quite a few threads recently, people are asking what must they do to get to a certain climbing level. For instance, one arm hanging the bottom middle rung of the BM2K is widely considered to be "V10 hand strength." Even [hangboard articles](https://www.99boulders.com/beginner-hangboard-training) make this mistake:

&gt; In all of the strength metrics measured by climbing coaches, the only one which has a strong correlation with the ability to boulder 8A (V11) is whether or not the climber can hang an 18mm edge with 1 arm.

This type of thinking is very deceptive to climbers that are weaker. What this means (for climbers that are weaker) is that if they get the same level of hand strength it is NOT a limiting factor (rather than a commonality that all V10 or V11 climbers should get to). 

[This WW2 armor plane example](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/09/counterintuitive-world/) that has been going around social media is perfect to illustrate what this means versus what it doesn't mean. The planes that made it back had bullet holes in certain areas means those were areas that were not critical to the failure of the plane when it was shot up. Armoring those areas would not improve the survivability rates of those planes because they were non-critical: those planes were making it back. Armoring the areas without bullet holes is vastly more important because those planes are not making it back when they get shot there.

Likewise, the fact that most V10 climbers could do one arm hangs on BM2K or V11 climbers can do one arm hangs on 18mm means that the limiting factors for climbers who get to this level of hand strength (but cannot send these grades) are elsewhere. Being able to one arm hang these standards is *more than sufficient* for V10/V11 climbing in those cases. To reiterate, hand strength is NOT a limiting factor for climbers to get to this level.

It's more often then not that V8-11 climbers are limited by technique first more than pulling strength or hand strength or core strength. However, if you know that you specifically have limitations in pulling, hand, or core strength then for sure work on those.

The same is true of other "standards" like weighted pullups or one arm pullups. Climbers like Dave Graham and Will Anglin can get to V13+ without being able to do one arms. Could they benefit from more pulling strength? Perhaps. But it's not a limiting factor that is affecting their ability to send hard. If one can do a one arm pullup they have more than sufficient strength for at least V10-11+. If you're A V6-9 climber, it's by far not a limiting factor. I know several V10-11 climbers that cannot do a one arm. Hence, a climber that can do this should not be focusing on improving their pulling strength but other areas of weakness.

**edit 3**: Adding this comment since it clarifies a bunch of confusion.

&gt; My analysis is not mutually exclusive with the fact that hand strength is strongly correlative.

&gt; Consider:

&gt; * A V8 climber who can one arm the BM2K bottom middle rung is **definitely not** limited by hand strength
&gt; * A V9 climber who can one arm the BM2K bottom middle rung is **not** limited by hand strength
&gt; * A V10 climber who can one arm the BM2K bottom middle rung is **probably not** limited by hand strength
&gt; * A V11 climber who can one arm the BM2K bottom middle rung (but not a smaller rung) **may** be limited by hand strength

&gt; On the other hand:

&gt; * A V9 climber who *can't* one arm the BM2K bottom middle rung **perhaps may be** limited by hand strength
&gt; * A V10 climber who *can't* one arm the BM2K bottom middle rung **may** be limited by hand strength
&gt; * A V11 climber who *can't* one arm the BM2K bottom middle rung is **very likely** limited by hand strength
&gt; * A V12 climber who *can't* one arm the BM2K bottom middle rung is **definitely** limited by hand strength

&gt; The main point is that BM2K as a standard for V10 hand strength or 18mm V11 means that it's not a limiting factor at that point. 

&gt; If you can't do it as a stronger than V10 climber you can be limited by hand strength. If you can do it as a weaker climber than V10 climber, you're probably not limited by hand strength.

&gt; These standards do not mean that you can climb that grade. They mean that when you hit that certain standard **it's not a weakness**.

If you get to these "standards" and you still cannot climb those grades, your climbing is definitely being limited by other factors rather than hand strength. You have more than sufficient hand strength but probably less than sufficient other areas.

**TLDR**

**This post is about understanding the utility benchmarks provide, not that benchmarks are bad.**

1. **It's great to work toward benchmarks.**
2. **If you hit benchmark it's not a weakness or limiting factor anymore.**
3. **If you still can't send in that grade range, you likely have other weaknesses you need to work on. Find them and work on them.**

----------------------------------

**edit**: fixed some grammar

**edit 2**: Since some people are misinterpreting what I'm trying to say I'll try to summarize:

* This post is not mutually exclusive with the known fact that hand strength has a strong correlation with climbing. (Also, see the point below).
* Benchmarks only show that something is not a limiting factor at a certain point. They still can show weaknesses if you don't have them or have them at certain grade levels. [See this comment for more details](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/bvag8w/the_deceptiveness_of_using_climbing_metrics_like/epnfgg8/). (This comment was added above).
* I like benchmarks. I use them regularly including the aforementioned BM2K bottom middle rung. They're useful to train so you know when you've encountered an area that is  *not a weakness* anymore.

edit 4: Added a TLDR for main point.
Two very basic stretches that drastically improved my hip/leg flexibility **Background**: I started doing these stretches about a year ago. At that time, lower-body flexibility was a significant weakness for me. Vert climb with a high foot? Forget it, I'd invariably just pull up awkwardly on the hands to get my foot high enough. Some kind of stemmy corner thing? Pass -- I couldn't touch it. I'd tried yoga before as a remedy, but I found classes hard and a pretty significant time commitment for something I actively disliked.

One year of exceedingly convenient stretches later, my high foot-ing and stemming is \*vastly\* improved. Stuff I couldn't imagine doing a year ago is easy, and more flexibility has really unlocked how I can use my feet and my awareness through my feet. My slab climbing, in particular, has gotten way better. I even enjoy climbing more now that I can do it in a more "multi-dimensional" way. 

**Stretches**:

1. For high feet: stand in front of some raised surface, like a table. Put one foot on the table (try not to use your hand to manually pull your foot up) and shift your weight forward on that high foot, feeling a stretch in your hamstring/hip. Lean back and repeat 20 times, then switch legs. One set each leg, twice a day, increasing the height of the table (or bike rack, or bench, or whatever) as things get easier. 
2. For hamstrings: With a similar surface, hike your foot up onto it with a straight leg so your toes are pointing toward the sky. Now slowly flex your foot toward you, so your toes are pointing toward your face, to stretch the hamstring. Same thing, 20 times each leg, twice a day, increasing height over time.

This takes maybe 5 minutes a day, and it's pretty easy to work into normal walking around. I'm not kidding, as someone who found yoga class horrible, these are \*easy\* stretches to get into. Nothing terribly novel, and likely most useful to someone with poor starting flexibility like me. But I wish I'd done it earlier! It's easily the biggest improvement:effort ratio of anything I've done for climbing, so I hope someone else gets something out of it.

Takeways/TLDR:

- Strength gains over the long term are all about increasing cross sectional area of your muscle. The bigger the muscle, the stronger it is.

- This is accomplished primarily by hypertrophy.

- Hypertrophy is accomplished best by volume &gt; 60% and less than 85% of max, intensity seems to not matter.

- This doesnt mean you should never do heavy singles. Just that your primary focus should be volume in that range to maximize your chances of meeting your long term strength potential.

- Everyone responds differently to strength training. Some bad responders need more volume.

- Deloading is a waste of time unless you want to peak for a meet/performance.

- Muscle confusion is also good for hypertrophy (changing rep schemes, exercises).

Obviously this is about powerlifting instead of hangboarding (isometric) but I thought it was interesting. It definitely seems like more of an RCTM style training would be beneficial over the long term.
Grade discrepancy between onsight and redpoint for you guys? Was just wondering what the grade difference was for you guys between onsight and redpoint? Feel free to be more detailed (e.g. one session redpoint vs multiple session)

Thanks!
WWYD - Metropolitan vs rural? My wife and I are contemplating if we should uproot our family and move to a somewhat remote island. Currently we're living in a city with a small climbing gym that we have 24H access to but there is no outdoor climbing close by, which means that our outdoor climbing is limited to a few trips per year due to being busy with kids and work. The living expenses are high which means that we both have to work full time(+) and have a 20-40 min commute each way.  

  

We're considering moving to a somewhat remote island within our country. It's the only place that has actual outdoor climbing in our country. About 100 boulders, 100 sport climbs, a little ice climbing and lots of trad. There is no real indoor climbing community on the island which means that my climbing, when the weather is bad, will be limited to a tension board and a hangboard. The added benefit is that living expenses are around 1/4-1/3 of what we're currently spending, which would allow us to both work part time and spend more time with our kids as well as more time climbing, kayaking and doing other hobbies.  

  

Right now we have family and friends very close and if we decide to move away, we won't have grandparents to babysit or friends that'll just drop by and hang out. But instead we'll have lots of freedom and time to spend with our kids as well as lots of outdoor climbing right outside our doors.  

  

What would you do?
Does moving into sport climbing for a while reduce bouldering progress/fitness? So I've been almost solely a boulderer for about 7.5 years now.  My big goal is to climb a V10, but i've been stuck around V8-9 for a couple of years now.  The lack of progress is starting to take a mental toll honestly, so I'm thinking I'm just going to have some fun on a rope for a few months to get away from the pressure and grade chasing (self-imposed obviously).  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if as long as I keep up with hangboarding and some power/campus style exercises while i do this if it I'll be at the same bouldering strength/fitness when I come back to it.  I'm mostly unclear on how endurance-based climbing impacts my body's capacity for power-based climbing.  Is it mostly a mental state that you just have to get back into in a couple of weeks or is there something physiologically that changes?
Good exercises to do on non-climbing days? I climb three times a week and do my core, press ups and some squats (my legs are weak) at home on rest days. Are there any other exercises I could add that would specifically help with climbing?

What kind of weekly routines do you guys follow? 

I have been climbing for 8 months and am around V4-5 if that makes a difference.
Simulation of crux in boulder gym So, I know this is an often used tactic, I'm about to try this for the first time. I also don't really have any routebuilding experience, but have permission (and supervision) from the gyms lead setter to replicate the crux moves of an outdoor route on the system wall.

People who have used this tactic before, what are some pointers to make this process smoother and more likely to work?

I was thinking of starting with replicating the moves in a categorical way and when I start to get them down, gradually swapping holds for worse ones and/or putting them further apart. But putting them further apart sounds like a pain in the ass because if you make the first move longer, all following holds have to shift up?

What about risk of injury from repetitive movements?
Outdoor-only bouldering for a very soft boulderer? I have what many might call the exact opposite of a problem: I just moved to a place that’s 10 minutes away from some outdoor bouldering. The nearest gym is about 2 hours away, so it’s very unlikely I’ll be visiting that. 

Problem is, most of my outdoor experience has been in sport and trad, and the few times I’ve attempted to boulder outdoors I’ve been shut down by very easy problems. (Not that this is necessarily an issue, I’m more than willing to project things!)

My concern is that only getting one or two moves in on even the easiest of problems will mean a loss in strength and ability, and by not being able to actually fully climb anything, it’ll be pointless training. (Think maybe the same as repeatedly trying that problem that’s several grades above you and you can’t even get the first move for: there’s no harm in trying and learning, but when it comes down to it it’s nicer to project a thing that you might struggle on but eventually get up).

So I guess my question is: what’s the best way to train in an outdoors-only setting, when you don’t think you’ll be able to do most of the climbs? Are my worries about not making progress even a real situation, or have I just got no idea about how progress actually happens? Any advice is much appreciated!
Open hand, crimp, and drag * I have a question about the utility of the crimp. Maybe I'm missing something, but I thought the point of crimp was that it's stronger than open hand. If your open hand is stronger than your crimp, why do you even need/want to crimp given that it's said to be higher injury risk?
* Is the hyperextension of DIP joints during crimps harmful?
* Is 'drag' the same thing as open hand, because that's what it looks like from context on posts here? Googling was not helpful because it results in drag queens and drag cars.
Beginning this year, I started collecting data of bouldering sessions. Here is what I have so far. Let me know your thoughts, other metrics that may be interesting to investigate, etc.
What should my hangboard routine look like? I am a v5 climber that doesn't have access to a gym during the summer. this means I can't climb for 3 months so I decided to get a hangboard to help maintain myself during the offseason.

&amp;#x200B;

I bought a Trango rock prodigy training center

&amp;#x200B;

how do I go about creating a routine? How do I determine what grip positions would be best?
Static training tips - no more dynos I tend to move dynamically on the wall, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but there are times when static strength is required, as well as just generally balancing out my strengths. Any training exercises to help force more static moves/build static strength?
Why is one armed hangs/pull ups easier? I think it's generally accepted that if you can hold around 50-60% bodyweight on a 2 handed hang, you can switch over to one arm work and most people can hold one arm even though they can't do the same edge with 100% BW added. The same is also true for OAP, it seems much more difficult to pull 100% BW than to do a OAP. I'm pretty close to a OAP, but I can probably only do +60% (Only tried 2 rep max and could only do +50%) for weighted pull ups. I take around 5-8kg off for one armed work which means I'm holding (10s beastmaker 1000 18mm edge) around 55kg (63-8), which is around 87% of my bodyweight with one arm, but I can probably only do around 30kg on the same edge or around 150% bodyweight, so split between my arms, around 75% each.  


Why is one armed work easier? Is it because when you hang weight from a harness the center of gravity changes? Is it because a lot of the 'weight' on one arm work is actually in your arm and hand and it's much closer to the actual 'anchor' point? With one arm you still need to control the rotation which makes it harder, but seems like OAP or one-armed hang on any edge does not translate to +100% BW. Something I've always been curious about, or am I the only one that feels like this?
Share your training mini-hacks So everyone here most likely sleeps, eats, drinks, and dreams climbing hard.  I like to use any bit of time I have free to myself (driving, etc) to help me with climbing.  For example:  when brushing my teeth, I keep one foot on the counter and get a nice hamstring stretch.  Recently I bought some hand-bands that I will be using while driving, etc.

What stuff do you do that's similar?  Would love to know!!!
How to do ARC training without hogging the wall? Going through the Rock Climber's Training Manual now that I've reached the 1 year mark and want to start taking my training seriously. ARCing sounds interesting, and I guess the best way to do it would be to either traverse the bouldering wall back and forth or jumping on the auto belay. 

The thing is, I feel like by doing either of those things for 1 hour + (2x 30 minutes with only a couple of minutes in between)I'm going to be annoying other gym goers.

So how do you go about your ARC training?
Other Hobbies of Climbing Fanatics? This is not related at all to training but I wanted to ask people who were obsessed about climbing a question and this seemed like the right place to do it. 

What are your other hobbies? Anything - Does not have to be climbing related or even a physical hobby. I often wish I had something else in my life I enjoyed as much as climbing that I could do at any moment.

Just to get the ball rolling; my other main hobbies would be experiencing live music, programming and biking - but none give me the same satisfaction that climbing does.
Don't Skip Leg Day? Hello Everyone,

I've heard many climbers suggest that excessive leg weight is a hindrance when engaging in more traditional forms of climbing.  However as a chicken-legged guy, I've noticed that despite my steady gains in most other facets of my climbing, I often struggle with indoor comp style slab problems - not the kind with crimps and small footholds (though those can certainly be hard), but the chunkier volume problems that often require coordination/horizontal dynos, one-legged squats, etc.  My thunder-thighed and captain-calfed friends tend to get through these more unconventional problems with ease.

Aside from squats and deadlifts with moderate weight (I try not to push too hard out of fear of injury), what are some recommendations to improve leg strength as it relates to this sort of climbing?  Has anyone made gains specifically in this regard?
Tendons! So i had a pretty interesting chat with a researcher in neurophysiology a couple days ago. He climbs pretty hard too (i guess about 8A) and said i shouldnt worry too much about tendons since they just need time to adapt and he, too had hurting pulleys for the 1st 10 years of his climbing, but never since then (his tendons now are so big he cant close his fingers completely because of soft-tissue inhibition).

&amp;#x200B;

he also said there are a couple thing you can actually do to support building strong tendons.

&amp;#x200B;

Since Collagen in the body is a triple helix and the turn to build it needs Prolin (the only aminacid that can turn the chain of the aminoacid for about 90° (in this case 2 of the prolins for a full turn)) a full amino acid profile is very vital. (he also said that 90% of the Collagen that i supplement are still in my stool and dont get absorbed).

Also Vitamin C is essential for this.

and the thing i didnt know about Vit. C is that its half-value period is only 12 hours, so you should be eating a Vit. C rich food 3 times a day to fully use the time the tendons can be rebuild/build.

I didnt check these things, even tho i study nutritional science im just short of the 1st chemics exam and not even close with the biochemics one, so my own understanding is limited right now. I just thought you guys would find atleast the thing with Vit. C interesting and helpful.

if something i wrote is wrong please let me know
Has Eric Horst Turned Into A Shill? Seems to me like his podcast has turned into an hours long advertisement for supplements. Is there some actual science behind all those?
Road to V8/5.13a. Climbing assessments and starting metrics My long-term goals in climbing are V8 and 5.13a (along with just becoming a better climber and enjoying it along the way).  I'd like to climb V6 and 5.12a before the end of the year.  I'm currently:

Age:  34

Climbing:  5-6 years

Training:  ~6 months (two 3month cycles, both over a year ago).

Weight: 182lbs / 83kg

Height: 6'2"

Ape Index:  1"

Lead Redpoint:  5.11d

Bouldering:  V5

I'm just getting back into training (I've only done two 3-month bouldering plans from PCC), had to take a year off due to some tendinitis.  I was thinking about doing the Lattice Training assessment to see what my areas of strengths and weaknesses were.  I'm currently on summer break (working in education), so I have lots of time to spend climbing outdoors.  I'll be follow a nonlinear progression format, with sessions that focus on strength (fingers/antagonists), limit bouldering, and endurance (lots of laps at lower grades).  

I was wondering what the feedback is on the Lattice Assessment.  Would someone like myself benefit from this type of assessment or am I at the level where as long as I stick to a training plan I can just expect decent gains across the board.  Also, currently I'm having trouble figuring out how to squeeze in a "redpoint" session, a session that would focus on building up mental strength and redpoint tactics (good rests, good pacing based on the route, route reading etc.).  Finally, not sure if my weight is an issue.  I'm fairly fit, and am estimating my body fat around 10-12%.

Thanks for any feedback.
How do I get cut without losing muscle I have been eating at a caloric deficit for a few weeks and have dropped a few points of body fat percentage. I am just concerned I may also lose some muscle. The advice online on cutting tends to be focused on body building where they state it is important to keep lifting with heavy weights. How does this advice translate for climbers? 

Also, how hard is it to stay cut all year around? I don’t mean abs so chiseled you can eat off them but pretty nice looking with lower abs just about visible. 

I admit I want this for aesthetic reasons but also I don’t want to lose muscle or climbing ability in process. If it makes a difference, I am about 68kg at around 14~18% body fat at 176cm. Thanks.

Edit: I only do bouldering if that makes a difference. (Because I love it)
Training for the schedule-averse. 28 years old
Climbing 6 years mostly sport, RP best = 13a 
Goal: 13c/d in late September/early October 

I've decided to dive into a 16 week training block over the summer while it's hot lava at my home crag. I've never worked with huge amounts of volume, and getting into a serious programme seemed intimidating due to potential time constraints. I like a flexible schedule, and I like putting effort in as I'm able to.

I spent my spring getting comfortable at my hardest RP achieved last fall, climbing 6 climbs 12d-13a in 6 weeks sending in &lt;10 attempts.

I've split my training into 7 weeks each of strength work and power, followed by 2 weeks of PE to hopefully optimize before the fall. Right now, I'm on week 4 of 7 str. and finding my method works really well for my personality type so I thought I would share.

Rather than having a solid weekly schedule, I've built myself a checklist of items I would like to achieve. This has a tolerance of -2 tasks, meaning I aim to achieve all facets, but have forgiveness if I miss at most 2 each week. As I complete the workout, I log it and check it off my list. I've found it very encouraging, and haven't felt pressured by it one bit. Best of all, it allows me the flexibility to maintain my relationship with my spouse, and work/run my business whilst training and not feel rushed.

For those who are curious my weekly tick list looks like:

Weighted pullups  
Weighted pullups  
Weighted pullups  
Max hangboard (10sec/3minx5, HC, 123, 234)  
Max hangboard (10sec/3minx5, HC, 123, 234)  
Limit bouldering/hard routes (no aim to send)  
Limit bouldering/hard routes (no aim to send)  
Core  
Core  
Core  
Weights (3-5 rep, heavy efforts)  
Weights (3-5 rep, heavy efforts)  

Any of these can be coupled with others (generally weighted pull ups, weights, and core) and can be done on any day of the week. I keep a special eye on what feels optimal that day, and what my schedule can accommodate. Also worth mentioning; both of my climbing days are outdoors right now. While it's hot as hell, the gym in my town sucks and I can be at hard boulders or routes in 15 minutes. This, coupled with the fact that I'm not aiming to send, just pull hard moves makes it far more appealing to climb outside.


This isn't saying it's the perfect programme, but I am certainly getting much stronger. I just find that most people I hear speaking of their training have a hard time with the scheduling of it and I think my solution is pretty savvy. 

If anybody has input or questions, they are more than welcome.

Thanks
Is it more advantageous to push yourself in bouldering in your younger years and worry about climbing trad after you get to your late 20s with a solid basis of strength? I know that many climbers don't hit their max grade until well into their 30s and sometimes later, but I've been reading/listening to interviews where some pros, in particular, Alex Honnold, have sort of wished they would have bouldered more and climbed more hard sport when they were younger, rather than focus on bigger objectives (that tend to be really long trad climbs) that might still be hard and impressive, but not necessarily pushing 5.16 or something. There was a similar discussion on the bad beta podcast one time about this 17 year old kid on the evolv team was crushing some really hard route, and when asked if he climbs trad, he was just like "I can do that when I'm old"

My question, is that is it better for someone younger and in their first couple of years climbing to continue pushing their sport grade to build that solid foundation, of skill and strength, or to begin trad climbing and get good at that? I know it depends on what one wants to specialize in, but if the goal is to be a well rounded climber, then I'm curious as to what one would focus on

For my own personal consideration, I can onsight most 5.10 sport climbs I try, but am only really comfortable with like 5.7 trad. I feel like it'd be really cool to free climb cool big hard objectives that tend to not be protected by bolts. many of the worthwhile ones, for example in the Sierras or Yosemite are at grades of like 5.11, which one would likely need to be comfortable onsighting. I guess this gets to the broader question of what projects we are ultimately training to do, but yeah. What are y'alls thoughts?
Is it ever optimal to climb with your hips facing the wall? I hear a lot of people say to try to twist your hips in to the wall to keep you center of gravity closer and it does make a big difference, but sometimes I see climbers far better than be climbing frontal to the wall. Is this ever an advantage? Usually when I see good climbers do this it is on steep overhanging routes. Any input on this? Thanks.
Foundational Body Position for Square Movement I've posted these before and seen the blog linked, but with the recent thread about square movement I thought this was worth revisiting. Rob Mullgian has a very detailed break down about thoughts on movement, positioning and how hold types affect the ideal position.  I would be interested to hear others opinions on these.

A separate but related note on efficiency:

 [https://joshuatreebouldering.wordpress.com/2014/09/30/a-followup-part-3-efficiency/](https://joshuatreebouldering.wordpress.com/2014/09/30/a-followup-part-3-efficiency/)
Progress in the Office Hi all, I work 10 hrs a day in an office setting and I am trying to find ways to do minor workouts at the office to supplement my training outside of work. I have been climbing for years but have only recently been trying to push to improve. I understand I wont see great improvement just from this but I feel like anything is better than nothing. Any suggestions?
If you lift weights for climbing, how much should you lift? I have read a bunch of conflicting advice about lifting for climbing, and just wondering what other actually people do (as opposed to what you've read is best), particularly the max when you've been doing it a long time. I'm particularly interested in the barbell compound lifts - squat, deadlift and bench press. Obviously as a climber you don't want to be doing too heavy or too much lifting of these exercises, but what is too much? Do you limit yourself by weight or volume (or both). If there are weights you do, (especially related to general strength, stabilisers and antagonists), I'd be interested to hear that too :)
Tips/suggestions for these kind of deadpoint-y pocket moves? I feel like I don’t have enough “hang time” at the top of my swing/movement to accurately catch the pocket. I’m thinking I need to flag harder and work on my pocket technique more in general (i.e. not contracting the unused fingers).
Not sure if this belongs here, but its improtant and not just for depression, but for general health. And like he saids nutrition is something everyone should educate themselfs and not just listen to conclusions people on say, but actually try and experminent for themselfs. Dave McLeods latest Vlog
Steve House: most mountain athletes, especially beginners and intermediate-level, can make bigger gains by improving technique than they can by improving fitness
Joint splits can be a pain to heal as they reopen when you bend your finger. I couldn't find any info on how to heal them, so I made a video to explain the process! Save this for when you get one, it'll save weeks of frustration
How do I maximize my recovery? I try to climb 3 days a week (Sunday, Wednesday, Friday), and do antagonistic training two days a week (Tuesday, Thursday).

My two big questions are: "How do I maximize recovery post climbing?", and "How do I maximize recovery on non-climbing/workout days?". 

For the first question most of my research seems to just say "Stretch post session, roll out post session, and eat some protein.". Maybe this enough, but is there anything else I should be doing to help say my tendons, or anything else?

For the second question I wasn't really able to find anything, though maybe my google-fu simply isn't good enough. When I have a total rest day (no workout or climbing) is there anything I can do to help recovery even more?

Thanks!
Opposition Training Hey Climbing Pros,

When you’re doing opposition training, do you do it the same day that you’re climbing, or do you alternate between climbing days, and opposition muscle days to give your muscles time to recover? 

For me, the problem is my pecks and upper back. I do push-ups every time I go to the gym and I feel like it results in both sides getting swollen and tightening on each other, which gives me a whole bunch of back pain.

Any tips appreciated!!
Pinch problems? Hey guys and gals, I’m running into a problem I’ve had since I’ve started climbing.  Sometimes when I pinch certain ways there is a burning sensation along the outside of my left thumb. I’m pretty sure there is a tendon or ligament of some sort running along that path and when I readjust it goes away most of the time. I don’t push it as obviously that’s a warning sign to me. 

I wanted to know if others have encountered this and what they did that helped. Also I will go to a hand specialist to get it checked. I don’t want to blow a thumb tendon. That would suck.
V7 climber, stopped making progress a few months ago. looking for some good resources for training and recovery. I'm very strong on slopers, big shouldery moves, heel hooks, hip mobility, and lock off ability,

I need to work on crimp strength, endurance, explosive power, core strength, and balance. 

Looking for a training routine that will take care of at least some of those weaknesses.


I climb one or two times a week in a gym. I boulder, top rope, and lead, my gym has a moonboard but i don't utilize it enough. 

I'm not doing anything except for climbing right now but i have access to weights, a rowing machine and a hangboard at my climbing gym and will soon have a hangboard at my office too.

recovery has also become an issue for me i have foam rollers and try to use them but i feel like i have no idea what i'm doing, same thing with stretching.

any resources that come to mind would be much appreciated, a well outlined regimen would be the best thing for me right now though.
2019 Goals Check In As /u/slainthorny suggested, here is a check in thread for the 2019 goals thread I started in January.  We're half way through the year so let's hear what you've been working on, accomplished, struggled on, etc.  

Link to the original thread in case you need to check up on your goals: [2019 Goals Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/abma8q/2019_goals_thread/)

Edit: I waited until I got home from setting/coaching to read through all of these comments.  Definitely am more psyched now and very happy with how this is turning out.  Everyone seems to be killing the game so far and we've still got 6 months to go.  Keep up with all the great work and we'll do one last check in on 12/31!
Returning to climbing after a Spinal Cord Injury **I want to talk about things I can do going forward for my upper body.** I'm figuring out my legs as time goes on and they slowly get better. That's just something I have to figure out on my own. I'm here to pick your brain about upper body training. 

I have an incomplete spinal cord injury from a climbing accident this past December. My doc has cleared me to start climbing again and it has been so good to be getting back to it. I am an incomplete paraplegic so I'm slowly regaining more control and strength in my legs but I currently have no control of my feet (so they just flop around and fall off of small holds).

Previously I was a decent climber (5.10a lead outdoors, 5.11 lead in the gym) but I wasn't anything fantastic. I generally tried to focus as much as possible on legwork to make it easier on my arms. Now when I'm climbing I try to use my legs as much as I am able, but due to my poor leg control I have to change my climbing style to focus more on explosive and dynamic arm power since I can't get the power out of my legs. I've only been back at it for a month and am currently climbing 5.7/5.8 and I'm improving rapidly as I figure out how to best utilize my floppy legs and feet.

Anyone have any tips or suggestions for training my upper body and learning a new climbing style?

**EDIT: Since people were asking about my injury I decided to add a bit of background.**

On December 1st 2018 I was leading a route at my gym and about 30 ft up. I tried to make the next clip, couldn't make it, and fell. It should have been a safe fall but it wasn't. I decked, landing on my belay device, and burst my T12 vertebrae and fractured my L1 and L2. I had spinal fusion on L1-T11 and was in the ICU for 10 days and inpatient rehab for 4 weeks. My injury level is defined as an L1 incomplete so the spinal cord was not completely severed and has a good shot at healing.

I've regained a lot of control and sensation since then but its incredibly slow because nerves heal stupidly slow. I primarily use a wheelchair but I can walk some with a walker and am working on progressing towards walking with forearm crutches. I've got a good shot at being able to walk without an assistive device eventually but there are no guarantees on what I will or will not get back. I've learned to drive with hand controls and recently started returning to both work and climbing. I have physical therapy twice a week and pelvic floor therapy (to try to regain bladder and bowel control) once a month.

Currently my major muscle weaknesses (due to both nerve damage and atrophy) are glutes, hip abductors, hip flexors, hamstrings, and a whole bunch of the smaller muscles in the hips (ie, I'm not able to internally rotate my right leg when my knee is extended). I also have zero muscle control over my ankles but every now and then I see what might be a contraction in my tibia anterior (shin muscle). Really, the only fully functional muscles below my waist are my quads and hip adductors.

**Regarding why I decked:**

I've talked to my belayer a lot since that day. We've both thought about it so much that neithter of us are exactly sure what happened. I was attempting to high-clip a little bit but not too egregiously. He was standing a little far back from the wall so there was more rope to stretch than there should have been. There was probably a little too much slack in the rope as well. Personally I don't think it was one specific reason. I think it was the combination of smaller, harder to notice things. If it wasn't for my belay device getting trapped under my back I likely would have gotten up and walked away with just a broken sternum. My belayer is one of my closest friends. He was before this accident and he is now. I'm climbing with him again as well. He fucked up, that's undeniable. But now he is keenly aware of what can happen during a momentary lapse of attention to details. And because of that I trust him more than anyone else to belay me. Yeah, this shouldn't have happened. But it did. There is no point in thinking of all of the hypothetical situations about how it could have gone worse or better.
Climbing Doubt I have this issue with completing routes that is a lot more mental than physical.
Every time i finish a project at my max grade, it feels like that route is easier in retrospect
I end up telling myself, "You've only done easy routes up to now, so you're still as terrible as when you began."
Has anyone else experienced this?
First, thank you to everyone for all the positive comments on the training book I posted earlier this year! I finally finished the second edition; it has some new info and, I think, a much better presentation. Again, its free (donation basis), my thank you to the climbing community! Hope you enjoy!
Yoga in relation to training I’m currently in a rest and recovery period about to start my training regiment again. Yoga has been an incredible pairing with climbing for me as it helps with my mobility, flexibility and general muscle stabilization. 

I’m curious about your thoughts on the best time to do my yoga in relation to a training sessions to get the best bang for my buck. 

Please correct me if I am wrong but, my understanding is that “stretching” after a session is best no matter if you do it 10-30 minutes after or some hours later. However I am curious about morning yoga sessions followed by evening training sessions?

I am a elementary school teacher so my idea here is to do my yoga in the mornings before work and my training after, should that switch? Does it matter?

Thanks for reading this and keep climbing hard!
Is one hangboarding exercise per session enough to make strength gains? I just started doing the max hangs exercise on the Crimpd app. So far I've only done two sessions but was thinking about doing this 2 times per week. 

The exercise is 10 seconds on and 2 minutes off for 6 sets. So a total of one minute hanging at 90% of your max weight. I was wondering if this is enough to become stronger or if more stimulation is needed?
Balance between climbing and weight training. Earlier this year I tried bouldering and fell in love. Previously I have been going to a regular gym, solely to build muscle and gain weight. Bodybuilding has never been interesting to me. But I did it in an attempt to create a body I would be proud of. And to get stronger, relative to my bodyweight. First year I gained 15 kilograms, finally within a healthy bmi. Now I am 21 years old, I weigh 57 kilograms, 175 cm tall. My perceived goal would be to hit 70 kilograms. I do not want to be big and bulky, but simply not skinny and relatively muscular.

I am sure you get this question often, and so I do apologize. I just want to make sure. How plausible would my goal be to build muscle and hit my weight target, while focusing on learning to climb?

I was thinking to see a climbing session as a "pull workout". Do that two or three times a week. With climbing specific exercises at the end. For example weighted pull-ups, front lever progression and dragon flag progression. And then in-between climbing sessions do a "push workout". Probably two times a week. Some weighted dips, one-armed push up progression, pistol squats and perhaps exercises like reverse curls for injury prevention, in terms of training antagonistic muscle groups to climbing.

Would this setup be able to satisfy my goals?

1. Get better at climbing (strength and technique).

2. Build an all around functional body.

3. Build muscle up to a certain limit.

4. Prevent injuries.

I do not aim to become a competitive climber. All I want is to shift my focus towards something functional. Because bodybuilding does not get me hyped. And I feel it feeds the perception in my mind, that I am not good enough. Do you think this approach would work?

Obviously eating in a caloric surplus and training hard whenever I am working out.

Please give me feedback if you have any. For example exercises that would be a good idea, in terms of climbing. Dips for mantles, pistol squats for leg work, perhaps some hamstring work for heel hooks, etc.

Thank you so much!
Climbing-centric exercises that require no equipment, just my meat sack? So I’m going to be leaving on a 2-3 month bike tour and won’t have the means to climb at all, nor will I take any exercise equipment. While I’m uber excited for the tour, I’ve fallen in love with climbing since I started a little less than a year ago and am nervous I’m going to regress quite a bit due to not climbing for 3 months. 

Currently I mostly boulder and climb v4 and the project v5’s, and if I top rope I’m climbing 5.10s with ease for the most part and project low 5.11s. From what I’ve read, specific exercises aren’t super relevant until v6ish and until then it’s just a matter of actually climbing and acquiring technique. Sadly, I won’t be able to do that. So I’m wondering what exercises I can do to at least become physically stronger while I’m on tour, and then when I get back just climb a lot and hopefully technique will come back to me. I’ll be biking an avg of 50 miles a day, so that’ll obviously be good for something, but I’d love to know climbing specific exercises that I can do at camp every night. thanks in advance for reading this :)
Overcoming the fear of clipping When I first started leading, I was already a little nervous about clipping on lead, but it wasn't a big deal. Shortly after, I was in the gym clipping the third bolt, and as I was pushing the rope through the gate (read:slack out), the foothold spun and off I went to the deck. Luckily I was completely uninjured. However, I now have a subconscious fear of clipping, especially in strenuous positions. I've found myself in places where I absolutely know that I ha e the physical and technical capabilities to make a clip, but if it's at all strenuous, I get nervous. I've found myself backing off of climbs because I'm afraid of blowing the clip, even though I am absolutely positive I can make the moves. I think this fear is one of the biggest things holding me back. 

I've been trying to just get more and more exposure to it, climb up to the bolt instead of high-clipping when possible, but I'm still struggling to find a way to get past the fear.

Anyone have any suggestions with this?

Edit: to clarify, it's not the falling in and of itself that makes me scared. This is typically only when I've got slack in my hand. I do fear falling but it's more fearing the failure associated with that. Falling itself is cool so long as I don't get hurt. 
Thanks for the advice so far!
How old were you when you started climbing and what grade do you climb now? Just curious. Honestly not looking for excuses or anything, just motivation.

Feel free to drop how long you've been climbing for or any other stats you think are worthwhile.
How to tryhard outside? Mental game is weak with topouts and falling When I boulder in the gym, I can go hard and not worry about falling injuries. My gym has good crashpads and I throw myself hard at climbs.

Recently, I've been outdoors twice and my experience hasn't been amazing tbh. I really don't trust myself with topping out on anything that doesn't have a jug to pull myself up. Also, I feel like if I go hard and get spit out, the crashpad may not work as well as the gym crashpads. Injuries scare the shit out of me and I am struggling to get in a good mental state for overcoming a fear of falling and hurting myself.

How did you guys get over your mental struggles when climbing outdoors? Especially on sketchy/slopey topouts. I want to enjoy it and go out with my friends, but I honestly prefer gym climbing at this point. 

Thanks for the tips yall
A Statistical Analysis of Climbing For those of who like to nerd out on statistics, here's a very interesting statistical analysis of 28 climbers climbers:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/climbing-statistical-analysis/](https://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/climbing-statistical-analysis/)

&amp;#x200B;

It tries answer some interesting climbing questions, like how bouldering grades compare to top-rope grades, how much harder leading is than top-roping, and what different "climber types" there are
Isometric training review Took a screen shot of this on @C4HP instagram the other day, I believe it's a large review of isometric training on sport specific movements, and this is some very concise summary. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note: TUT = time under tension (hanging time)

&amp;#x200B;

If we applied this to a max hangboard session, you'd want to hang 80-100% max load, for 1-5s, for a total of 30-90s of TUT… I know most people, including myself, target 7-10s max hangs, might try switching to 5s hangs to really up the adaptation. Anyone make this switch recently?? 

&amp;#x200B;

I saw a post on here recently about whether we should target hypertrophy during hangboarding, or maybe just whether hangboarding causes hypertrophy… either way the screen shot here concludes you should hang 70-75% of max, with sustained contractions of 3-30s per rep, and a total of 80-150s of TUT per session. It also notes you should train this for &gt; 36 sessions, which would be about 2.5 months if you did this every other day (seems like A LOT!). 

&amp;#x200B;

If we applied this to a "repeaters" hangboard protocol, you could do 7on:3off repeaters x6 per set, and complete up to 4 sets of that for a total TUT of 168s. Seems to be in line with a typical repeaters session? 

&amp;#x200B;

Couple questions I want to throw out there:

	\- Do we want to target hypertrophy by hangboarding? Or is it just a byproduct. 

	\- Anyone make the shift to 1-5s max hangs and what impact did it have? 

	\- **Big question that I'm confused on also, do you want to go to failure when doing repeater/endurance/hypertrophy (whatever you want to call it) work?**

An Overview of Coaching: Common Questions This post is my attempt to summarize questions which crop up from time to time. These range from anything related to needing a coach, understanding what the role of a coach is, and evaluating whether or not a coach is 'good'.

Let's dive right in!

##**What does it mean to be a good coach?**

There are two types of good:

1. Objectively good
2. Subjectively good

Objectively good traits are ones which are beneficial for a coach to have regardless of who's being coached, whereas subjectively good traits are ones which are beneficial for a coach to have for some people, but not for everyone. Please keep in mind that where a particular trait falls is my opinion, and thus I'm not using "objective" to imply truth.

For example, an objectively good trait for a coach would be a constant willingness to keep up-to-date on contemporary training methods within the context of climbing, whereas a subjectively good trait would be a focus on developing competent lead climbers.

Therefore, a 'good' coach is one who has objectively good traits, whereas a 'good coach for you' is one who has those objective traits but also the right subjectively good ones. This implies that you and your prospective coach must be able to communicate effectively with one another to see if the coach has the right traits for you. But how can you tell which traits are good?

##**Goals**

###What is a goal?

Let's look at a vignette:

*Cassandra picked up climbing just over two years ago when she visited a local bouldering gym with a group of friends. Since then, she's been climbing 3-4 times per week, but has done no structured training. She's ventured outside a few times, but found the grading to be a huge detractor from the experience. Indoors, she can consistently boulder all V4s and most V5s, but has never tried V6 or harder. Though she rarely gets on top rope, she's able to comfortably climb anything below 5.11, but her gym only sets harder than 5.11 on lead, which she doesn't feel ready for.*

*Recognizing her mental blocks, she decides to meet with a coach to help her. She tells her coach that her current goal is to break into indoor V6 (and maybe V7!), and to lead 5.11b. One year from now, she wants to be confidently climbing outdoors twice a week, whether it be bouldering or sport.*

Has Cassandra chosen appropriate goals?

An appropriate goal has to meet a few criteria:

* Specific
* Measurable
* Realistic

Are Cassandra's goals specific? &gt;!Yes!&lt;

Are Cassandra's goals measurable? &gt;!Yes!&lt;

Are Cassandra's goals realistic? &gt;!Yes!&lt;

###Specific

Keep in mind that while these states are binary (yes or no), there are varying levels of specific, measurable, and realistic.

Cassandra's goals are specific because they are providing concrete numbers to be achieved.

###Measurable

With specific numbers comes a way to quantify progression toward each goal.

###Realistic

Assuming that Cassandra lives close to bouldering and sport crags, then yes.

###Effective

Although Cassandra's goals met the requisite criteria, they were far from perfect. This low-efficacy goal-setting is common, and often serves as a template for a coach to work with.

With that said, let's try and fine-tune her goals!

##Mid-term Goal

Because Cassandra is already capable of climbing indoor V6, she could make her goal more specific by choosing a particular V6 in her style on her preferred wall angle. To improve measurability, she could attempt the problem 10 times during each session, with a 4 minute rest between attempts. Given the frequency in which the goal can see progression, whether or not it's realistic can be known relatively quickly; it's simply a matter of choosing the correct climb.

Since the lead climbing is primarily a mental block, Cassandra should start to take a specific number of lead falls per rope session. Half of this number should be intentional falls, and the other half should be unintentional. Grades shouldn't be part of her goal yet, since she hasn't established her actual lead climbing level.

##Long-term Goal

Cassandra's long-term goal is sparse on the specificity. Though she has a specific number of days, she doesn't have a specific style of climbing to fill these days, nor has she mentioned a specific difficulty. She should commit to once per week for each discipline.

Confidence can't really be measured exactly, in the sense that its level can't be quantified. However, relative levels can be established. Cassandra can measure progress by recording herself on easier problems and routes throughout the year to see if signs of lack of confidence are starting to vanish.

It seems likely that Cassandra can improve her confidence outdoors and climb outside twice per week, split into one bouldering and one sport climbing session. This is subject to change if she experiences an injury due to an outdoor fall, or a similar situation.

##In Summary

The right subjectively good traits for a coach to have are those which best support you in meeting your goals.

#Possible subjectively good traits

Think of these as primarily the application of general knowledge to a specific context, as well as having specific knowledge related to a particular context.

For example, a general practitioner will refer you to a specialist in some medical field depending on what your issues present themselves as. That specialist will have a greater theoretical and empirical knowledge of the scope of their field, and thus will be able to have a better understanding of the underlying issue. This relies on applying general principles to the context of their field for the purposes of achieving a pre-defined goal (getting you better), as well as knowledge specific to that context.

Coaches operate much the same way. Climbing is highly varied in its disciplines and goals within each one that, at the highest level of coaching, specialization is required. Generally, the degree of specialization needed increases as your level of climbing increases, though this isn't always the case.

Returning to the vignette of Cassandra, what might some subjectively good traits in a coach be for her?

* Able to provide ways of handling stress mid-route
* Familiarity with climbers who suffer from lack of confidence
* Experience with climbers at or around her level
* Previous lead climbing experience, both indoors and outdoors

As the amount of provided context increases, so too do the number of subjectively good traits which can be thought of as ideal. While the coach doesn't need to have *all* the traits, they should at least have the traits which make themselves known even with minimal context, as in the four above. Often, these 'core' traits manifest themselves repeatedly as more context is explored, as they're often reflective of your general thought processes. In Cassandra's case, it wouldn't be a surprise to see lack of confidence as pervasive throughout many aspects of her climbing, and into her daily life.

#What is the role of a coach?

Ultimately, a coach's role is to help you achieve your short-, mid-, and long-term goals using appropriate methods.

##Appropriate Methods

These are methods which respect the following paradigms:

* Safe
* Evidence-based
* Conservative
* Useful
* Individualized
* Communicable
* Structured

###Safe

Injuries are the biggest setbacks to a climbing career. Many climbers quit due to injury, and being injured is never conducive toward achieving goals.

Also, there are certain instances where methods used absolutely need to be as safe as possible. When coaching youth climbers, for example, it's critical for a coach to be aware of growth plates and the disastrous effects that can happen to a youth if injury to one occurs. This type of injury will carry a lifelong impact.

###Evidence-based

This doesn't necessarily mean that the method needs research consensus for validity. Climbing is a young sport, particularly in the research department, but if there are publications discussing a particular method, then a coach should be aware of this and respect the findings.

Anecdotal evidence is fine, as long as it doesn't run contrary to research consensus. A coach should make sure to explain to you when they're providing anecdote versus citing research.

###Conservative

Closely related to safe, this paradigm is different in that while a method may be safe, it is possible to use the method too liberally, thus making it run the risk of causing injury. Therefore, a conservative approach to assignment of methods is important to helping you achieve your goals.

###Useful

Some methods may not be dangerous, but simply don't contribute toward your goals. Therefore, methods should be useful to avoid wasting time and energy.

###Individualized

Run away from any coach who uses cookie-cutter training plans. **This person is not a coach, but a bad trainer**. Any method used absolutely needs to be tailored to your specific needs, whether they be modification to accommodate for previous injury, a general health concern, or to meet any of the other paradigms.

###Communicable

If a coach can't provide adequate communication of everything a method entails (proper form, rest time, when to use it, etc.), then the method shouldn't be used. This lack of ability to communicate runs the risk of undermining the other paradigms.

###Structured

There needs to be some structure within a plan; otherwise, it's not actually a plan at all! Each method should be highly structured, while the overall plan can range from low (use x number of y methods z times per week) to high, depending on your needs.

If a coach isn't able to use methods which respect **every paradigm**, then a domino effect is likely and you're running the risk of injury, which is the antithesis of goal achievement.

Note: almost everyone gets injured at some point in a climbing career. Ultimately, it's impossible for methods to ensure no injury will occur. The point is to reduce the likelihood of injury as much as possible, which is also going to rely on your ability to recognize signs of being close to injury.

Further, some methods inherently carry a higher risk of injury than others (think training coordination moves for competition climbing!). Climbers training for higher-risk endeavors need to accept this risk and not place blame on the coach without due cause. Injury doesn't always imply poor coaching.

This leads to the next topic:

#Do you need a coach?

Or, perhaps easier to answer: are you ready for a coach?

Some people are easier to coach than others, whereas some are, for all intents and purposes, practically uncoachable. This could be for any number of reasons, such as cognitive ability, unwillingness to be vulnerable, a personality disorder (such as Narcissistic Personality Disorder) which doesn't allow for the coaching-student dynamic to manifest, or simply a lack of desire to listen to someone else's advice, regardless of validity.

Most people can benefit greatly from a coach with the right subjectively good traits. This theoretical ideal (having access to such a coach) is unfortunately not as common as it should be, and can also be made impossible due to factors outside of your control, such as financial constraints.

##Remote Coaching

I don't believe that remote coaching is possible unless there's previous in-person coaching time. Assessment of movement patterns and mentality are strongly hampered when live, in-person feedback isn't possible. For some things like strength assessment, remote evaluation can be helpful, and often cheaper, but remote coaching has too many limitations for it to ever be feasible for covering all that coaching entails, though it can be helpful to assess quantifiable factors and providing a general exercise plan for energy system work.

##Being Your own Coach

With many respects, you can be your own coach. However, even coaches will benefit from having a coach! Outside feedback from a knowledgeable source helps to eliminate bias and can keep you honest or motivated to share your successes with them.

##Coaching Frequency

Generally, frequency of coaching sessions tapers as more context is understood. Long-term coaching prospects (for a 1-on-1 setting) rely on a 'checking in' system, whereby progress is monitored and the plan is altered to reflect small changes in context, thus preventing the plan from being increasingly skewed as time passes. In the short-term, sessions could range anywhere from 2-3 sessions per week to a session a month. Remote communication is increasingly viable as more context is understood, and can be used effectively to make small changes to short- or mid-term goals.

#Laconic Explanation

A coach's role is to help you achieve your goals using appropriate methods. You can most likely benefit from a good coach in the long-term regardless of your level and knowledge base.

I'd love to hear your thoughts, opinions, ideas, and overall feedback! I hope you found this helpful.
Yesterday I decked from about 30 feet up at the gym Was doing some lead with a relatively new partner. I pumped out and came off near the last bolt and ended up on the floor. Needless to say my belayer wasn’t paying attention and I was pretty pissed. Miraculously I’m not injured. I’m just not sure where to go from here. I’ve been feeling like I’ve been getting more comfortable on lead and taking falls but this threw me for a loop I don’t even know what to expect psychologically next time I climb in the gym let alone on lead outdoors. Any dialogue about this would be appreciated.
Beastmaker 1000 and 2000 edge/hold sizes This is a compilation of information available online about the edge/hold size of the two Beastmakers fingerboards *(1000 &amp; 2000)*

I've measured the 1000 with a simple ruler and will do the same with the 2000 next time I'm at the gym, but if someone has 15minutes to spare and wants to have a go at it, just reply to this and I'll update the table with proper credit.

I'm posting this for my own future reference as I've got *bored* of searching online every time I was curious about an edge size and finding no information *(for the 2000)* or conflicting. If this doesn't merit a post, then mods can just delete it and I'll post again in a weekly hangout or simple questions thread.

Measurements are in millimeters *(mm)*. The slopper angle is 35º.

perfect mental state/ power of now Ever experienced the 110% focus on a hard climb where you are only concerned about making the next move and nothing else? not the pump, or the climb up to this point, the crux in the upper section or the top out. Before you realise it, the climb is done. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are your tricks in getting to these perfect mental states?
What does it mean exactly to be "too strong for your fingers" or is this even a thing? I've come across some anecdotal experiences in this sub about being mindful of being "too strong for your fingers". What does this mean exactly? Does this mean that newbie climbers who have a gymnastics or weighted pull up background have a higher risk of injury because of an imbalanced kinetic chain? Is this a legit phenomenon to be worried about? I mean we're all aware of the typical strong climber who muscles his way through boulders without focusing on graceful movement. The "i've been climbing for 3 months and can you give me tips on how to break a v5 plateau" peeps. I mean you'd never recommend "do more pull-ups" in this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize in the context of "strength vs technique" that people should focus more on technique and climbing volume when faced with a newbie-gains-plateau. Beginners are usually strong enough to send stuff they think they're too weak enough to climb however **would you go as far as to** **keep beginners from doing weighted pull ups early in their climbing careers?**

&amp;#x200B;

Conversely, **what's a good indicator of knowing you have weak pulling strength and need to work on it more?** 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a short climber and don't really train pulling strength that much but that's because I could do 10 straight pullups even before I started climbing. I know I'll need to have stronger lock-off strength eventually but I've made it a point to not train pull-ups at all since I started climbing. I guess I just want to be more efficient with my training time and if I don't need to train pull-ups, that time is better spent doing other things like antagonist work and core.
Pushing past the V4-5 Plateau I started climbing Jan of 2018. I've been pretty consistent about my climbing since then, especially in the last year. 

HOWEVER, I seem to have plateaued at the V4-5 grade and have been stuck for a while (about a year). I've been incorporating some hangboarding and pinch block training into my gym regiment, but I was wondering if anyone has had a similar issue.

If you have anything even remotely helpful to say, 
PLEASE COMMENT. ANYTHING HELPS.

Climb on.
Recommended Climbing Apps To Track Progress And Climb Harder? Hi Everyone,

I've (M, mid-twenties, 190lbs, 5'-7") been climbing for a year and a half now and am plateauing in the V4/V5 range. Up to this point, all I've been doing is going to the gym and climbing, and haven't really taken training seriously yet. But now is a time that I do want to start making progress in my climbing. The place I think I should start is to keep track of my climbs (ie. grades, type of problem, etc...) in order to see which areas I need to train and improve. 

Are there any climbing apps out there that you would recommend for me to do this? Or are there any other advice you could give to help me improve my climbing?
Training finger cracks - strengthening fingers Over the weekend I had my ass kicked on a climb with a finger crack crux. We dont get many crack climbs where I stay so its not something I get to train very often. 

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any ways to train finger cracks away from the rock? Does finger boarding translate?
Weight loss/climbing training plan TLDR: I need help making a workout/training plan that focuses on multipitch climbing and losing weight. I only have 4 days a week to train and climb. I would like to keep 2 days to an hour ish time frame and 2 days could be closer to 3. 

Hey guys! I’m trying to put together a training plan and I was looking for some ideas/guidance.  Currently I top rope 5.11, lead 5.10 inside and 5.9 outside, and boulder v-2.  I haven’t projected in a long time and my climbing has been very inconsistent for the past couple of years. These are what I go into the gym (or outside) and either flash or do with a couple of falls.  I’m 6’3 275lbs, my BMI is about 33 and my body fat % is about 28%.  I’m starting back to school soon and will be changing careers and with this new restart I would also like to get back in shape, lose a lot of weight and climb really fucking hard.  

My goals: 

1. 230lbs. I’m a pretty big, muscular guy but there is definitely a lot of fat to lose. I think this is what holds me back the most in climbing. It’s a LOT of weight to haul up the wall but it’s also scary as fuck to take a lead fall when you’re at least a hundred lbs more than your belayer. 

2.  I love trad climbing! I want to do lots of multipitch trad and climb mountains with technical trad sections involved. I want to be comfortable leading 5.9 trad and following 5.10. That should give me tons of options across the country. 

3. I’m significantly less concerned with sport and bouldering but I would like to lead 5.11 outside and boulder v5-6. I rarely boulder and probably won’t ever do it outside, but I do understand it’s value and I am willing to boulder as a means of getting stronger for outside trad/sport climbing. 

My limitations:  

I work a full time job. I work 3 12 hour shifts on Tuesday/Thursday/Friday.   I’m starting school and will have classes on Monday and most of the day on Wednesday. 

So I’ll have 4 days a week to work out and climb. It’s easy to find a work out program for four days a week and it’s easy to find a climbing program for four days a week, but I’m not sure how to mix them together for the best results. I think clearly, losing 40 or 50 lbs will improve my climbing the most. But I don’t want to not climb while I get there.  So how should I split my time with at least one climbing day but preferably two?  

Also, I understand that diet is the best way to lose weight. I have the knowledge I need to eat better, I just need the motivation to follow the plan I have laid out. I’m looking more for the climbing/running/weight lifting side of things here. Thanks for all your suggestions and ideas.
Confession of a "buff" climber looking for advice. You've probably seen me around at your local gym. I'm the climber that looks really strong to a regular person but is actually relatively weak when it comes to climbing. I recently became a personal trainer and worked hard to get buff and strong at a regular gym for 4 years now. I feel like my strength was an advantage and still occasionally is but also has turned into a disadvantage. I used to always cut my feet, and I have ALWAYS overcompensated with my muscles to avoid actually getting better at technique and finger strength. 

A year ago I started to develop synovitis in my middle finger, middle joint. I've gotten relatively okay at managing it and I'm always trying new things to make it better. But at the end of the day, it's also making me avoid crimping, or trying to hangboard to improve grip because I'm scared of worsening it. 

I think I could probably guess the advice I'm going to get, but I still want it anyways. Also, if there are any videos of people talking about the subject etc., those are also helpful.

For reference, I'm mostly a v4/v5 climber and have done 10 v6's over the past year but none of them were hard 6's. Based on watching other climbers, my arm strength is probably good enough for a v9/v10 climber.
Keeping good footwork when climbing at limits? I feel as though I have good footwork at lower levels. I have trained and make an effort to place my feet carefully and what I think is optimally. However when trying to climb at my limit, I find that my footwork rapidly declines. Despite always practicing quiet feet (at lower grades) any suggestions for having good footwork when desperation sets in?
Lifting + hangboard + bouldering = good routine? I just got back into bouldering after a year of only lifting weights. During that year I've become a lot stronger and leaner, which directly showed in my bouldering strength. I think most of this is due to my weight loss, improved core strength and higher pullup repetitions.

Now that I found new motivitation, I want to continue lifting. I can only visit the climbing gym once a week. Also I want to improve finger and grip strength, so I bought a finger board for my home. I came up with a routine that incorporates all of these: lifting twice a week, hangboarding + dumbbell/core training at home twice a week, bouldering once a week.

My lifting program looks like this (and is based on [this](https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/2-times-a-week-for-twice-the-gains)):

Day 1:

* Bench press: 10x50% of 10RM, 10x60% of 10RM, 10x70% of 10RM, 10x100% of 10RM (AMRAP)
* Deadlift: 5x50% of 2RM, 3x75% of 2RM, 2x100% of 2RM
* OHP: 10x50% of 10RM, 5x75% of 10RM, 10x100% of 10RM (AMRAP)
* Lat Pulldowns: 10x50% of 10RM, 5x75% of 10RM, 10x100% of 10RM (AMRAP)
* Facepulls: 10x50% of 10RM, 5x75% of 10RM, 10x100% of 10RM (AMRAP)

Day 2:

* bench press: 10x50% of 10RM, 10x60% of 10RM, 10x70% of 10RM, 10x100% of 10RM (AMRAP)
* Squat: 10x50% of 10RM, 10x75% of 10RM, 10x100% of 10RM, 20x empty bar (AMRAP)
* Calf Raises: 10x50% of 10RM, 5x75% of 10RM, 10x100% of 10RM (AMRAP)
* Leg Curls: 10x50% of 10RM, 5x75% of 10RM, 10x100% of 10RM (AMRAP)
* Cable Crunches: 10x50% of 10RM, 5x75% of 10RM, 10x100% of 10RM (AMRAP)

Hangboard day (2x/wk):

* 10 sec hang, 20 sec rest x 6 (=one set)
* Do 4 sets
* Dumbbell bicep curls: 4x10x10kg
* Lateral Raises: 4x10x10kg
* Ab Rollouts: 4x10
* Planks: 2x2min

What do you think? Does this make sense as a program? Would I be able to progress beyond my all time high level of climbing 6B's that dates back to 10 years ago?
Arthritis gloves for synovitis? A study and my questions I read [a study about the effectiveness of 2 different brands of arthritis gloves on synovitis symptoms](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/art.1790050407&amp;ved=2ahUKEwijkJ6qz9jjAhXLh1QKHf19CxcQFjAAegQIARAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1aacuZwF1JQaK1qUCgu2iI). Both gloves were found to reduce symptoms and improve ROM and grip strength. Has anybody heard of climbers using them for synovitis? I have synovitis and have been working on it for quite a long time now. It feels like my symptoms always worsen quite a bit when I sleep at night so I hypothesize that wearing these would help. Warm water always seems to improve my ROM and lessen symptoms and compression is scientifically pretty useful. 

I was wondering if people knew climbers that used them and if it helped, and what brands or specific gloves would be best.

Edit: if link doesn't work, type in "Randomized, Controlled Trial of 
Compression Gloves in Rheumatoid Arthritis" in Google for the study
Hangboard/climbing schedule Hi everyone,

Looking to start hangboarding soon (coming up on my 2 year climbaversary!) and I was hoping for some help with programming. All the guides I’ve found online recommend doing 1-2 hangboard sessions a week with rest in between, I was wondering how people here work hangboarding into their climbing schedule. Or do you just take time off from climbing when you’re in a hangboard cycle and just hangboard? Put hangboarding at the end of a climbing session? I’m lost.
Couldn’t climb for 2 months and improved by 1 grade when I started climbing again. Here’s what I did. I had to stop climbing early May because my gym was closed for the summer (university gym), and I no longer had transportation to the city gym. When I stopped climbing, I had climbed one V3-V4 at the city gym. I started climbing again last week at a different gym (same company as the city gym, but harder according to my friends who can climb V10s), and I’ve climbed three V4-V5s there so far.

For two months, I basically did this routine 5 days a week (I took a day off here and there and probably averaged closer to 4 days a week):

Warmup (3-5 min light cardio, dynamic stretching, 5-10 easy pushup/dip variation, 5 pullups, 5-10s one-arm dead hangs, 5-10 easy squat variation)

Superset 1:

* 3x3 one-arm pullup progression
* 2x5-8 handstand pushup progression followed by 2x5-8 leg progression

Superset 2:

* 2x5-8 row progression
* 2x5-8 dip progression

Superset 3:

* 2x10s front lever progression
* 2x10s planche progression

Finger training:

* 2x10s no hang (20mm edge, half-crimp)
* 2x10s no hang (20mm edge, three finger drag)

Twice a week I also added the following accessories after superset 3:

* 3x8-12 ring flyes
* 3x8-12 ring rollouts
* 3x8-12 reverse wrist curls

And twice a week I added these accessories instead after superset 3:

* 3x8–12 hanging leg raises
* one max set of wide grip pullups

For the supersets, I would do a set of the first exercise, rest 90 seconds, then do a set of the second exercise and rest another 90 seconds before going back to the first exercise. This way I got 3 minutes of rest between sets of the same exercise, but reduced how long each workout took by sharing rest tine between exercises.

For the no hangs, I rested 3 minutes between sets, and I did not alternate between the two types of grips.

For the accessories, I rested 90 seconds between sets and did not alternate between exercises.

The reason I trained 5x a week is because I had a lot of free time and because [high frequency training leads to improved strength gains even when weekly volume is controlled for](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/training-frequency/). One concern with high frequency training is inadequate recovery, but I found that because the daily volume was pretty low (2 sets in which you don’t go failure on either set rather than 3-5 sets where you may go to failure on the last set), I would basically feel fresh the day after a workout. The two rest days each week (plus an extra rest day here and there) took care of anything that lingered.

The studies that show that high frequency training leads to improved strength gains for muscles don’t include fingers/tendons, so I was extrapolating  there, but the high frequency method worked for me.

The reason I did all bodyweight stuff was because I think calisthenics is more fun than traditional weights.

To cut down on how long this routine takes, I would convert it to a 3x a week routine by changing all sets from 2 to 3 (3x3 pullups would become 3x5 pullups) and I’d cut out planche progression and make the HSPU progression part of the superset containing the front lever progression.

Here is my progressions on the various exercises over the last two months:

* One-arm pullup progression (right arm): not able to pull myself up at all with my right arm (I could dead hang with just my right arm though) -&gt; pullup until elbow is a bit less than 90 degrees (eyes at level of bar)
* one arm pullup progression (left arm): 3x3 assisted one arm pullups with assisting arm halfway between wrist and elbow -&gt; 3x3 assisted one arm pullups with assisting arm at elbow level
* 2x8 parallel bar dips (elbow at 90 degrees) -&gt; 2x8 ring dips (as far as shoulders are able to go down)
* 3x5-8 assisted pistol squats -&gt; 3x4 pistol squats w/ 45 lb plate
* 2x10s tuck front lever -&gt; 2x15s single leg front lever
* 2x10s no hang, 20mm edge, half crimp: 65 lbs for left arm, 80 lbs for right arm -&gt; 80 lbs for left arm, 92.5 lbs for right arm
* 3x8-12 ring flyes on knees, body still almost vertical with arms stretched out, arms quite bent -&gt; 3x8-12 ring flyes on feet, body forms 45 degree angle with ground with arms stretched out, arms 95% straight

I also lost 5 lbs over the last two months.

tl:dr Did a bodyweight strength straining routine and no hangs 4-5x a week for two months

Edit: I’ve done nine V4-V5 and one V6-V7 as of 08/17/19. I went back to the city gym I had done one V3-V4 at recently and I was able to do four V3-V4 in a single session.
Trying hard is hard. I'm sadly quite bad at really pushing myself. I tend to let go of the bar when I could probably push out one last pullup, or fall off the hangboard when I could probably hang on for just a few more seconds.

This is obviously an even larger problem when it comes to climbing, as trying really hard might be the difference between sticking the crux or falling off. 

Following a program in order to climb harder is great, but I feel like I'm really wasting my potential by not even climbing hard in the first place.

What can I do to change this? What has worked for you? How do you go from giving it 80-85% to 95-100%?



I'll put some things here I **don't** think is the reason for my problem, just to provide some more information.

It's not like I rationalize reasons for why letting go seems like a good idea, I just don't push myself. The people I climb with are in the same situation as I am, so they're not the greatest help.

I'm also not that scared of injuring myself. I've never had an issue that took longer than a few weeks to fix, so I still have some illusion of invincibility. 

My total climbing age is 2.5 years, but with a long break after the first year. 

Never climbed outside, sending V4s somewhat consistently (I think, my gym uses colours as grades).  I've also sent two V4s on the moonboard, no benchmarks though.
Most useful on the wall drills? What are your favourite training drills that you feel are the most useful for improving your climbing? 

Right now the only thing I do are 4x4s on easy routes at the start of my sessions but am wondering what drills I can do to improve my technique. Thanks!
Show your DIY contraptions Have you built (or even better, just kinda hacked together) some kind of training apparatus? What did you make and what's it for? 

I'll start. Here's my no-hang "pinch plate" that's a few sheets of .25" plywood tied together. It's for training a range of  different pinch sizes.

I took a crack at building an all-in-one training app. Introducing Gneiss! **TL;DR:** I built an app that I think you guys might like. It's out now on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gneiss/id1448070631) (and the Android version is in the works).

Hey all,

About a year ago, I hit a pretty major plateau in my climbing and decided it was time to start taking training seriously. Like any good millennial, my first stop was the App Store. I figured there had to be some type of climbing app with tools to create, schedule, and track my training. I was shocked to find that that app didn't exist, so I made the questionable decision to develop it myself. It turned into a way bigger and more involved project than I ever could have imagined, but the first version is finally ready and just went live in the App Store!

The philosophy behind Gneiss is to replace your notebook, calendar, and various training apps with a single intuitive application. Without getting too wordy, here are some of the highlights:

* Purpose-built interfaces for climbing, hangboard, campus, and strength training
* Automatic logging of training sessions. Just completing the workout saves all the information Gneiss needs to provide lots of useful, visual feedback!
* Calendar-based scheduling that makes creating and sticking to a training plan super easy.
* Exercise reminder notifications (if you want)
* Innovative analytics and statistics for all types of exercises
* Intelligent logbook integration. When you start a workout, your logbook entry for the previous session (including notes, statistics, and lots of other stuff) is right where you need it. This makes tracking your progress super easy...no more flipping through a notebook to figure out what weight or times you're supposed to be using!

Anyway, I don't want this to sound like a sales pitch, so I'll cut it off there! There's additional information and some screenshots on the [App Store listing](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gneiss/id1448070631) if you're interested.

The app is free to use, but subscribing to "Premium" unlocks a ton of useful features that make planning, understanding, and optimizing your training super intuitive. At $14.99/yr (or $1.99/month), Premium is cheaper than a Moleskine and a pen and WAY more useful! All new users get a 2-week free trial, so there's no pressure at all to subscribe.

I hope you guys like it. Spending hours at a desk building an app certainly wasn't the most efficient way to break through the plateau, but now that it's done I really think it's a useful tool to climb harder! Holler at me in the comments if you have any questions, issues, or feedback.

Decided to work on my stretching, here is a comparison of my toe touches after just a month! (Tried to only keep a slight bend in the knees)
Unable to attempt my project multiple times in a day. On my recent project I've been feeling like my first go of the day is my _only_ viable redpoint attempt, anyone have experience this issue before, and if so did you do any training / tactics to remedy this situation?

The climb is longer than I'm used to, being a 12c with ~33 meters of continuous climbing ranging from V2-V4; only having one good attempt a day is pretty limiting. The last couple weeks I've made it to the last bolt on my first attempt of the day, and any subsequent attempts I just feel stupid pumped and fall barely halfway into the route.

I try resting around 30-40 minutes in between attempts right now, with light activity in between to stay warm (hanging on a hangboard with feet on the ground, jumping jacks, etc). If it's also relevant, my usual climbing schedule is:

- Mon/Wed: 2H climbing, 15/20M climbing drill(4x4 or treadwall), 30M weightlifting
- Sat: Outdoor project

Do I need to climb _longer_ when I'm training to build overall climbing stamina, or is this just simply an endurance problem and I should keep working on my endurance?
Frustrated with lack of substantial progress This might just be a bit of a vent, but I've been training consistently and I hope intelligently for quite a while, yet it feels like the progress I've made is not even close to enough. Idk, here's a quick rundown of my current training benchmarks, maybe there's an obvious weakness or missing benchmark that I need to work on, current body weight is somewhere between 64-65kg:

* One arm max hangs ~ -6-7 kg for a 7-10s hang on the 1k bottom edges (using a pulley system and straight arm/ approx 120°/ approx 80° - Chris Webb Parson routine)
* Two arm max hangs ~ +34kg on the 2k bottom edges (6 hangs of 10s - lattice routine, I should probably do a testing session again soon, the last was May 4th which topped out at 40kg on a 7s hang)
* Two arm min edges ~ +10kg on the 8mm micros (6 hangs of 7s), a few seconds at bodyweight on the 6mms (lol they're painful). Haven't really made much progress on this in the last couple of months, though the +10kg hangs have become much more comfortable.
* Max pullups - Been a while since I tested this but I did 2 reps of +45kg at the end of April.
* On the minute pullups? (5 sets of 5 reps with a minute rest) - Can currently manage nearly 4 sets at +10kg, have done the full 5 sets with +5kg.
* Max campus - Can consistently do 1-5-8 left hand first, right hand is maybe 1-5-7.5. Big juggy rungs. 
* One arm pullups - Can't do them from a straight arm, a constant source of annoyance for me. I can hold a lockoff with a few extra kilos though + do a one armer from maybe 110°.
* Front levers - Can hold a full front lever for maybe 5-6s at my best. I usually train in the 1 and a half position, pushing for more like a 1.75 front lever - holding this for 20s. 1.5 levers (90° bend) I can hold for 25s, maybe more (haven't tried to extend this time, instead I made them harder i.e. 1.75 levers)
* Compression - I've been slowly but surely improving my prone T's. I'm using a chair to elevate my feet above my hands now. Form is the most important thing, so the exact difficulty is vague.
* Flexibility - Still can't do the splits perfectly but otherwise I'm hypermobile in my hips. Feet behind head etc. I doubt this is ever going to be an issue on a climb as my range of motion is usually far beyond what's necessary. My flexibility is the only thing I'm moderately happy with, though I am still trying to improve on this because it's the only thing I have any sort of talent for.

The first thing that is obviously missing is any sort of climbing, yes. I am still climbing 4 times a week, usually with an endurance focused day once a week. I haven't had much chance to get outdoors recently but I still try to work on my general technique. The highest grade I've managed to climb outdoors is 7B+ and I highly doubt I'm capable of 7C yet. In April I had a few sessions on a couple of 7C's in particular and they felt close, but since then I've moved and can't revisit them, which is probably the main issue here. The two 7B+'s I've done I could have flashed - they didn't take any working out at all, one is soft and is considered 7B now I think. Maybe the other one is too.

I know I shouldn't compare my training to others, but I can't help seeing people that have been training for less than a year smashing out one armers and hanging similar weights to me. For some context I've been climbing at least a few times a week for over 3 years, with a total of over 2000 hours logged since the start of 2016. Before that I climbed maybe two or three times a week for a year, with a further 4 years of inconsistent climbing, once a week at best.

I'm sure this is just a normal rant, but I can't help but feel that I'm somehow missing a genetic trait for strength or something. How the fuck are people getting past 7B/+??? It seems like everytime I climb something that feels like the next level, jokes on me it's a 7B+. Everytime I'm feeling strong and pushing my limits, jokes on me I'm still not strong enough for 7C. It's depressing as fuck. Sure I try not to get caught up in grades but I'm not training for the sake of training, I want results at some point. Yet here I am bashing my head against 7B+. Maybe I just need to suck it up and keep at it, but fuck it really sucks at times.

Tl;dr - Weak/shit climber is annoyed at how hard climbing is. Wrote a bitchy post to complain to reddit. Will probably get a grip and keep climbing.
Has ANYBODY actually ever gotten rid of synovitis and their puffy joints? I have had synovitis for a year. I've been working on it for a long time and have tried many many different things. I saw a somewhat helpful, somewhat not physical therapist. Not gonna speak too much more on what I do but has anybody actually gotten rid of theirs? 

I have not seen a single post about somebody recovering from synovitis and it doesn't come back after a couple months. I have messaged quite a few people who have made posts in the past on this subreddit about doing therapy for synovitis and the ones that reply say they still have it.

Edit: 

Thank you for all the responses! Feel free to keep them coming. Glad to hear at least a couple success stories in this world of darkness ): . I'm going to look into trying to change my grip from a half crimp grip to a 3-finger drag but I can't even hold that at all right now
Advice for training specifically for USA collegiate nationals? Might be a shot in the dark, but is there anyone here who has knowledge or experience on training/competing at the USA collegiate national level? I'm trying to create a training plan for myself, but find myself missing key pieces of info. I have competed at my local collegiate circuit in the advanced categories and have consistently placed first. However, I have never attended nationals.

For instance, what should I bring my approximate lead/boulder flash level up to?  If you've competed, how did you structure your training? Any tips or things that surprised you about the comp? All input is welcome, just trying to get more ideas.
shoulder exercises for better gaston/lock off? one of my weakness are moves where you have to lock off or gaston with shoulders. example are moves where distance between 2 holds are too far for static so you have to hit it slightly dynamic and use shoulders to stabilize. 

im not sure what type of extra shoulder exercises i can do to strengthen it, any advice?
Cutting out deadwood Curious to hear about what aspects of supplemental training peeps have cut out over the years. I've been climbing a relatively long time and some of the advice given to me in the gym or that Ive read in books over the years has sometimes proven to be fairly poor. For me I realized as I progressed as a climber that all of these things needed to go:

* **High volume, multi-grip hangboard routines**. The Rock Climbers Training Manual was a great advance on Eric Horst's book at the time (2014), but I think they got this wrong. Half-crimp all the way baby. Thanks to Eva Lopez for sorting this out.
* **Static stretching during warmup**. Still see people doing this. Old habits die hard.
* **Offset deadhangs**. Got this idea with my first metolius hangboard, not great. [They still give the same advice](https://www.metoliusclimbing.com/training_more_exercises.html)!
* **Frenchies**. Ok this one might be controversial. Maybe its more of a sport climber thing. IMO there are much better ways to gain lockoff strength.
* **Endurance and non-climbing specific core exercises**. No more 2 minute planks or windshield wipers...
* **High rep supplemental training in general**. Strength is king for both agonists and antagonists.
* **Icing for medium/long-term injury recovery** (e.g. pulleys). This idea has kicked the bucket.
* **Non-climbing specific and passive hip stretches**. No more Butterfly pose. Frog it up and combine with lift offs for mobility.
* **Cool-downs**. I think there is a place for this, but mainly when you need to relax after a high-intensity session to get better sleep. But as a general thing to do, I don't see much benefit.
* **"Hanging off your bones"** (ok this is technique not training but it also relates to hangboarding). I don't know if anyone else has received this advice, but it's obviously bad. Learning to activate my upper back stabilizers to move in and out of straight-arm positions has been enormously useful for me and I feel like it's a core skill all climbers need to learn at a fairly early stage.

What have you guys got to add to this list?
Received the Beastmaker 2000 as a gift- Help! Hi guys!

My amazing boyfriend got me the beastmaker 2000 hangboard as an anniversary gift ([https://www.mec.ca/en/product/6001-791/Beastmaker-2000-Hangboard?colour=WDG04&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwv8nqBRDGARIsAHfR9wD9frF8IrN5WWRWzZnOGXlYhwxarcGOqT426u3ydfkwK4ecZ4FiV4QaAlipEALw\_wcB](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/6001-791/Beastmaker-2000-Hangboard?colour=WDG04&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwv8nqBRDGARIsAHfR9wD9frF8IrN5WWRWzZnOGXlYhwxarcGOqT426u3ydfkwK4ecZ4FiV4QaAlipEALw_wcB)). Now, I read the reviews online that it is an amazing hangboard and he was told in store that its the best one he can get, however I also read that it is for experienced climbers with hangboard experience and I am definitely not an experienced climber and I have no hangboarding experience haha. I really want to make this work still, even if it means once a week light training sessions and progressing super slowly since it is such an advanced and technical board. Does anyone have any advice on where I should look for beastmaker 2000 specific workouts or how I can gear this hangboard somehow towards a beginner routine?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: was suggested to give a background on how much I climb (which makes perfect sense and I feel really stupid that I didn't include it originally): Climbing on and off now for 2 years, the 'on' periods being 3-4x a week and the 'off' periods going 4-5 months without climbing due to school. I am getting back into climbing after my last consistent climbing period being around March. i'm currently working on V3s and 10-/10+s (as in, I have sent these grades in the past but do not consistently send them). I have not had much outdoor experience due to my school/ work situation since I started, but this year i'm going to have more opportunities to climb both indoors and outdoors (next spring/ summer that is) because of moving to another city. Again, I know I am not a 'hard' or even a seasoned climber, i'm basically still a novice. But it is a wonderful gift and I want to make some good use of it, even if it means like once a week, short training sessions while maintaining a consistent climbing schedule before I even consider moving up on the handboard
Does anyone have the full photo of Christian Core's ape index wall? Or a place where I can find ape indexes of pro climbers? Like this, but in better focus:
How to Write a Climbing/Training Plan Feedback Post Hi all,

I've been seeing a lot of Critique/Feedback posts (which is great!), but many of the posts are wanting in some aspects. So in order to help us help you, I created a pseudo-guide for posting such a thread. Address these bullet points and your post should cover most of the bases...

# General Guidelines

The more information you provide, the better. Think of it along the lines of "others will match how much effort you put in to help you". That doesn't mean you have to post your life story, but at least providing some baseline metrics, history; information goes a long way.

No statements that start with "I feel...". Generally, these statements provide personal assertions from you, the poster, without any background information to back it up. "I feel like I am good at hip engagement" means nothing when there is no video or concrete evidence to support your statement. Similarly, the prefix of "I think..." sort of falls into that boat, but do with it what you will.

Is it really a plateau? Many people here have plateaued for months, maybe even years. Your progress slowing down from 1 letter grade a week to 1 letter grade a month is not a plateau.

# Current Statistics/Metrics

This involves any parametric statistics with regards to your career. This includes but not limited to:

* Body Metrics: Height, Weight, Ape Index, Age
* Career Metrics: Years climbing, years training, Max redpoint grade, max onsight/flash grade, "typical" session grade, etc.
* Strength metrics: Hangboard numbers, Lifting numbers, Campus numbers, Mobility/Flexibility metrics
* Climbing Frequency
* Training Availability: Both time AND emotional/personal investment allotted
* Training History/Current training protocol

# Goals

You NEED to have a goal. It doesn't have to be ultra-specific like some people on here, but it can't just be "I want to climb V10". We all start with a broad goal like that, and narrow it down from there. An example of this could be "I want to climb Diaphanous Sea at Hueco Tanks". If you frame your goal with some level of specificity, suddenly that goal becomes more tangible and will likely have concrete steps.

Some points to consider when narrowing down your goals:

1. Indoor vs. Outdoor
2. Route vs. Boulder
3. Flash vs. Redpoint
4. Style of Climbing
5. Specific Area (Bishop vs. Hueco vs. Squamish)
6. Specific Climbs

# Additional Information

* Video feedback
* Particular Constraints of your setup (Does your gym not have a hangboard, etc.)

# Example Training Feedback Post Bad vs Good:

# BAD

Hi guys,

I wanted to get better at climbing after having done so for X months. I feel like I am good at technique. I've plateaued at 6B/V4 for 2 weeks with no visible improvement. How do I get better?

# GOOD

Hi guys,

I wanted to get better at climbing after having done so for X months (some intro so you don't sound like a bot). I currently climb about 40-60% of the 6B/V4s in the gym in less than 10 attempts. However, I have not done any 6C/V5s and above, as they just look impossible, and I usually can't do more than one or two moves on them. I can comfortably do most 6B/V4s on slab and vertical, but usually have troubles with that grade on overhung problems. My primarily goal is to get better at bouldering indoors, and want to tick off a couple 7A/V6 overhung problems by the end of the year.

I have troubles with footwork when the angle of the wall gets steep: I end up cutting feet because I can't keep my feet on, and if I'm not on jugs, I usually can't stay on if my feet come off. Similarly, on slightly less overhung routes, I have difficulties moving off of flat crimps.

I am Y years old, Z height, and have ape index of +22. I have a non-athletic background, and as such have never lifted or done physical training. However, I am fairly flexible in that I can do the splits, pigeon, etc.

In order to address these issues, I am planning on incorporating core twice a week at the end of my session. This will involve a circuit of L-sit pull ups, ab-wheel roll outs, and push ups.

Here are a few videos that I put up for critique:

[LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

As you can see here my footwork is somewhat unsure, so I wobble my feet a lot, but I retain good hip mobility to go through moves.

[LINK2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiQunMgbYAo)

From this one my main takeaway was that I am unable to use my lower body to generate power. I had to do a lot of moves with just upper body strength, which I definitely am lacking in.
TraingBeta Article: The "Simplest" Finger Training Program [https://www.trainingbeta.com/the-simplest-finger-training-program/](https://www.trainingbeta.com/the-simplest-finger-training-program/)

Alright people let's dig into this one! 

Pros:

* SIMPLICITY
* No adding weight necessary
* Do it on a portable or stationary hangboard 
* Seems like a structured/progressive way to develop muscles/tendons in a thought out manner (as opposed to just starting to do weighted hangs)
* Lays out how to do it while still training/climbing - seen A LOT of questions about this lately

Cons:

* Not easy to measure progress - max weighted hang before and after? 
* Difficult to know if you're giving the right effort level 
* Difficult to know if you're over fatiguing yourself? (because it's an effort based, not X weight on X hold for X seconds protocol) 

This article really lays out the nuances of what/when/why/how when it comes to this training protocol. I really like the development and explanation of each phase and how it leads to the next phase. The density hangs are something I used to do before I read up on hangboarding and I really think I benefited from them, and could see how they would prep you for the bread and butter "Speed Pulls" leading up to a performance phase perhaps? 

I wish C4HP would have finished the article with a little more detail about when to start this program in relation to a performance phase, and also how to do max strength maintenence during said phase. 

I'm planning to start this program doing the Density Hangs and Recruitment Pulls for 4 weeks then switch to only Recruitment Pulls and Speed Pulls as I go into my performance phase this Sept/Oct. 

Thoughts!?

Recovery during a rock trip I recently came back from a rock trip. I was shocked by how my friends were recovering so well without resting a single day fr climbing. They were climbing every day during two weeks and could send almost their highest grade (around 7a). I was climbing 7 days on a row but didn't feel so strong and I was feeling my forearms really sored. I don't drink alcohol. 
Any ideas on how can I train that? (Apart from sleeping well and eat properly) I would like to climb more routes on a day and improve my recovery between days.
Thanks in advance!
Anyone have Bechtel’s new Unstoppable Force and can clarify a question I have? So I’m laying out my training plan and just have a question about the “Worlds Simplest Hangboard session”

... in the book he lays out the hang and rest times and says to repeat it 4 times. That adds up to 5mins and 55sec of hanging and resting. Simple. 

But then at the second paragraph leading into the protocol he says “we suggest 8 repeats of this hangboard protocol”. I am now confused, haha!

So 8 repeats of the 6min protocol? That is definitely doable and adds up to a roughly 50 min session but just want to make sure I’m doing it right...
Rest Anxiety I haven’t taken an entire week off of climbing since April 2019, and before that in August 2018, both times when my wife and I went on 1-week vacations.  In fact, other than those vacations I haven’t taken more than 3 days off during that same time period.

My A4 pulleys on my ring and middle fingers on both hands have been chronically sore the past 2-3 months.  Therefore, I’ve committed to taking a solid 2 weeks off from climbing.  I will continue to hangboard on jugs/ biggest crimps to make sure my pulleys rehab correctly.

My question: I have a lot of anxiety about my performance declining if I take 2 weeks off completely from climbing.  I suspect this is mostly in my head, but I’d be interested to hear about others’ experience where they’ve taken extended time off from climbing and came out better (or worse?) on the other side.

Thanks.
Smearing on Overhangs. I've noticed this issue outside and indoors- when i'm climbing overhangs if the hold isn't a sharp edge I have trouble standing on it. I usually wear an extremely soft no edge shoe, but i've also tried stiffer edged shoes such as the solution to no avail. I know it's a technique fallacy since the shoes didn't make a difference, so i'm looking for any tips on how to position myself properly for these types of footholds. I've tried dropping the heel like on a standard vertical/slab smear but it doesn't work as well since the wall is overhanging. Should I just look for the most positive part of the foothold and treat it like a micro edge? Is there some sort of technique i'm missing?
Flexibility in climbing - How important is it? Lately I've identified flexibility as a personal weakness. In the past I've found it difficult to stick to any kind of routine so for the past 6 months I've worked specifically on hamstring flexibility. I've utilised both active and passive stretching most days (little and often) and have gone from not being able to touch my toes to palms on the floor.

My question is: Have any of you noticed much of a difference in your climbing after working on flexibility? 

In his book "9 out of 10 climbers", Dave MacLeod seems to consider flexibility as a fairly minor contribution to performance in climbing but then I've noticed certain pro climbers eg. Jan Hojer have put in considerable work on their flexibility. Also, the Japanese team are well known for incorporating a lot of stretching into their training. Thoughts?
Question about training for sport climbing in a bouldering gym I won’t be able to get to outdoor climbing for the next 2 months due to my schedule. My question is if my weekly schedule is a good way to train for sport climbing if I only have access to a bouldering gym 2-3 times a week? On the 2-3 visits to the gym , I’ll do 1 day bouldering, 1 day 4 by 4 for endurance, and one day of hang boarding repeater or max hang 4 sets and some weights and core .   About me : I’m almost 40 years old , I’ve been climbing for almost 5 years, the first 3 years mostly outdoor Trad and sport, and some random gym bouldering here and there, hardest redpoint outdoor grade is 5.11c/d (did only 3-4 routes of the grade). Gym boulder up to hard v5 soft v6 depending.  Any suggestions are appropriated, thanks.
Anybody have healthy before bed snacks? Thinking something with a decent amount of protein but not a lot of sugar.. cause yeah I’m hungry right now but don’t want to be kept up by having a sugary protein bar.
I Suck At Hangboarding, Is This Normal? (Tension Flash vs vs mounted) Hey gang,

I’ve been climbing just shy of a year, and am just starting to ramp up to some proper training. I travel for work, and I only have the weekends to climb, so I’m trying to focus on weight loss and core strength, and just got the Tension Flash hangboard to bring with me for whenever there are trees outside the hotel, so I could maybe keep some finger strength during these next few months. I’d seen some rave reviews for it on this subreddit and was excited about it for sure. 

Trouble is… I suck at the thing. I can hang on the biggest edge of that bad boy (20mm?) for maybe three seconds. I assumed I was horrible, and just needed a lot more time to learn. I’ve always been decent at crimpy routes compared to my climbing partners so I was a little surprised, but not too thrown off. 

My recent development though is: I hopped on my gym’s mounted hangboard on the way out the door recently and could go maybe… 30 sec? maybe longer (?) on the same edge depth. I was in a rush and lost track tbh, but is this normal? Am I setting up the flash board wrong? Is the light slope in the flash board’s 20mm edge that much harder to hold? Is its hanging design just harder to keep holding on to? 

(this is the board I got if that helps https://www.tensionclimbing.com/product/flash-board/)
Tapering: an underused method of improving performance? From my experience, many climbers pre-trip routine looks something like this; train as much as possible right before the trip and then take a few days off. Don't do this! Plenty of studies have shown a significant performance improvement from tapering- a reduction in training volume in the weeks preceding a performance period such as a trip. 

So what do the studies say about how you should alter your training?

Intensity- keep intensity of your training high

Volume- reduce the volume of training by (very roughly) 50% either through reducing length or number of sessions. I haven't found any studies suggesting which would be more beneficial, but from other knowledge I would suggest primarily reducing length of sessions rather than number

Length of taper- No definitive answer, but studies seem to suggest 2 weeks might be the most beneficial but benefits can be gained anywhere between 1-4 weeks

Type of taper- no studies for strength sports about what type is most effective, but studies in endurance sports seem to suggest a gradual reduction in volume (i.e 75% volume halfway through the taper) 

After your taper it's still recommended to take off a few days before the start of the trip - somewhere between 2 and 6 days.

I'm not an expert I've just been reading around the topic so if anyone has anything to add that would be great- hopefully this info will help you guys gain that extra few percent performance on your next trip
What are the japanese team doing differently? In the youth world championships, in the first 3 categories, Japan got 6 out of 9 medals.

They didn't used to be this dominant, long gone are the days of Akiyo out there on her own, they've all got so, so much better.

What do you think they're doing differently to everyone else?

They're not just good at the weird new style, but also all brutally strong, for instance this - https://streamable.com/s/07rxw/hfhels?fbclid=IwAR0n-mX3ztMQya3_W6GANnzBuGCj6Y1h7oN-Jf307GYE05oUlunqbZjstv4

Generalized Tips and Resources for Beginners Hi, I've been climbing for a whopping two point five months now. I'm absolutely stoked on it, however I don't have a regular climbing partner than has any more experience than I do. So I've been pouring through the youtubes and the googles, lurking around this sub, watching other climbers at the gym - whatever I can get my hands on to learn more about the sport. The problem is there is SO much information out there and being new it can be hard to know what/whos advice to take.

At this point the biggest recommendation seems to be just climb - and that makes complete sense, but I want to at least be *aware* of what good technique is when climbing, things I can do to prevent injuring myself and generally work smarter not harder when on the wall - I suspect some other new climbers feel the same.

What I am hoping to do here is come up with a list of basics that can help new (0-1yr?) climbers refer to that the community feels is solid general guidance. Listed below is some of the advice that I've seen repeated er.. repeatedly. Please let me know if there's anything that isn't useful or is outdated or just plain incorrect. I do realize there are no hard rules in climbing but some resources on where to get started can be very useful when you are new.

Thanks for any feedback provided! I am not claiming to know whats best for anyone, none of these are original thoughts, I'm just trying to conglomerate good information. I will edit/update the post with any supported suggestions. This will be very helpful exercise for me - hopefully helpful to others down the road as well.

If you are a new climber: Please don't get hung up on any of this, beyond safety for yourself and others, climbing is about enjoyment!

# General Tips n Tricks

**Starting Out**

* Just climb...   To learn to climb better you must climb more regularly! Get used to moving on the wall, try different problems/holds/grades, learn not to fear the fall (and fall properly), have fun!!!!!!
* ...but don't climb too much!   Overuse injuries are very common in new climbers! Tendons take longer to develop and strengthen than your muscles do. The most common recommendation I have seen is to climb **\~three** days a week for **\~two** hours max (dependent on climbing intensity), with at least **two** sleeps between each climbing session. Don't be afraid to take a rest day or week(s) if you need it! Better to skip a few sessions than several months worth!
* Get help from someone experienced when selecting your first pair of shoes. Sizes/stretch/fit varies with brands. Having well fitted shoes are essential on the wall.

**Before you Climb**

* Always do a partner check before climbing. Learn proper belaying communication. Is that carabiner actually locked properly? Check knots. Are you tied/clipped in to the correct part of your harness? Have you actually been shown the correct way to use this gym's autobelay? Gym staff will be happy to help, if you aren't sure, ask.
* Do *dynamic* stretching **before** climbing and warm up properly on some easy routes. Do *static* stretching **after** climbing. There is a lot of information about this online now. So much I don't feel comfortable recommending any specific video/routine here. Don't skip these.

**On the Wall**

* Use your legs! You've probably already heard this before ever touching the climbing wall. Keep the weight over them as you move. This is much harder on steeper rock where you need to actively push into the wall to remove loading from your arms. Leg strength &gt; arm strength. Fact. Science.
* Avoid pulling yourself up with your arms. Climbing with bent arms is going to tucker them out quickly. Ideally your arms are used primarily for balance and your legs primarily for pushing yourself up the wall. Keeping your  [arms straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYD06dY5e74)  when possible can help with this (this is very useful while resting). The arms should still be engaged to avoid putting strain on your joints but your weight should be on your legs.
* Be more conscious about foot placement. I found I always wanted to look up and only briefly check where the footholds were. I wasn't watching my foot as I stepped onto the hold. Thinking about what I was doing with my feet really chained into being more aware about how my body was moving as a whole.
* So what is [good foot placement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5L3NS5v_hU)?  Good footwork implies almost always moving on your toes. Using your toes (especially your big toe) gives a much more flexible point of contact, allowing  you to shift weight, add and drop pressure, push off explosively... it’s  just the basis for giving your legs options while on the wall. Flat feet or putting the ball of your foot on the hold restrict your options considerably. Smaller footholds now become easier since you are able to apply greater pressure (same strength downwards,  though on a smaller surface) against the hold, making it harder to slip  and fall.  Don't be frustrated if you aren't able to put your entire weight on your big toe initially! Like everything else this will come with time and practice. Credit to  u/addygoldberg, u/the_frickerman, and u/bmmy9f for this tip.
* u/nurkdurk suggested an excellent exercise to reinforce the importance of leg/footwork: Find a top rope slab and climb it without using any hand holds. Palms flat against the wall only. Don't worry about taking a route, use whichever footholds you can. The idea is to build trust in your foot placement and learn how to shift your centre of gravity for balance. Take your time doing this exercise when you begin, experiment with your hip positions and different ways of moving to the next hold.
* Practice gripping the holds as lightly as you need to to stay on the wall when you are climbing your normal routes. This saves on that precious arm strength and keeps weight over those legs. I think one video suggested pretending the handholds are light bulbs so you will intuitively grip them with as little force as possible.
* You can use your core to help keep weight off your arms. This gets especially true on steep rock where new climbers (me!) have a tendency to let their hips droop down so they end up hanging on their arms. Engaging your lower core in these times will push your hips forward which lets you use your legs in a way that's closer to being on a vertical wall. Keep in mind the amount you need to engage your core should remain as little as needed to produce this '[body tension](http://www.selfcoachedclimber.com/2012/10/body-tension-what-is-it-anyway/)' effect of shifting your centre of gravity towards the wall. u/k43r has posted a simple but [effective drawing](http://i.imgur.com/ljji7L5.png) of this previously. And check out #1 in the  [5 Biomechanical Tips to Improve Your Climbing Technique](https://www.mountainsportperformance.com/blog/2018/7/30/5-biomechanical-tips-to-improve-your-climbing-technique)  by [u/stoneyviolist](https://www.reddit.com/user/stoneyviolist/).
* Learn the [difference between static and dynamic climbing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p1jUNuVjXQ) and experiment with them. It feels more natural to climb statically (at least for me it definitely did) but climbing dynamically and using momentum better is satisfying and has helped me on problems for sure
* Focus on doing current grade climbs well before forcing a higher grade poorly. Trying a higher grade to is absolutely not a bad thing but keep your focus and time on climbing those 5.9s flawlessly before spending all your time on 5.10x. If you barely scrape your way through a route. Good! Now see if you can climb it again with better technique.

**While You're Resting**

* Watch other climbers! This can be at the gym or even on Youtube. It can be especially useful to watch a more experienced climber do the same problem you are working on. However, do remember that different people will have different ways of tackling the same problem, especially those with height/strength differences.
* The climbing community as a whole are very friendly. Respect that but also enjoy it and put it to use! Most people will happy to answer questions or chat about problems. Or if you go by yourself like I do sometimes many people offer to belay out of the goodness of their hearts.

**Off the Wall/Training/Recovery**

* To reiterate: the best training for climbing is climbing. Just have fun on the wall!
* You don't need to hangboard! Yes your finger strength is currently lacking as a new climber but the consensus seems to be hangboarding in the first year of climbing is likely to lead to over-use injuries on those tender finger tendies. Besides, are you really failing that 5.10x/V4 because of your fingers alone? Just climb!
* [Antagonist training](https://www.climbing.com/skills/antagonist-workouts-for-climbers-improve-performance-and-prevent-injury/), yoga, and core exercises are three of the top mentioned supportive workouts for climbing and/or injury prevention. Personally I find yoga between sessions really feels fantastic on my freshly wrecked muscles. Here are a couple easier yoga routines directed at climbers:

[Yoga with Adrienne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yOtsZNU4Us)

* **Sleep well, eat well.**  Yes I know, duh. But it's important for recovery and sustained training.
* For those interested in rice bucket exercises here's one I've seen mentioned. Have not tried. Heard good things.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Good you should be climbing instead anyway.

Thank you very much for the gold
Any solutions to sweaty hands? I've tried different brands of chalk, used antiperspirants but to no avail. Okay so I have this issue with my sweaty hands. I live in a tropical country so I tend to sweaty a lot. My hands sweat way too much and it's so frustrating when I climb especially on slopers and volumes. Like I can do 1-2 moves on fiberglass volumes and then my hands are soaked. 

The sweat also mixes with the chalk on my hand before I climb and it makes this fragile artificial skin appear on my skin. When I climb with this 'artificial skin' it wears off easily and then causes friction to be horrible as if it wasn't frustrating enough. If I rub my hands together when the sweat and chalk has mixed it causes this 'eraser dust' to appear.

So far I have tried tite-grip and PD9 antiperspirants. They completely have no effect on me apart from wasting 20 bucks each. I don't have access to antihydral unless I pay $40USD to ship a $6 product.

I haven't used many chalk brands but so far Tokyo Powder Industries and Loop Chalk gives me the same issue of 'artificial skin'.
BETA for Black Beauty 8B on the Moonboard Hi,

*I apologize but I have absolutely no idea where/who to ask these questions, so Reddit might be the tunnel to, say, international beta.*

I am trying to climb this famous problem by Daniel Woods, called Black Beauty, which is graded 8B.

My current level is 8B boulder / 8c+ route, so this problem is very challenging.

Although the reasons for pursuing something almost useless and artificial like this might be questionable, I would still be curious if there is somebody here that has actually tried or even did this problem.

Footage from D. Woods: [https://www.instagram.com/p/BO-RzbcALCg/?hl=de](https://www.instagram.com/p/BO-RzbcALCg/?hl=de)

¨Ravioli Biceps¨ on Instagram also has a nice video of it, but I can´t paste the link here.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So getting into specifics, it breaks down into 3 moves:

1. Start -&gt; undercling
2. Undercling -&gt; pinch
3. Pinch -&gt; top

&amp;#x200B;

What I can do: I can get to the point where I am matching the undercling and already established with the left foot on the starting hold ready to generate movement towards the pinch, but I can´t generate enough momentum.

I have replaced the undercling with a jug and then I did it easily.

So this seems to be a finger strength problem, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, the move from the pinch to the top is also no joke, haven´t got much beta on that either.

I see u/Miles_Adamson you frequently post valuable advice here, maybe you have experience with this boulder problem which you would be willing to share in exchange for some beers of course?

Thanks!
Broken clavicle, 8 weeks in and grim Looking for others to share their story. I broke my clavicle 8 weeks ago mountain biking. A few millimeters of separation, a few millimeters of overlap, decided against surgery because it wasn't deemed necessary. Currently on week 8, xray looks more or less the same, and the doc said 6 weeks until I might be able to start resistive physical therapy.

Has anyone had a similar experience with a broken bone? I was originally thinking after 2 months I could start doing some light climbing, but now it's looking to be double that. Trying to stay motivated, but you upper body gets a lot weaker after 4 months of nothing.
Full A2 tear Hey community,

  
I need help. Long story short, I was trying a route that is at the limit of my ability, and felt a sharp pain. I may have heard a crunchy noise, but no pop. I'm lucky and got it ultrasounded by a very competent doctor, but not so lucky in that he told me I fully tore my A2. I was/am devastated. I have full ROM, a little bit of swelling, but that's it. Originally it was very swollen. It's been about a week since I tore it. I've never been in better shape and have been progressing nicely over the past two years. The rest of my pulleys are intact, so surgery is not indicated.  


Has anyone here suffered through this? Can I recover? Will I return to full strength? How long? So many questions, I'm wondering what the common experience is... I've read all the basic lit out there, so no need to link to those Grade II charts :)  


Thanks.
What happened to the injury thread? Every other post right now is about someone’s strained pulley.  Have people just stopped posting in the injury thread?
Thesis on climbing Hi!
I'll be writing my thesis soon in physiotherapy but I still haven't decided on a subject. I think it would be interesting to have it about climbing. Do you have any ideas on what to do? Where do you think evidence is lacking when it comes to climbing harder?
What stretches help with stepping higher? I'm not very flexible and a lot of the times when climbing I can't get my foot up high enough. Sometimes if I can let go of one hold I have to grab my knee and pull it up to get my foot up. I'm always coming up an inch or two short. What are some stretches to give me a higher step?

For those with busy schedules, how do you stay strong? Do you have a training regimen that works best for you? I am a currently a full-time graduate student that's working full-time. I don't have time to get to the crag. Moreover, I can only get to the gym about three times a week. I'd really like to maintain my strength and/or get stronger. I trad climb, boulder, and sport climb. However, I'd like to focus on sport climbing. Do any of you have training regimens or tips for people with busy schedules?
How to train for long days in the mountains? (Multipich trad climbing) I'm 17 years old sport climber and I want to switch to a trad climbing. I know this style is more dangerous so i left a year for a preparation (i will take some courses and etc.). But I don't want to just go sport climbing in this one year i want to build a base with a high endurance level which will make my progression faster in multipich climbing once i'm ready for it. 

So now I'm training 4-5 times a week, doing the things every sport climber should do (a lot of climbing, hangboard training, antagonist, core training and etc...). I want to ask what should i increment in my training and what should i remove to build a base for the long days in the mountains? Running? Cycling? Hiking? Doing more routes than boulders (now i'm working on more boulders than route, because i realised that it is helping me progress faster)? And how much of those things i should do?
Looking for feedback on the dyno of this problem (The Dali V8), I can't stick it and am having trouble determining good body positioning. Thoughts? [deleted]
What training facilities would you look for in your dream climbing gym? I've been climbing for 6 years and training more seriously for the last few years so am moderately experience with climbing and climbing training, though there's still so much to learn. I've been asked to design and build the training portion of a new climbing gym in Australia, and I wanted to see what opinions were out there on climbharder.

If price weren't an issue, what would you love in your dream climbing gym? Dream big! Otherwise, what is a gym that you know of/climb at with awesome training facilities? 

Thanks in advance, you crushers!
Climbing less made me stronger (more details) I've been climbing (mostly bouldering...mostly plastic) for over four years. I have basically plateaued for a solid year or two, despite many efforts to get stronger. I've tried hangboarding, campusing, limit bouldering, etc., but it mostly just fatigued me at best and injured me at worst. 

Then, this past summer my partner (both life and climbing) and I had the opportunity to spend two months on the road. It was the best two months of my life. Climbing/bouldering was a huge part of the summer, but certainly not our sole focus. We probably averaged about 3, maybe 4, days of climbing per week. Often one of these days was spent bouldering and the others were spent essentially learning how to stay calm climbing above gear. This translated into much less stress on my body compared to the intensity of consistent gym climbing (or training).

After two months on the road we moved into a new apartment and began news jobs (back to the real world). That meant a return to the reality of the gym during the week and trying to get outside on the weekend. When I came back to the gym I was certainly weaker than the beginning of the summer. My body just wasn't used to the volume and intensity of bouldering in a gym. But after a couple weeks I felt strong again, maybe even stronger...and well rested. I tested myself on the moonboard, and had the best moonboard session I've ever had. The following week I sent my hardest moonboard problem to date. 

Two months of reduced climbing made me stronger than any training ever did.

My big take away from this is the importance of rest! We (at least I) get so caught up trying to train and get strong that we end up doing more harm than good. Remember, we aren't all olympic athletes, and we probably shouldn't treat our bodies as if they are.
Synovitis treated, but I also need your extra help! There seems to be no one-size-fits-all approach, and many posts about synovitis in this sub, so I thought I'd add my personal experience of how I treated mine, especially since I couldn't find the same method suggested elsewhere.  It's simplicity surprised me.

The TLDR: time off and finger extensors exercises using a theraband.

I'll preface that I don't have a doctors diagnosis that I actually had synovitis, but I had all the typical symptoms:
- Buldging stiff (PIP) joints
- Pain if knocking PIP joints against hard surfaces
- Unable to fully close or open affected fingers, with restriction/sensitivity felt all at the PIP joint
- No pain climbing, unless I blow off holds

Symptom areas:
- Pinky, Ring and Middle fingers
- Both hands
- All PIP joint

Below is the list of things I tried whilst still climbing 3-4 times a week:
- Weighted finger curls (low intensity, high volume)
- Voodoo flossing
- Stretching (in all 4 directions)
- 2 and 3 finger drags on hang board (feet on, 6s on, 6s off, x8 at end of climbing sesh)
- Not using chisel or crimp when climbing
- Tumeric supplements
- Voltaren gel directly on swollen joints

Whilst still climbing and trying all the above over 3 weeks, the condition did not improve. 

I decided to take 2 weeks off climbing and did:
- Stretching (2 directions, closed and open.  No side bending/twisting)
- Finger extensor exercises using a theraband (40 reps, 3 sets, 3-5 min rest bw sets, 3-5 times a day, every day.  Feeling of 7-9 out of 10 fatigue level each set)
- Tumeric 
- Voltaren
- Avg 7-8 hours sleep per night

I reckon the high frequency finger extensor exercises were the magic bullet for me.  I felt immediate improvement after a day, compared to the minimal improvement from 2 days of passive rest between deciding to take time off, and starting this method.  Obviously, taking time off with adequate sleep was also crucial.
 
I continued off-wall training during the 2 weeks of no climbing:
- Wrist curls (for rehab mainly)
- Heavy weighted barbell finger curls (to preserve hand strength; this did not irritate the synovitis)
- Deadlifts
- Squats
- Shoulder presses
- Benchpress
- General shoulder system strengthening 
 
The two weeks off was a great chance to rehab the fingers, rebalance the body, and re-ignite the psych.  When I return I plan to:
- Strengthen open hand and drag grip
- Apply the two grips more when climbing
- Continue extensor exercises and finger stretches

Here are the photos way before, and now.  I've got knotty hands, so my knuckles are naturally bulgy, but you can see the reducing in swelling.

http://imgur.com/a/9pyhDuV

Hope this helps.  

If anyone can't shut their fingers completely, but have managed to treat them so they can close fully, I'd love to hear from you.  The treatment above has improved my ROM heaps, I'm just wondering if the final step to achieving full ROM is to keep persisting or add something else. 

Cheers
Magnus Mitdbo's interview with Alexander Huber As far as I'm aware this video has been posted in the r/climbing Reddit but not here, so I figured there might be some people who haven't seen it.  I really enjoyed it and think it is worth a watch, this guy pretty much laid the foundations of what this subreddit is discussing today. My take on it is:  


* W̶o̶l̶f̶g̶a̶n̶g̶ ̶G̶ü̶l̶l̶i̶c̶h̶ Alexander Huber as a person is nothing short of impressive: He is the first person to ever climb 5.15. He was one of the few people establishing the campus and system boards and training as we know it today.
* Magnus is doing a great Job of asking the right question and bulding an intimate atmosphere.
* There are some nice anecdotes of the old days that are funny in the context of this reddit. Take his liquid diet consisting of nothing solid but only soup yogurt and three beers (!) in the evening :D
* Beautifully shot, great scenery and music to complete the picture.  


If you haven't seen it, I would definitly recommend to check it out!

Do you really "Clip it or whip it"? I'm not the strongest climber, but the number one thing I need to work on is my mental game. 

In the gym, I'm all about "clip it or whip it". Even if I'm so pumped I know I couldn't even hold a water bottle - I'll still go for it. Outside is another story though. A lot of routes around where I climb are bolted 10+ feet between bolts.

How do you project this kind of stuff? Do you really "clip it or whip it"?
Falling with a shaky belay So, I'm new to leading. Been toproping quite a while at the gym and I have no problems there. I never worry about decking and consequently, I'll go for larger dynamic moves without fear. I've taken some good spins and hit the wall a few times as a result. 

But, I'm growing progressively more scared of falling on lead. My regular gym partners is... well, he sucks at belaying on lead. Same guy belaying as when I'll dyno on TR. On lead, I constantly get short roped while clipping and then, bizarrely, he leaves tons of slack in the system after. So basically every fall I take while he's on belay is much larger than I expect.

I don't want to not lead with him or not have him belay me. We boulder together and he's fine spotting me. Plus, since we're both new to leading, I don't want to be judgemental. Also, to get better he needs practice (as do I, being new to it), so I don't want to cut him off from the practice he needs.

I'm stuck, though. I don't feel comfortable taking falls while simultaneously, need him to practice catching falls. I've mentioned the short-roping and he's improving there, slowly. But, what would you do in this situation? Soldier on? Take tons of falls from below the bolt? Mock lead (not my favorite. two ropes is clumsy and time consuming)?
Drills to improve technique? Have you found any improvement in your technique by practicing a drill or set of drills? What are these drills and how often do you do them.
fear and onsighting. who wants to play climbing therapist? really struggling with what are apparently some major mental blocks lately. The following is long as I am attempting to sort this out for myself. Could also use some advice from here. Been climbing about 8 years, pretty consistently, started learning on trad and still prefer it. But I really want to push into 5.11 trad onsighting and getting **faster** at leading pitches in the alpine.

thanks for reading any amount of this and for any advice.

2 main issues I've identified:

1. fear of falling
2. fear of trying hard

how the eff do i get over fear of falling.

I am mostly trad climbing, but some sport. But the fear is actually almost worse on sport routes. I'm comfortable being super run-out on moderate terrain, pretty chill even on some 5.9R slabs i've climbed. Because I can do every move static, and reverse/downclimb almost every move and find a stance on any climb 5.10 or below. 5.11 and up that is not the case.

yes, i've whipped on gear and continue to do so. yes I fall regularly in the gym. yes I've read rock warriors way (and the tennis version and the weightlifting version), and I understand them. what I got out of that book was that you don't have to let fear make your decisions because, really, you have the choice at almost any point to either accept the risk and commit, or back off. my problem is that in many circumstances I do not accept the risk of falling if I do not feel I can make the move from my current stable stance to the next stable stance.

I can onsight most 10s in almost any style, but barely climb any 11s. Even on 5.10 onsites I find myself just hanging out, locked off, in the crux moves chalking up repeatedly and testing holds, convincing myself to do the next move. I think I am way stronger than I need to be for the grades I climb - my aerobics are way overdeveloped - when I do finally convince myself to pull moves after hanging out in a "rest" stance and chalking up repeatedly, the moves often feel very easy (Self dialog: "why didn't I just DO that when I first saw the holds instead of hanging out getting pumped for 3 minutes").  Whether the bolt or gear is at my waist or below my feet doesn't seem to matter. It's whether I can intuit how the move will work and where my next stance is before I do it. I especially have a hard time committing to more insecure-feeling hold types that only work for one body position - i know if I move my body out of position towards the next hold, then that hold won't work any more and if the next hold (which I can't see/feel yet) isn't good then something in my brain wont let me leave the safe body position.

on harder routes (5.10-11 and up) it is often difficult to read the sequences well enough and quickly enough to climb the route successfully. the problem is that if I can't see the next stance or gear I am often unwilling to make the move to a higher position. unless the fall line is super clean.

when I am climbing harder than 10s I simply can't just "hang out" in the crux while I search for the optimal feet and the next stance. I climb very slowly and methodically, planning out each foot chip and body position so that I am arriving at the next stance is the maximally secure position to prevent falling.

As a consequence of this I am often afraid to "try hard" because trying hard often means just going for it which means I could peel off unexpectedly if I come to a hold in the wrong body position. Or it means doing something near my physical limit which means I could fail physically and fall in a weird body position.

Another thing is that my mind steers me away from routes that I know will take a lot of focus/tension/trying hard and as a result I don't get on hard things as often as I could. I've noticed I've been making decisions in the second half of a crag day like "yeah well I could lead that 5.11 but its going to be kind of hard, and I'm a little bit tired by now, this 5.8 I've done before sounds nice and relaxing so lets climb that"

I think my major climbing weaknesses, physically, are core/body tension foremost and finger+lockoff strength second. I have the most trouble with steep routes and locking off on small crimps. I am really focusing on on these weaknesses in the gym has resulted in many crux sequences going quite easily... on top rope. So the training is working, I accept that it takes time, but my head game seems like it is REGRESSING with time.

I really want to tackle this issue. It would make me faster at leading pitches too, I'm pretty slow even on 5.7s as I always methodically figure out the puzzle of what is the "most optimally secure way possible" to do this 5.7 move when I probably don't need to do it with perfect beta since I'm strong enough. I climb like a soloist

my main climbing goals are getting fast enough and good enough at onsighting to do mega-long sustained 5.10 lines (e.g. on the Hulk, B-C, freeblast) but it would be nice to also be able to get on some 12s at the sport crag and commit to hard moves above a bolt. One tactic I use is that I will climb incrementally 1 move above the bolt and fall. Then 2 moves, fall. 3 moves, fall etc. Like if a move is hard I need to prove to myself that every spot in the sequence is OK to fall from. but my judgement of what is a safe fall seems unnecessarily skewed towards "nothing is ever safe to fall on"
How old are you? What age did you start climbing? What age did you peak (if at all)? Curious to know what age everyone’s at.  I’m 33 and started climbing 1 year and 3 months ago at age 32.

Submaximal hangboarding? This past summer I've been doing quite a bit of submaximal hangboarding. I was mostly doing this for maintenance as a way of keeping my fingers healthy. Since I was bouldering outside every weekend, the usual max hangs routine I've done in the past seemed like a bit too much.

Surprisingly, I have seen some pretty good gains from this. I recently tested my max hang, and I blew away my previous high. I can also say that this summer has been the healthiest my fingers have ever felt. 

I was wondering if anyone else has seen good results from submaximal hangs? Were the hangs actually improving my finger strength or is the key here just avoiding injuries?
Max Hangs Vs Moonboard for Finger Strength Hey folks,

Recently started moonboarding and been getting a kick out of how much it crushes my ego- however, I've been having Moonboard sessions as a substitute for max hangs in an attempt to reconcile 'just climb more' with specific goals in mind, as well as working general neurological adaption / getting used to tension, full engagement climbing.

However, I'm wondering whether it really is the best way of training finger strength and interested to know others thoughts. Is it possible to do both at once at this stage in my climbing? I'm used to a fairly high volume of training, but conscious of injury prevention.

it's too soon for me to make a personal judgement just yet, but my inclination is that Moonboarding is a better strength tool because it forces me to learn movement patterns too- I felt the aftereffects of Moonboard sessions in my forearms far more than I ever did with max hangs and even with maximal effort.

it feels so good to get my ass kicked too
Cannot pinpoint a vague tricep injury and looking for similar experiences A few weeks ago, I made a fairly dynamic move and loaded my left arm heavily. I felt some "crunching", came off of it and had pain/soreness around my shoulder area. Some radiating general pain was going on and I couldn't raise my arm above my head for a few days. 

[These areas marked in red](https://i.imgur.com/SMbkjVX.png) are where residual pain occurs on certain motions and actions. 

I have seen a sports therapist and she attributes it to tight obliques, sudden load of my shoulder and generally tight shoulder girdle resulted in some sort of severe strain. She suspects the shoulder blade isn't retracting properly and is causing the pain, and there are possible serratus issues as well. Hard to say what exactly happened without an MRI.

As of now, trying to rehab, but any sort of "pull-up" motion seriously hurts my general tricep area, yet when I do certain tricep exercises, it doesn't hurt at all.

**CAN DO**

* Dips
* Strict push ups 
* Face pulls
* Bicep curls
* OAH 

**CANNOT DO (or with a moderate amount of pain)**

* Pull ups
* Rows
* Kickbacks

Has anyone had a similar experience and can share some thoughts/wisdom?

Thanks!
How to use the moonboard guide. In this post i want to share my experience with the moonboard and help some new climbers to use it as effective as possible. If some of the more experienced climbers disagree with something feel free to comment. 

1. The moonboard is pretty good tool for getting stronger while climbing and having fun. As a lot of people say that climbing is most of the time better than just training on the campus board, hangboard or doing pull ups. For everyone that isn't in the 8a or even higher redpoint grade it isn't necessary to go campus board and there you meet the moonboard. Effectively training the power of your fingers and body muscles, learning you how to step and get the connection from the toes to the fingers it's an incredible tool. 

2. How to use it?
   2.1. As projecting a hard boulder. I would suggest not doing this for more than 30-40 minutes if you are new to the moonboard, because you can start being very tired, very soon without realising it and injure yourself easily. 
    2.2 As getting some volume on it. Most of the time i use this type of training, doing some boulders in the flash range for me, where i do 5-6 boulders 3-4 times with 3 minutes rest. This makes me feel tired just like training on the campus board and and still making me a better climber, while also training the core muscles. I have to note that this type of training can be used from the better climbers, because the easiest boulders on the moonboard is 6b+ and you have to be confident with the style of climbing. 
    2.3 As doing 4x4 on the moonboard. For me this is something difficult to do, but it's probably the best way to get in shape for a rock climbing trip, because the style of the moonboard (one pad holds and big moves) is training similar muscles that you need in rock climbing, as most of the times you climb on tiny holds and side pulls. As most of the boulders setted in the gym features big volumes and strange technique betas they are good with making you a better climber, but not so good for training your muscles for the rock itself. 

One more note i want to share is that novice climbers that can't do easily the easiest boulder on the moonboard can injure themselves much easier (i did the same mistake a long time ago). 

Moonboard for me is the better version of the campus board, as long as you're not a pro and need some exclusively isolated power training. 

Good luck and sent hard!
Critique this climb (my first 12a; 8th try). In general I am weaker on overhangs - with this climb I improved by bringing my feet higher, however I still did not feel like I was fully weighing feet fully, creating more work for my arms. How do I improve my body tension?
When to transition from "just climb more" to specific training exercises (ie, hangboarding, campusing, etc)? I'm currently climbing around .12c and V6. Made a goal to climb .14a and V10 in the next 5 years. My climbing training to now has focused mostly on "just climbing more" with a lot of emphasis on making sure I'm using good technique and not just putting in a bunch of garbage laps on the wall. That's worked pretty well to now, and I think I can continue to make progress using it as my primary form of training, but I doubt it will get me all the way to my goal. 

So, my question is, at what point should I start to bring more "focused" training activities into my routines? Things like fingerboarding, campusing, weighted pullups, etc? I'd like to avoid these activities for as long as possible (afraid of injury, and they're just less fun than actual climbing), but also want to make progress toward my goals. Any thoughts on when to start incorporating these things? Is there a specific grade I should be targeting? Some other kind of physical marker? Just wait until I start to plateau really hard?
How do you find a competent PT? I live in Miami.... obviously climbing here is mostly indoors.  How do those who live in non-climbing communities find professional help with injuries?

I'm very picky about that stuff... my PCP used to be a cyclist, and I was cycling back then.

Ideally, I would like a PT who also climbs, or at least has experience in climbing.  I wouldnt want someone who is just a sports doc or something like that.  Besides talking to other climbers in the area, how do you go about seeing someone?
Training Feedback Hi!  I'm hoping to get some feedback on my training program.

I'm a 34-year-old female, climbing for about 8 years.  I'm primarily a sport climber: Max redpoint is 12d.  Max flash is 12a.  Onsight most 11's.  My goal is to be regularly redpointing 13b/c in the next year.  I was recovering from a big injury this year and really was able to start training/climbing hard again this spring. As a side note, I have been prioritizing training and drinking pretty much nothing at all (like 1 drink a month), really focusing on a healthy diet with high protein, and getting good sleep.

In general, I think my weaknesses have been power of all kinds, dynamic movement, and finger strength.  I've really improved my dynamic movement by just practicing this in the gym, and I no longer feel this is a major weakness, but something I should continue to work on.  My last trip this summer (Rifle), I was able to do all the moves on my 12+ projects pretty quickly, but didn't have the power endurance to put them together.

I've been learning about training as I go, and I realize now I've made a few mistakes thus far that I"ll try to note.  However, I'm sure there's many more I've made, and I welcome any and all feedback!

**Recent training:**

A 9-week strength building phase.  I realize this was a little long, but coming back from injury I felt I needed to really rebuild and then add.

Training day 1: 20 min ARC warm up, 3x5 Weighted pull ups, 1x4-6 max hangs, 1x5 deadlift, 60 min limit bouldering, 3x10 overhead press, 20-30 minutes core (hanging leg lifts, ring roll-outs, ball pikes)

Rest day - typically run 3 miles

Training day 2: Pretty much the same, with an added PE component such as 4x4s or (more usually) 6-in-6/10-in-10

Rest day- typically run 3 miles

2 outside projet days

1 full rest day per week

I took a deloading week every fourth week.  I would feel really good week 1, and pretty much felt super tired and fatigued all through weeks 2 and 3.  I realize now I probably shouldn't have been adding in a PE component at all.  I also now realize that if I was going to do ARC at all, it prob should've been at the end of a session.  Although I think the ARC may have been helpful coming fresh back to sport climbing from injury, I'm not sure I would include it in the future.

Overall I saw a lot of gains from this.  I increased my weighted pull up from 0 to 20 pounds, Max hangs on 18mm from 0 to 12.5 pounds, saw noticeable improvement in my gym boulder flash and project grades, and definitely feeling overall stronger, fitter, and better climbing outside.

I now want to transition to a focus on utilization.

**For two weeks I have been:**

Training day 1: Warm up on boulders 20-30 minutes. 3x5 weighted pull ups. Eva Lopez repeaters protocol. 3x10 overhead press. 20 minute campus workout (I'm very new to this.  This basically consists of ladders and then 1-4 and then matching on starting rung; going to stop this though and swap out for Tension Board session). An Cap work out of "circuit" of 2 boulder problems with 1.5 minute rest x 12 and then Aero Pow work out of 10-in-10.  Want to swap out for 4x4s as these overall feel harder for me. 20 minutes of core as above.

Training day 2: I've been climbing outside for about 5 pitches trying to do a route pyramid, getting pretty pumped and trying up to 12c.

(rest and project days have been the same)

**Current Outdoor Performance:**

This week I "retro flashed" while hanging draws a previous-project from several years ago that goes at 12c, a climb with a crux down low and a boulder problem up top but plenty of endurance/resty climbing in between.

I'm currently projecting another 12c that I've put about 12 goes on (hopefully will send next session!).  This is basically a powerful, slightly over-hanging crimpy boulder problem with bad feet that I think might favor the tall.  There are essentially no hands rests before and after this 7-move problem with some 11- climbing before and after.  It feels nails hard to me for 12 c, and it took me at least 2 attempts to even do all the moves.

I feel like I can currently climb 12a without too much "tax", and although I may get pumped I can recover pretty quickly and fully at rests.

The above leads me to believe that my major area of weakness ATM may be AnCap/AnPower?  However, I don't want to lose the forest for the trees and am looking more long range.

**Changes I'm planning to make:**

I want to make Training Day 2 another focused gym training sessions, as I don't feel like I'm really getting the workout I want climbing outside this second day.  I want to swap campus board for moon board to continue to gain power but also work on dynamic movement and core tension. So, this week it may look more like Training Day 1 with a 40-60 minute Tension board session with some volume at flash grade for this first half and limit boulder attempts the second half (we'll see what I'm able to do maintaining high quality- I'm new to board training) and then an Aero Pow workout and Training Day 2 will be a Aero Cap and Aero Power training day.

**Some questions I have:**

Should I drop the weighted pull ups and core completely during this utilization phase? I've been nervous to lose my gains made during strength building, but also sometimes feel like this is too much time/energy.  What else would you tweak/change? Anything I'm not focusing on that I should?

I know some people will bring up my rest day running (which is sometimes mountain biking).  I know this is sometimes discouraged, but I feel like the cardio is good for me in general.  I have asthma and struggle on approaches, and I also like the positive effect it has on my weight control (my diet is good, but I'm also a 34 year old female...).  If I'm feeling super fatigued that day, I'll skip it and take the dogs on a long walk.  

This sub has been super helpful to me in learning about energy systems, training, and so many other things.  Thank you all in advance for any recommendations and feedback you have for me!

\*edit: some things :)
I can finally start climbing with regularity, so could really use advice on a workout plan / weekly routine to start improving I was initially going to post this in the weekly thread, but it seemed a bit to much to fit in there, if a post isn't appropriate for this, I apologize! 
  
By the grace of the climbing gods a brand new gym just opened a 3-minute walk from where I live. Prior to this one opening, I had been driving 20-60 minutes (depending on traffic) to climb no more than twice a week (I have a 1-year old, so before I just could not make more than twice a week possible). As such, I can finally start climbing with more regularity (can now go 5+ days a week).  
  
I've been plateau'd at a V4 / 5.11 level for almost a year - I tend to flash those grades with regularity, but once I start pushing V5 / 5.12 I really struggle (though I've managed my way up a couple). My question is: How do I start training to really improve myself to push higher grades? 
  
I've done minimal working out outside of bouldering (sets of pull ups and basic core workouts), but not much. I can now theoretically put in 5+ days a week to some sort of training / climbing, but I'm not sure how best to use my time. Can I start hangboarding at this point? How many days a week should I be taking off to rest? What should I spend my time doing while at the gym? I know it's a lot to ask, I'm just not sure how I should be spending my time to really start improving. I'm sure just simply forcing myself onto more V5/6s is one way I can really improve, but I would like to start training as well if that will help.  
  
Any input would be greatly appreciated!   
    
EDIT - Thank you so much for the help, I wasn't expecting such a big response! I really appreciate everyone's input
Why do you use open hand vs half crimp vs full crimp? I am interested in learning about which situations lend themselves to using one grip type over the other.

•full crimping for power?
•open hand for resting?
Why do climbers have bad posture? It seems like kinda a stereotype that climbers have bad posture, but why is that? I thought that rounded shoulders nerd neck etc were caused by over use/tightness of anterior muscles and weak back+rear delts.

Do you think this carry's over to climbing?  Anyone have any experience with this?
Tips for improving footwork when climbing outdoors In a gym it’s fairly easy and intuitive to focus on your foot work because the foot holds are obvious and marked with rubber. Outside though there seem to be countless options most of which don’t work and the long I search for a new foothold the more anxious I get and lose any sense of delicacy and precision. Sometimes it’s clear where to put with big holds but on harder climbs with bad feet I just panic and don’t know what to do.
Height, Climbing Performance and the Role of Weight At first glance, it seems that being taller is a handicap in rock climbing see [here for a reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/7z6tnj/does_height_matter/) discussion or [my own analysis here](http://climbstat.blogspot.com/2018/12/height-and-rock-climbing-performance.html).

I have taken a fresh look at this relationship. The fact that taller people also weight more (in absolute terms) seems to cause this negative correlation between height and weight. Being taller is likely neither an advantage nor a disadvantage when it comes to climbing once we consider weight.

A complete beginner climbers experience and recovery from a finger injury Hey all, a couple of months ago I posted across a number of climbing subreddits to try and better understand an injury I had in my right middle finger. This morning while browsing I saw yet another post, like mine, from a beginner climber requesting help with finger pain. I left a lengthy comment and thought it might be worth a post in the event that any new climber finds it and it helps them in any way shape or form.

To start with, being a beginner climber with an injury is difficult for a lot of reasons;

- A lot of climbing terms aren't understood (wtf is a pulley?)
- You don't understand your body enough to know when you can push your limits and when to take it easy
- Your technique and habits are likely injury promoting (always full crimping, over-training, muscles under developed which put more strain on soft tissue / tendons)
- "Traditional" doctors will promote rest which is often the worst thing you can do for soft tissue damage
- You might not have gotten to know fellow climbers well enough to ask them for advice, the internet is your only resource

Now for the x-post;

I had been struggling with a reoccurring A2 pulley injury in my right middle finger for a over a month. Symptoms were soreness while climbing and pain / tenderness when applying very light pressure on the A2 pad of the injured finger any time after climbing. I never heard a pop, never had any limited ROM and there was no swelling, but I could do nothing to prevent the pain. Opening doors, opening bottles, starting my car, everything would aggravate the injury.

I researched the hell out of the problem and from reading an endless amount of information I came to the following conclusions;

- The issue is well understood by only a subset of medical professionals
- "Traditional" doctors will advocate rest but that is one of the worst things you can do
- Active rehab and massage are required to strengthen damaged soft tissue and prevent scar tissue build up.
- A light return to climbing to follow

It's tough to find anything definitive on the internet because of the nature of hand / arm biology. Every injury can be such a large range of things from muscle imbalance to soft tissue damage to a flexor tendon tear and pain in the hand doesn't always indicate an issue in the hand, it could be an injury of tendons in the arm or vice versa.

Now for the anecdotal stuff.

For 4 weeks, every day I..;

- Abstained from climbing
- Did all rehab exercises talked about in the following video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWZQMnlHEbg)
- Massaged my finger daily
- Voodoo flossed, 10-15 times per day (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQuz-wsyy68)

In the event that you have some of the same questions I did;

- Yes, abstaining from climbing is hard
- You're right, Voodoo flossing isn't something with much support from the medical community. There simply haven't been enough studies to say conclusively whether or not it provides a benefit, but increased blood flow to an area can only aid in healing, and flossing forces blood into your extremities. At the worst, I'm wasting 5 minutes per day of my time, at best i'm aiding in recovery of something preventing me doing something I enjoy.

I returned to climbing last Thursday, I avoided any problem with a crimp in it and any problem that would apply pressure to my A2, this includes certain jugs, certain slopers, in fact, any hold can cause that pain. If you have a good enough understanding of your injury, you will know by just looking at a route which are likely to aggravate it.

I climbed again on Saturday with my friends. We all climb at the same level and it's honestly miserable watching them push their limits at the gym but i'm just thankful to be there, pain free. Having climbed twice since returning, i've had 2 or 3 brief occurrences of pain in the A2 but from what i've read, is entirely normal for a return following an injury. I can press on the A2 pain free, I can climb, albeit easy climbs, pain free. I'm going to continue to do this until i'm 100%. Once i'm 100%, the focus will be on prevention so that i'm never in this situation again.
Improve finger skin in four days? Dear Climbharder

Get me up my proj!

My current project (definitely one of the most beautiful sport routes I've ever been on) is a gently overhanging wall of gneiss on sharp crimps. I've done all the moves multiple times, and one-hanged it last Saturday - then couldn't even begin a serious attempt on Sunday because my tips hurt so badly.

What can I do to try to be able to put in multiple attempts boths days if necessary this coming weekend?
Measuring Limit Bouldering So I’ve been trying a dedicated limit boulder day for several weeks/maybe 2 months now. I’ve watched the Power Climbing videos, asked on here, and read several other articles to try and ensure I’m doing right with limit bouldering. I think I’m getting it. 

One question kind of arises though- how do we/you/should I measure limit bouldering progress? Is it being able to make a benchmark move with ease? Is it sending problems of higher grades? I feel like I’m improving but it’s hard to gauge. I’d suspect that with a well-balanced workout routine, limit bouldering is where you actually make your gains. I’d suspect that after you have a limit move dialed, you just naturally move on to harder single moves, but sometimes it seems like it’s almost *just* muscle memory after a few sessions.
Not pumped but running out of power In the past I could get heinously pumped. Nowadays I don't seem to get there anymore, instead I just run out of gas on a continous climb. For example, I try a 6c on a continously 12 degree overhanging wall about 17 m high with no real rests (indoor). I get up to about 2/3 of the wall and then just can't hold on any more. Hang on the rope for half a minute and I can climb the rest without problem. It doesn't give me that rockhard feeling in the lower forearm, I know so well from previous times.

What is happening in my muscles? Running out of energy supplies? And how could I train this to get better in this respect? 

I do bouldering twice a week and routes once. No real structure in my training, but trying to quit a session before I am worn out completely.
Bad days - how to minimize and do the best you can with them? I would assume that everyone has training days where they just don’t feel strong enough to achieve a normal workout. I feel like I’ve had a number of these sluggish 50-60% capacity days lately, even with plenty of rest. What are strategies you guys use to avoid this and when it happens how do you still get value out of the training?
Moonboarding for the average joe? So, a moonboard went up in my local gym almost a year ago. Since then, I've done maybe 8 benchmark V3s. Meanwhile, my boyfriend has progressed to benchmark V7s. I haven't progressed at all. I've struggled to improve and I can't link up the moves on any benchmark V4s. One thing I find really hard is catching a hold on row 10 from the start as I have to cut loose due to my height. 

I'm 5'6'', 54kg and female. I know the moonboard helps with power and strength so I'm really keen to progress with it. Has anyone been in this position and successfully progressed? If so, how?
So... training works! If you'd asked me two years ago "do you train for climbing?" I'd have been like "hell yeah, OBVIOUSLY I train. I'm in the gym three times a week, I built a homewall, and I have TWO hangboards. I push my limits every time I climb. I read every post on r/climbharder and listen to every episode of Power Company and Training Beta. I've progressed from Vcouch to V5 (outdoor) in five years, and I started climbing late in life!."

I genuinely thought I was near my training limit and at risk of over training. But I was starting to get frustrated that I wasn't seeing progress in terms of grades. 

Turns out, I wasn't actually training at all. I had a homewall I never used. I had two hangboards that I fucked around on once every three weeks. I went to the gym or crag and flailed around with no strategy.

I was basically lying to myself about my dedication to getting better. I didn't realize that I was holding on so tightly to a few erroneous beliefs:

I believed that real training (e.g. a hangboard protocol) was too complex to be useful for a "normal guy" like me. I assumed I couldn't train until I got my diet fixed, or until my kids weren't waking me up three times each night. I believed that real training was too difficult (i.e. the feeling of "wow this is fucking hard!" while doing it), and that if something felt really really hard that meant I wasn't ready for it. I never wanted to do core because doing core hurts.

So a about five weeks ago I dedicated myself to an extremely simple training plan, adding three elements on top of my normal "just climbing" routine. I promised myself to stick to the plan no matter what, with no adjustments for at least three months. I told myself to trust the experts.

1. Two days a week I spend half of my "just climbing" time on the moonboard, trying to send as many new benchmarks as I can. V3s felt impossible at first. I have a bunch of v4s and two v5s now. 
2. Four days a week I do an absurdly simple core workout. Three sets of five ab rollouts using hanging rings or trx, three sets of five knee/toe to bars, and two sets of push ups to failure. It takes like 15 minutes (because I still don't rest enough between sets). 
3. Twice a week I do just 6 reps of 10 second max hangs on a 13mm edge, adding weight as I can. I'm up to 50lbs. I track it in Crimpd. It takes 20 minutes including setup. 

All of these things used to terrify me. I thought "I can't moonboard, that thing is way too hard. It's for pros." I thought "if I hangboard I'll get injured." I thought "doing core fucking sucks and my core's fine from just climbing." It wasn't. 

All three of these interventions have turned out to be waaaaay easier and less complicated than I allowed myself to imagine before starting. I had been caught in this weird doublethink of both "hangboarding is too hard" and "this max hang protocol looks too simple; surely it won't work."

And my climbing has fucking EXPLODED!

I've gained a grade and a half of onsight ability at my gym since starting five weeks ago. I'm flashing problems that my formerly same-level gym buddies struggle on for multiple sessions. I can actually kinda moonboard now. 



TL;DR: check your assumptions and, especially if you've never actually trained before, just stick with something. Cut through your own BS and just TRAIN! And trust the experts. Max hangs work. Doing core stability exercises consistently works. It all fucking works if you actually do it, and it makes "just climbing" way more fun when you get better at it. 

And thanks to everyone who posts here on r/climbharder. All your advice somehow lodged itself in my subconscious and eventually came to fruition. You da real MVPs.
If you had to suggest a single book that helped you improve your climbing the most, what would you recommend? I am looking for a great book to apply to my climbing. I have never read any book for climbing and feel like I have a lot to learn. I have been climbing for a little over a year. I climb around a V5 indoor level, V3 outdoor level. I love climbing but feel my efforts are not being put to the most effective use. I am not consistent with training and my sessions are usually just random climbs without structure. I want to improve beyond where I am. 

What book would you recommend to someone like me?
Thanks to all your advice about a month ago, I FINALLY put down my most obsessive project, The Dali V8. I'm so appreciative you took the time to really help with the dyno, this go felt super solid. I dabbed by scooping a pad but I don't care.
The Rock Warrior’s Takeaways For those that have read The Rock Warrior’s Way, what aspects of it do you think about or recognize regularly when you climb?

I picked up the book to help with fear of falling, but found that my biggest takeaways were how to approach challenging yourself and staying in the moment.

Like all books there are a lot of words that go in and out, but so far since reading I find myself repeating phrases like “embrace the challenge” and breathing very purposefully whenever ego-driven thoughts pop up.

What other lines or ideas do you guys use on a day to day basis?
How to train for first Hueco Trip in January? Hi All,

I've been dedicated to training and really pushing myself for the past year or so, and am happy to have put together plans for my first Hueco trip sometime in January. I've been on the routine of mainly focusing on working my finger strength as that was by far my limiting factor. I'm a new dad, so my outside time has been limited , but in past years I've been able to put down v8 and the occasional v9, mostly in the gunks, sans any real training. B/c my outside time is so limited I'm trying to set a goal for this trip of my first v10 and am trying to plan out how to use the months before in the best way possible. 

Any recommendations on what to focus on for a Hueco trip? I'm on the bigger end of climbers, 6'1'' 180-185ish lbs, so I tend to be a more powerful climber, i.e. big pinch moves, deadpoints, core intense moves on bigger holds, etc, that come very naturally to me. In addition to hangboarding I've been spending a lot of time on the tension board (which I'm also curious if its a good metric for my outside climbing ability), and there my style makes a huge difference. Can flash into the v8 and occasionally send v9, project v10, on big power pinch/sloper based climbs, but tend to struggle more on the tic-tack crimp style, with my flash range being around v7. Would continuing to work my weaknesses on the tension board be a good way to maximize my ability come my trip and fit the hueco style?

Thanks for the help,

 \- Mike
Stronger on one-arm deadhang vs regular 2hands deadhang Hey everyone,

I'll make quick points just to make it faster/easier so I dont waste too much of your time :

Bodyweight : 195lbs/88,6kg
One-arm deadhang on 18mm for 10seconds : -35lbs/-15,9kg (with pulley system)
2 hands deadhang : +60lbs/+27,3kg

According to this, if we dont consider anything but finger flexor strength, Since I can one arm deadhang with 160lbs/72,3kg, I should be able to 2hands deadhang with 320lbs/144,6kg but I can only hang with 255lbs/115,9kg. 
What would explain this huge difference according to your experience ? 

P.s. I tested my pulley system with a tindeq and my phone just to see if there were alot of friction and there wasnt (maybe like ~2lbs/1kg at most)
Reel Rock: Age of Ondra Series Hello everyone,

I just saw the piece about Adam Ondra that has been done for Reel Rock. I don't think there is any film that provides more comprehensive insight to Ondras approach to climbing. It's split into three parts, over one hour long and watchable for free on Youtube.

Highly recommend it!

Breaking the cycle of tendon injuries Hi! I know that this has been discussed much, but while I have read up on the subject, I feel that the knee-jerk advice of just climb till the tendons get stronger doesn't cut it.

I've climbed for around 5 years and at my peak bouldered around V8 and lead 7c/13a. During the five years it's been a constant cycle of getting stronger and then partially tearing a pulley. 

Now I had a gap of around a year and coming back to climbing I find that any crimping whatsoever (say for example easier stuff around V4 on the moonboard) tends to make my finger joints and pulleys ache. This in turn makes me really concerned.

I'm looking for advice on how to specifically strengthen my tendons. I started with circuit climbing and endurance training but have been wondering if I should also include hangboarding routines? Has anyone successfully overcome the feeling of being seriously held back by the lack of tendon/pulley strength?

Thanks in advance!
What is the purpose of a cool down after boulder training and what is the danger if I skip it? I have a very fixed amount of time that I can be in the gym each week 3 x 2-hour sessions. 

I pretty much work hard till I have to leave and I skip the cool down phase in  the recommended training plan to save a bit of time. 

Is this a terrible idea? If so, why. 

Thanks!
Technique improvement for more advanced climbers. That's probably a topic that's going to be interesting for a lot of people here!
As we all know climbing is a sport that requires a lot of technique. For beginners it's nice to work on their foot placement and some drop knee, flag and etc, but as i'm climbing from almost 3 years i can say that i'm good in those beginner things, but still want to improve my climbing. How it's done? All the YouTube videos are for beginners and i know all the things said there. Probably a climbing coach is the best thing, but i can't afford it. Tell me how you stepped your climbing skill on the next level.
Bouldering Travel For people who go on bouldering trips, how do you travel with your crashpads?  Can you check them in?  Do you just rent them at your trip location?  Is there a pad share market? (Maybe, we should make an app for this?)
Climbing at your limit and (not) getting injured. Keeping good form. As the title says, I seem to pick up injuries when truly pushing forward in the grades. This seems to happen to quite a few other climbers. My theory is that if you really push your limit, some part of you is not strong enough to climb in good form.

You might be chicken winging, your shoulders come out, your wrists can't take the strain, your core can't keep the tension and/or you start slapping for holds as there is no way to do it more statically and you end up jumping for holds shockloading your tendons and ligaments. The list goes on.

So when you compare to pros climbing at their limit, they do seem to hold form and climb with good technique even when trying their max.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I manage to do that? What's your take on this?
Another analysis of the Climbharder Survey V3 Hey r/climbharder! Wanted to let you all know I did another analysis of the [climbharder training survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/5qszhe/climbharder_training_survey/). Thanks to u/higiff and all of you for completing it. You can find the results [here](https://medium.com/@dbaranger/correlates-of-rock-climbing-ability-89a16a6f2019) and [here](https://davidbaranger.com/2019/10/14/correlates-of-rock-climbing-ability/). I would love any feedback or suggestions!

TLDR of the blog post:  

In order of importance, good climbers are more likely to:

1. Have more experience
2. Be strong for their size and weight
3. Climb frequently
4. Climb outdoors and indoors
5. Train using the campus and hang board
6. Spend *less* time training their legs and doing cardio

This is largely common knowledge, not exactly a break through. I was more interested to learn about things that don’t matter (are not significant predictors in the regression models):

1. Sex (in of itself) doesn’t determine how good a climber you can be
2. Any body (tall or short, big or small) can be good at climbing
3. Ape-index probably isn’t important (though it can be fun!)
Credit card crimps Yesterday I started projecting an indoor 5.12b, my first time hopping on anything of the grade. Towards the top, the crimps turned into what I guess you’d call credit card crimps, just tiny edges. I couldn’t seem to move through them.

Understanding “bad” holds is mostly still a matter of finding the best feet and body position to take pressure off your hands, and wanting to avoid the less-than-helpful advice of “just get stronger” I hear around the gym, my question is how do you guys grab those tiny edge crimps?

Half crimp, full? Curl my fingers down so my first knuckle presses against the wall?
Things I Learned As a "New" Climber **I do not hold myself in any high esteem nor think that anything I have done is that impressive. I am offering lessons and observations of others from my own experience as a new, but analytic climber with a background in other sports and a general analysis paralysis of how to improve through the early years and lower grades. I am not going to cover hot topics like hangboarding, weightlifting, finger strength, etc. because that is just the wrong focus**

Me: Started climbing at age 32. Currently 6'3" and 162-163lbs, been as light as 130 and heavy as 248. Married, no children. Weightlifted, wrestled, and did some MMA from age 17-20. At age 20 focused on powerlifting until age 23 and hit 700/425/605 at ~230lbs. From age 23-32 lost most of my weight and got down to 148-160 and raced road and mountain bikes.

Started climbing on 4/27/2017 and prior to that had top roped occasionally with my wife. First session bouldering managed to climb every V4 in the gym and a few 5's. First outdoor session was smartly in 80 degree weather on 6/05/2017 and managed a local V4 and a bunch of stuff below it. Since then I have climbed 5.12B, onsighted 5.11c, done 3 V8's, 17 V7's, 40 V6's including 2 onsights and 6 flashes (all likely very, very soft), and so far just over 200 V4+ problems. I tend to climb about the same in the gym.

**Climbing age isn’t a number, it is a set of applied skills and state of mind**

I have a friend that is convinced they’re not a new climber just because they’ve climbed for a few years.  In reality their technique and strengths are limited as is their ability to consistently and measurably improve movement, beta, strength and tactics.  In that vein someone could climb for 10 years and be pretty new.

New is a stupid term once you get past the basics and even climbing age is foolish. Sure, age generally brings along strength and experience, but it mostly fools people into being overly confident and unwilling to consider alternate perspectives, advice, and methods and quite frankly your improvement is limited without honest reflection.

When I hit the 2 year mark I thought “I’ve done pretty well and climbed a lot I know a lot about training” and then realized that I still can’t figure out skin care, suck at backflags, have terrible gastons, don’t really know my optimal outdoor conditions range, often do not refine my beta enough between burns, don’t have a solid idea of how many snacks or meals I should bring out for the day.  Why? Because no one does!  Most people are learning almost indefinitely. That’s one facet of climbing that keeps me excited! If I wanted to just “get good” and improve numbers I would still be powerlifting.

Whether or not your age falls into the “young”, “middle” or “old” category is of course subjective. I can’t prescribe a criteria for each bin, but I would argue that some level of outdoor proficiency across styles within a discipline is a good marker. You could add indoor climbing into this as well depending on ability to get outside.  Generally speaking if you’re not consistently able to send a grade that is typically considered a matter of skill, technique, and experience or your multipitch skills turn 4 pitches into a full day- you’re still pretty damn new and can improve in every area imagineable. And still probably be new.  There’s no shame in this either because being new is the most exciting part of climbing in which almost anything you can do will lead to consistent, lasting improvement. Do you really want to be old and burned out trying to eek out 1 move on a 5 season project? Or mega stoked any time you go to a crag and fire off a classic climb or new grade?

**Every time you think you need to add something to your program, remove something instead**

The one thing I have noticed in almost every novice in any sport is they always think there is something they are not doing that is the key to success, when in reality they are likely doing too many things not well enough and would benefit from an increase in focus and quality of execution. This is honestly why I first hired Lattice as coaches. There were so many prescriptions that it was baffling.  I noticed that the best climbers I knew (that actually trained) had fairly simple, but incredibly focused programs.  But _how_ do you know what to choose from?  The easiest choice is just not making one and not adding anything.

Most arrived at them through trial and error I thought, but in reality the one parallel theme I got was that **elite climbers never added anything until they had perfected what they were already doing**.  Sure, some of these people have been climbing a long time, but when you talk to them most of the people climbing V13 or something have spent YEARS moving up a grade or bagging a hard project. Novices like to chalk this up to excuses like "genetics" or "they've been doing it forever", but the fact of the matter is that these climbers have kept things simple and maximized before moving on. Even when you read about pros training in a laser focused manner for a project or comps it is relatively simple compared to many of the programs you see on here or sold from coaches.

When I started with Lattice I was surprised at how little they prescribed me. I don't need to post my entire program on here, but I went from 3-4 sessions of ~2hrs climbing plus bench press, hangs, pull ups, core, this and that, to 1-1.5hr sessions, hangs, and 3 off wall movements. What this did was make me focus on the time I did have and treat every single thing I did with maximal focus. If you only get 4 things it is much easier to focus on those 4 things well.  When you have 8 things you stretch your focus and physical bandwidth very thin.

Also, have you noticed how many pretty solid climbers focus entirely on the Moonboard, limit bouldering, hangboard, and maybe campus board?  Sometimes they do some power endurance work. They naturally gravitate towards the most specific methods, simple prescriptions, and high ROI. I don’t know how many local crushers I’ve talked to that spend most of their year working on gym projects, maybe doing some board climbing, and just climbing a lot outside and reserve the focused programs for when they have a specific trip or project. It doesn’t work because they’re good, it works because they spend a lot of time trying new, hard shit and improve their technique, strength, and repertoire _consistently_.

**You aren’t plateau’ed, you just haven’t figured out how to climb better yet.**

Grades encompass a wide range of climbing. You could climb V6 for a few years and never be truly proficient at a wide range of V6 climbing. Unless you only go to 1 small crag or 1 small gym where nothing changes it is almost impossible to truly hit a plateau. Hitting one would mean that you could do every style on almost any given day, but not be able to do a single thing the grade above. This is virtually impossible, even in the gym. Setting can vary so much from set to set that one set is super hard, the next easy, and so forth and you are actually micro-improving each time and just are missing the big picture.

Even pros have style limits except for a few of the freaks.  If you pay attention to their sends, they are often pushing style boundaries, not grade boundaries. The movement and nuance changes, not the number. Would you consider them plateau’ed? No, climbing evolves at a microscopic scale 99% of the time.

Telling yourself you’re at a limit that requires dramatic courses of action is a great way to get caught up in bullshit.  You almost never hear of someone ask for 1 piece of technique advice to “break a plateau”, they want a complex program or set of instructions to completely revolutionize their climbing in an extremely short amount of time. 

I faced this myself this Spring after spending almost a year following a very structured, focused training plan. I was really fit, strong fingers, everything was there, but I couldn’t really break into the V8 grade or do quite as many 7’s.  Compared to past instances of really feeling frustrated with a current ceiling I decided not to search for a panacea, but to change my mindset in one way: focus on the qualitative not on the quantitative. Instead of worrying if something was V5 or V8 I chose problems because of their movement, setting, or how fun they looked. When I repeated things I noted how they felt, where my limbs were in space, and how efficient this was. 

This worked, but didn’t speed up how fast I actually improved or sent new things.  In reality I stopped focusing on this ceiling that didn’t exist and more on the breadth of the climbing experience. Shifting focus on what I wanted to improve actually fomented more improvement. For others this might actually mean doing more structured, quantified training, but the end lesson is that you are always improving and always have the potential to identify improvement if you are looking in the “right” places. Those “right” places are not static and always shifting and if there is one parallel in pros or great climbers is that they are often able to continuously shift between laser sharp foci and the big picture.

**You don’t know what you’re good at, just what you are not bad at**

I don’t know how many times I have heard newer and/or lower grade climbers claim something is “their style” or they’re “good at”.  In the gym this seems to especially happen when vertical or near vertical problems OR things with a single big move are involved. I hear so many people claim that they’re:

* Good at crimping when in reality they mean they overgrip crimps in the gym when there is good feet and they can stay square.
* Are strong in the shoulders, lats, whatever, when they actually mean that holds are good enough that they can resist the tension created by sub-par movement quality.
* A dynamic climber when that only applies to positive gym holds with good feet to launch from.
* A dynamic climber when they’re just short and use higher feet than normal.
* Good at slab when they mean when it contains massive feet that would never actually appear on a slab.

And conversely that they’re lacking:

* Endurance, when their movement efficiency is just low. This is the number 1 thing I have observed in myself and others on a rope especially when there is no actual aerobic capacity test data to back this up.
* Endurance, when they suck at resting on a rope or even on a boulder problem. It is clear as day when a climber climbs a lot outside as they actually rest mid problem and mid route when it is available and makes sense. You can replace endurance with “power endurance” even since that is often another excuse for bad form and poor tactics.
* Finger strength seems to be the number 1 thing I have seen blamed for almost everything, but in the gym have rarely seen a hold that takes much finger strength as opposed to positioning and body tension.
* Bad at overhangs. Yup, that’s because the line for pass/fail is often more finite and dependent on technique.

I thought I knew what I was good at for a long time until I actually started building and analyzing my bouldering pyramid. I was surprised that as my pyramid improved my strengths were things I never really new existed and vice versa. I was not great at compression in the gym, dynamic moves in the gym, and had good finger strength so I thought I was a tech vert master. I’m not bad at that type of climbing, but most of my best sends outdoors involved things I never would have considered myself proficient at. Some of this comes with outdoor experience, but for the most part I think people get too oriented around a specific hold, move, or most likely just gravitate to the same features and types of problems that are typically of their most consistent max grade and think that that’s “their style”.

Moreover this is exacerbated by the fact that many newer climbers seem touchy about the quality of their movement and beta and almost never repeat limit climbs inside or out and, if they do, do so with the same beta. That leads me to:

_____
**Just because something “worked”, doesn’t mean it was effective**

This applies to everything from training to beta. Most often I see this with beta on submaximal climbs. The margin of error is large, a hold could be good or your position on it solid, and something works. Without some kind of feedback you assume it was successful and move on. The same could go for a specific off wall movement, hangboard protocol, whatever.

Causality is tough even when you have lots of data and can control/account for the entire causal graph. If you meet any older/seasoned high level climber they always have something that “works” for them.  Unfortunately “works” can mean anything from “didn’t injure me” or “didn’t prevent me from improving naturally” to “the one thing that gave me that last 1%.  In addition, I have noticed that many climbers have employed so few methods that saying 1 out of 3 things worked better than the other 2 isn’t a very strong burden of proof.  Lastly, you could have been doing something that was completely overkill for 4 weeks, switched methods/got lazy, and avoided the likely impending doom that would have occurred in week 5 or 6.

In addition, I have spent a lot of time simply asking people that I consider methodical or good climbers what they do and often found that there are a few commonalities they all have in their training and climbing and the rest is just filler that enable them to optimize:

1.  Time spent outdoors climbing
2. Time spent outdoors actually topping things out (and not just constantly projecting)
3. Willingness to go deep when it counts (on a project or hard climb) and keep some in the tank to do so in the near future
4. An intense focus on the few details that count and being able to measure progress beyond metrics such as finger strength or number of pull-ups.  This doesn’t mean metrics do not help, but there is a time and a place for them and it’s reserved for testing and analysis.

I mention these 4 points because none of them are just a thing you can do X of to get Y result. It’s the only way to honestly evaluate if something works, but there are so many variables that you never truly “know”.  I was talking to V14 boulderer about finger strength and he noted that his best sends actually have come from when his finger strength was so-so. He found that the hang numbers don’t matter as much as just doing them consistently and he’s never really stuck with a specific protocol and just makes them up depending on what his project needs.  What he referred to instead was the 4 bullets above enabling him to actually apply all of his strengths in ideal conditions with adequate beta and rest.  Just because he sent doesn’t mean that it was because of the hang program or moonboard, it was more because of keeping focus on what mattered and making sure that the rest didn’t prevent it.

So many posts on here want to know what is the best way to improve X, or how to get better at Y by my trip in 3 weeks. Even if we can prescribe the optimal protocol, we won’t know if it works unless everything else is all lined up.  For me focusing on the 4 bullets above mattered more than anything else I have done mid-week. Even if I never send my indoor project or hangs only improve by the margin of error, focusing on _outcomes_ and effects is a better use of time than on how _inputs_ _affect_.

**You're doing too much and the quality and focus are lacking**

I talked to a few climbers last week who climb almost as hard as me in the gym, but barely scrape v3-4 outside. They were complaining about grade deltas when one of them noted it was his 5th day on. I'm not young, but people are constantly surprised at how "little" I do or many pretty good climbers actually do. Reducing volume and resting more is the number 1 piece of advice on this forum, yet few want to follow or believe it.

It's pretty simple- if your available time is finite and your improvement rate is a flat line, then how you're using that time is not optimal. I could probably go to the gym 5-6 days a week and just throw myself at a few gym climbs with nice, friendly holds and get a total of 60 seconds of real try hard, but I wouldn't be doing anything with purpose. I could improve just by sheer volume and luck, but the rate of improvement per time on the wall would be atrocious.

From observation and study of climbing programming, the best climbers and programs all seem to be the opposite- extremely high purpose and very little fluff.  Most programs succeed because they strip some of the fluff and replace it with some purpose.

Your injuries could also be from this. Do you really need 5 off the wall movements? Or in reality are you doing hundreds of the same movement every week with half being suboptimal due to fatigue? For every hard crimp ladder how often do you include a sidepull, gaston, or some compression? What do you think pushups will do that these things won’t?  

**It’s easy to get carried away with gym climbing.** The holds are nice, feet are obvious, and you can just stand there and throw yourself at shit until you can’t move. Skin almost never limits your and conditions are almost always primo.  But that’s what is causing most of your problems. The best antagonist training you can do is simply cutting down on the stuff that is really easy to overdo.

Anyone that has spent a decent amount of time climbing outside knows how much less volume you get in per hour spent climbing, but how much harder and higher quality the volume can be. If you applied this same ratio and average quality to the gym, what would things look like for you?

_____
**There is no ideal climbing diet and stop blaming your morphology for fundamental problems**

I think the most ridiculous thing I saw in my first year of climbing was a kinda chubby dude at Red Rock absolutely smashing every 5.11 and 12 with almost no rest. I think he probably did 20 routes that day while enjoying send beers and pork rinds. I don’t know his story, but I could observe that he had pretty damn good technique and appeared to just be super stoked.  At the time I was still figuring out the nuances of a diet that worked well for me, but even if I had known what that was it wouldn’t have mattered.

If BMI and height/weight data has taught us anything it is that the range of what is acceptable is frigging large. I know climbers with BMI’s of 17 and others with 23+.  Fred Nicole is 23.5 and the Huber brothers have done almost everything you can think of on a rope (to a degree) with never really being that lean. And then others are the opposite and accomplish a lot.

Unless you have serious issues with energy, generally eat like shit, or are suffering from poor diet quality it is unlikely that focusing so much on diet is going to have strong returns. Find something that is sustainable and allows you to coast over time hopefully avoiding having to do much to keep within a few lbs or kgs of a good send weight.  Too much focus will probably hold you back and in the age of IG food shots it’s easy to think that there is just a way to eat yourself into amazing shape. The leanest, most fit pros are fundamentally normal people that practice some form of moderation, enjoyment, and save the mental energy for climbing.

As for morphology for everything you think your morphology limits it also enables something else. There seems to be a pretty clear “zone” for pros, but you’re not pro. Blaming is a bad mindset, thinking of how to get around a limitation is much healthier. You don’t hear pros say “I could have sent except my long legs make me bad at high steps” you hear them say “I had to find an alternate foot to avoid doing as high of a step”. I am really tall, which is sick for skipping moves or climbing aretes, but it also sucks for a lot of really overhung problems or sit starts. **The most helpful thing I did was change my mindset from my limitations to searching for ways to get around them instead.**
_____
**Your technique is likely your number 1 limiter and will be for a long time**

People get really touchy about this and I don't know why. I was very lucky to understand some of climbing movement early on, but still think this is the area I have the most to learn.  Even really experienced climbers I have met still consider it an area of improvement that really never ends.  When I hear lower grade or newer climbers complain about not being strong or, and this is my favorite excuse, not having "endurance", what they almost always really mean is "my movement is not focused or efficient enough". I was lucky to once be able to do a max moves test on a Lattice board, but also had the Lattice hang tests. I was moving way below my aerobic capacity numbers, and a simple switch in my drop knee and flagging actually brought my efficiency right up to my physical limiter but it required a shit ton of focus.

For whatever reason a lot of novice and lower grade climbers focus entirely on problem grades or how hard something feels to hold on to. They don't want to admit that they are bad at knowing _how_ to hold on. Sure, this totally matters, but one thing I have picked up myself and from better climbers is that the movement of the climb matters.  I have found this to be especially true if you want to climb outside at a level close to your indoor grade.

There are a lot of indoor climbs that I could push my grade a bit higher on due to techniques that I am already proficient in or that indoor holds lend themselves to (stemming, vertical ladders, etc), but I've purposely avoided those as they are a poor ROI for training time and won't push my movement any further. I notice a lot of people only stick to one wall angle and always point to what they did on that wall angle, but never try other walls or techniques and just never develop a rounded technique and skillset.

**Ways to address this:**

* Repeating projects or very hard problems.
* Don't just climb something for a grade. Take a minute and evaluate the beta and whether or not the feel, holds, and movement are something you need to work on. Select a range of wall angles and movement types for hard indoor climbs and try to accomplish them all. If you suck at overhangs (as I did) and V5 is super hard, climb that angle and style even if you climb V7 on the vert wall.
* Get outside as much as you can. This sounds trite, but outdoor climbing will teach you more about tension, microbeta, breathing, and precision than almost anything indoors will be. Rarely will an outdoor session be of lower quality than an indoor session.
* If you ARC, traverse, do circuits of any kid, bouldering pyramids, or anything with lots of moves, focus on every single move. Don't just climb things (more on this below), make sure every move is precise. Read up on techniques like rooting, applied body tension, and use your whole body to control a move.

The worst thing I have done myself and seen others do is sit there and flail at something with zero progress especially outdoors where skin is often a precious, finite resource. My first few months outside often involved me “working” a problem with little to no progress for dozens of burns. While this felt effective, it was the opposite. It took until last Spring to realize that sometimes it’s better to take a break and just go climb and come back to something. I was working some projects in Bishop and was really mentally torched on them and just took a few days to do random climbs of many grades as I felt like it. I met a lot of people, did some funky and honestly awkward climbing, then came back and sent my project first go. I then walked over to another boulder and cruised a former project.

What happened in this example and that I am recommending is somewhat of a movement economy reset. After a few burns you’re just losing strength, wasting skin, and likely engraining poor movement or beta. You could sit there and try new beta, which makes sense, but if progress is flat then you could do way more good than harm. If you do stay parked in front of the climb use your rest to make a plan. Stack pads and work a sequence, try new beta, rest twice as long, experiment with a different foot, stop copying Andy Liu’s YouTube beta- just do something new!
______
**Have a plan for outdoor days**

Don’t just walk to the crag with every single cool problem marked.  Identify a few potential climbs you can project, a few that you have high confidence sending/second tier projects, some classics or goofy moderates, and just shit that looks fun.  There will be a lot of days where you warm up and pull on the project and you feel tired or even bored of it. There might be others where your project is in the sun or your friend thinks they can send their project and it’s not even close.

The worst thing is making up something on the fly and why a lot of people tend to not effectively use their time outside.  My early days often involved doing far too much volume to really climb at my limit, but if I can say anything it’s that I found a lot of success in the “plan” above because I always walked away with a lot of interesting climbing.  Until your pyramid and experience level are pretty deep there is a huge risk in walking away with very few successful sequences or sends and your learning rate plummets.  If you don’t get out often you are just wasting a precious opportunity.

A helpful sequence or plan is:
Primary projects selected by what you could likely send within your time frame as well as things for the future if you can return somewhat regularly. If you get to a crag once every year or 2, I’d really limit long-term projects.
Second tier projects that you could likely send within the trip or possibly a session. These might include classics, obscurities, things your group all wants to do together.
Primary volume. Climbs below your limit that can be sent in a session or ideally in a few tries so you can to multiple per day. Ideally there would be multiple styles, cruxes, and a mix of both classics and novel/interesting stuff.
Secondary volume. This is where old projects, stuff way below your limit that still climbs well. One off climbs that are just barely good enough to burn skin on. Funky eliminates, dumb traverses, goofball classics suchs as Buttermilk Stem. You won’t burn too many repeats on these and your primary metric is how much fun you’re having.

You don’t have to do all of these in a day. You can simply do one. But having a plan avoids the scenario where you half ass a few things with no real aim or commitment and fail to accomplish much of anything. If you can do one of the 4 things above you can have a quality day regardless of conditions or how you feel. I wasted a lot of days early on either just projecting or just doing volume when I felt invincible.  It also makes it way easier to select what to climb at a big crag or spread out area and provides a sense of reward that keeps the stoke high.  Doing so can make it easier to climb with a group or others of different skill levels too!

**There is no easy switch you can flip to suddenly succeed**

Climbing is a long game sport. Even if you got to V10 in year 1, it is going to take a long time to push your current ceiling upwards.  Sure, sometimes things come in a burst and you gain enough to go from a single V8 to 20, for example, but that is still a lot of slow, accumulated processes. So many posts on here and questions from lower level climbers treat their current ceiling as a "plateau" and that there are just 1-2 things they can optimize to just burst past it. This is the wrong mindset to have about the sport because even if you flip that switch to go from V4-7, there isn't always going to be low-hanging fruit.

The best climbers I have met and most pros find joy in microscopic improvements and ebbs and flows in their progression.  Look at Dave Graham on Hypno or La Rambla- the dude tried both for years and years before getting either and was often mega stoked on a single improvement in a sequence or movement. There are probably 100's of climbing videos in which pros talk about the same small battles that they triumph to eventually send. If you don't enjoy this now, then hard climbing isn't for you.

_____
**Stop focusing so much on numbers**

Will Anglin wrote a great article on how V10 is completely arbitrary. Don't just pick climbs in a guidebook by grade or constantly talk about your gym grades. If numbers are what you want just go lift weights, that's an easy way to push numbers higher if that's your goal. Climb things that challenge you and inspire you. The worst situation you can get into is picking things for numbers, but not for inspiration or focus.

When I first started climbing my goal was to climb V6 within a year. I found a soft local climb and did it. It then took me months to do a harder V5 next to it. Which do you think did more for my climbing? Which do you think was more rewarding? Wait, was I actually all that interested in how either climbed? Yah, I quoted my numbers above, but I don't think they mean anything other than I have done some climbs.  In year 2 my goal was to climb a V8. I climbed a local turd of an 8 that I honestly don't know if I can count as one.

There are still some 6's and even a few 5's I haven't climbed either from opportunity or just because they're extremely hard for me. I think I will be more stoked to send those than many of my more "hard" accomplishments thus far.  Looking back a lot of climbs I have done were things I wouldn't go waste skin or energy on again and lots of the best accomplishments were things that just had great scenery, movement, or a very memorable shared experience with friends and other climbers. You have to have these details to truly remain stoked and appreciate climbing for what it is. Otherwise we could all just do Crossfit instead.

Don't even get me started on hangboard, pull-up, or gym climb numbers. As someone who has above average finger strength, that shit is a correlation at best and a great way to fool yourself in how you think about your potential and evaluate performance.  These numbers only matter for a very limited context and within their own scope.
_____
**Just climb is a great "program", but not what you think it means**

Novices tend to hate this advice and find it trite. They think of just climbing as wandering the gym and throwing themselves at things until their skin hurts or they have to go home.  What it really means is that a high amount of focus is on what they climb, how they climb it, and how they focus on the qualitative aspects of the experience. If you pick the right problems (this might mean setting your own), mix your intensity levels, and keep your volume conservative, the ROI on every second you're in the gym skyrockets. You are doing the most sport specific type of training possible while improving myriad physical and movement aspects of your climbing.

What can you possibly do off wall that is any better? Why do you need pull-ups, rings, or hangboarding if you can simply work on compression, long moves, gastons, body tension, and holding the smallest hold you can for just that much longer?

Chances are "just climbing" hasn't worked for you because of many of the things I mention in this post. You go to the gym and throw yourself at a climb because of a number and you record the send for IG, but you aren't picking climbs to learn from and evaluating your send footy so that you can fix form and repeat it. You climb on the same walls all the time and brag about how easy a V7 was, but you don't walk around the gym and pick climbs for their purpose. You use fatigue and powering down as a barometer of session success and almost never stop when performance degrades or you have accomplished a meaningful goal. Your mind wants to maximize v-points or some other arbitrary bullshit, not the quality of the v-points. You rarely think of a session as focused on a couple of technique goals and more on the shape of the holds or whatever your friend thinks is cool.

____
**This doesn't mean never train or never organize your climbing**

Clearly I have spent a lot of time training. I've done a lot of things and don't want to be a hypocrite about the idea of approaching climbing time with clarity, parameters, objectives, and goals.  I think the biggest take home I have is that the complexity of such can be a distraction, stressor, and blocker. Training will likely push your physical and mental limits to new places, many of which are not necessarily "fun" and have a greater recovery cost. The more things you do and the more complex the program, the more risk you assume and chance of getting in your own way.  The last thing you want to do is limit your mental and physical bandwidth for learning be it on the wall or outdoors.

After removing fluff as noted above, adding things in is a paralyzing process.  There are a billion protocols to choose from so which do you choose?  First and foremost find a benchmark you can repeat often to assess. It can range from Lattice tests to a Moonboard problem or even a local outdoor climb. If you have benchmarks that can include technique or multiple styles, then great.  I have found that ~4 off wall movements (not including finger training) and generally ~20min 2x/week is a really great starting point that can carry you a long way for a long time. Whether or not you add hangboarding is something I do not want to touch with a 100 foot pole, but if you do start simple and give things 6-8 weeks.

Don't make all of your movements address the same "weak spot". That's a good way to skew things in the opposite manner. Select a loading scheme that is ~90% of what a non-climber would do so you have room to scale up.  Be consistent about whatever you choose whether you tack it on to the end of a session, at work, or at home. Start with things that have the lowest recovery impact. This is what any coach or experienced climber will recommend and have you scale up from. The difference between you and them is that they have a non-biased framework for feedback and measurement. You need to form this framework over time and the more you do, the harder this will be.  The Andersons didn't arrive at RCTM in 1 go- it took a decade to create the framework and they had far more knowledge going into it than you have.

The biggest mistake I see and have done myself is doing way too much to address a weak spot. When aerobic capacity was deemed a weakness by Lattice I was doing 1-2 workout(s) a week for it with 24-30min of total targeted climbing. I was recently speaking to a friend who was doing 30-40min per session twice a week plus systems training for plus TRX work plus hangboarding plus outdoor climbing and wanted to add limit bouldering and 4x4s. This is a good way to really reduce quality and capacity. I would start with 1 workout once a week and by week 8 be doing 2 and taking something out.  **You are not going to dramatically change your climbing in 1 training cycle it can take months or years so be patient. It's better to not do enough then do too much and be at the same spot or even worse off.**

**Leave bandwidth for fun and outdoor climbing. You will need this more than you think. You can't train psych.**
____
**Limit bouldering is a bad idea because you don't know your limits**

If you think you do, you're likely full of shit or not being very honest with yourself. People that haven't climbed outside much or for very long have not been exposed to enough to know their true limits. Even if they have been adequately challenged and shut down, it's not likely because it is their physical limit, but more a technique or exposure limit.  I can say that I have pulled onto many problems and felt like there was no way I could possibly send, but later that session was topping out. Chances are your current projects are the same and you just need exposure to movement to get them. Even if you have done something similar in a controlled gym/board setting, it's not precisely the same.

True limit bouldering is 1-3 extremely hard moves that test physical limits hence the name.  You have to know what those limits are first. I was lucky enough to have a hard training board at my local gym that very high level climbers trained on. I thought I was limit bouldering by setting things that were pretty hard, but I quickly realized how true limit bouldering is an art and learned skill. The difference between my problems and theirs was that their problems were things they could attempt maybe a few times in a session at pretty good, recovered form with tons of rest. Mine were things I could do 10x more times in a session or send over a few sessions. Their movement was varied and often informed by years of climbing. Mine was just things that felt hard. They might do 20 limit moves per session, but their quality was 99%. I might do 40, but my quality was 50%. Total % wise we might be even, but overall they’re likely improving on a physical and neuromuscular level and I’m just getting sore.

Flailing at projects on the climbing wall is often not close to limit bouldering.  Stop calling it that.

Given that, it's unlikely that you have enough background to get in an appreciable amount of applicable volume. In addition, since many of the lower grades and early years revolve around technique, maximal limit strength isn't your blocker- linking fairly hard moves efficiently and precisely is.  You think you're bad at something because it was hard, but you've only done it a handful of times. You were bad at the yellow problem with crimps so you yard to crimps when in reality it was hard because the hold orientation and sequence pushed you to and beyond your limits for that specific sequence.

A better idea is to try and progress on a problem or sequence. Don’t spend the entire session on one hard problem either. If you don’t send in ~30min move on and have 2-4 problems to work on in a session. If you don’t make any progress even in the first few burns try a different link or move on. It helps to consistently make progress.  Don’t always go from the start either especially if it’s just easy moves. Learn to link sequences and sections and refine your beta over a session or multiple sessions. These skills will translate well to projecting outside and the difficulty will be hard enough to get strength and technique improvements.

**Get a hangboard at home**

Even if you just use it occasionally to test or you don’t hangboard often, a good hangboard with jugs allows you to fit in finger training separate from climbing and makes one less trip to the gym. By the time you need to use it you will have easy access and can squeeze in quality while you cook dinner or watch TV. Bonus points if you get some rings.

My logic is actually quite simple- the more time you take away from being on the wall, the more you limit potential for improvement. If you go the gym, warm up, then do max hangs, then climb, sometimes your warm up and hangs might take a full hour and you’re left with little time to climb.  I have found that a hangboard at home means I can wake up, make coffee, slowly warm up on the big holds, get my stuff together, and I can either skip my gym warmup or do my hangs at home.  Or, I leave a bit in the tank and come home and do the same before dinner.

The reason why I advocate for this isn’t because every needs to hangboard, it’s because this will have a subconscious effect on your decision-making. You won’t push hanging too hard if you have a workout planned that will be impacted negatively by it. You’re unlikely to want to overclimb if you want to do your hangs later. Most importantly it keeps the gym the place that you _climb_
Mental Gains I’ve heard so many pro-climbers talk about the mental aspect of climbing. Like, “you gotta believe you can do it” kinda speeches, but I don’t think I’ve ever fully grasped that ideology in my own head. 

I haven’t been climbing for any impressive amount of time. I’d say about three years and more obsessively in the past year and a half. My main source of training is bouldering indoors. I’ll switch gears and TR/lead throughout my sessions if a friend shows up at the gym. Even then, I usually just try to flash anything below 5.12a, not really looking to start a project. I’ll go on climbing trips with friends but most are still in college and have limited time/resources to go somewhere. Regrettably, I only get to go on a handful of climbing trips every year. :(

Recently though, I’ve been at a plateau as a solid V5 boulderer. I can give good attempts on anything below V9 if the holds aren’t absolutely horrendous. There’s been a couple V6 and V7s that I got soooooooo close on but couldn’t do it before the reset. BUT! Yesterday, I got my first V6! It was a pretty technical slab problem that had with some good, some not-so-good pinches and a strong, big-move finish. I was so hyped that I left the gym because I wanted that session to end on a good note haha. And today, I got another V6 which was the complete opposite style. Long roof problem with big moves at the bottom and small pumpy one pad jugs toward the top. I’ve been feeling super strong and confident lately, and I think I know why...

I’ve made some mental gains! Getting that first V6 triggered something in my mind. It gave me the right boost of self-confidence that I needed to send that second V6 the day after. I know that the grades are just numbers, but I think a part of me was still conscious of the grade and that caused a mental block. Or maybe those V6s just happen to both be soft. I don’t really know. But, I feel strong and hopefully I can get some more V6s and eventually a V7 soon! 

TLDR: was plateauing at V5s and broke that plateau yesterday. That first V6 cleared my mental slate and I got another V6 today. 

I’m curious if anyone has developed any sort of mental training exercises? Do any of you have good visualization tips or strong mental endurance tips for when you are climbing your projects?

PS: thanks for reading, I just have the urge to share this news.
I Hurt index finger at work, and would like to continue hangboarding without it while it heals. Any advice on positioning or different ways I could pull to reduce strain or damage to my other fingers? Any advice would be helpful thank you! [deleted]
Will I ever be injury free ? So back story, 6 months ago I was at the peak of my climbing. I wanted to do my first 8A boulder had tried a few that seemed doable, had topped a couple of 7C+ recently, was training consistently and really felt great... Except for injuries all over... And I really do mean all over. The usual pulley strains, of course, but also some odd knee flexor pain that felt terrible when heel hooking or toeing in from the side, shoulder impingement, and once in a while I'd get the early signs of tendonitis in my forearms... My wife was expecting for 3 months later, I figured I wouldn't top my 8A any time soon and decided to just forget about it and move on. I figured it'd be better to have this still on my to-do list for later, instead of going harder for the last 2 months and get an injury I would have to recover from while having all the new dad responsibilities.

The baby was born, the body healed and the dad went back to the climbing gym... First few weeks were alright, quickly I was back in the 7A color grade while I was in the 7C one before and after a bit short of 2 months of being back... And it started all over again : the fingers, it's not the pulleys, but I can feel some kind of synovitis, some of my fingers feel weird when I twist or bend them on the side. 2 of my pulleys feel fragile, not pain yet, but it's clearly an early sign I've come to know quite well.

What sucks though is that I'm not training anymore, I'm not even really trying hard, and I'm not at even half the volume I was before, and 2 full grade below my old level... Will I ever be injury free ? I thought all my injuries came from the volume or the intensity and figured I was just bad at knowing when to stop and not doing enough prehab for the intensity of the work I was doing... But now I'm climbing twice a week, for 2 hours warmup included... If I go lower than that I won't need climbing shoes to be honest...

I guess this is more of a rant than anything, or maybe it's me coming to terms with the idea that not only I won't top my 8A, but I probably won't ever be in the 7 range for long if I'm not willing to have random pains and aches all around my body... Might as well not climb I guess... Anyway, sorry for the long post, TL;DR I'm injured all the time, even when I'm not trying to climb hard and it sucks...
Need some advice for how to train better ("just climb" is not working) Hi,

I've been climbing for around 5-6 years (mainly bouldering), the last couple of years around 2-3 times a week. I've also been stuck on V2-V3 for this period. I don't have a very structured program I follow, so I hope I might be able to advance if I start being more strict when I boulder.  


What I normally do is a warm up where I traverse and focus on excercises like silent feet, hips to the wall, etc. I then climb easier stuff V0-V1 while focusing on technique (trying to climb them perfectly, being aware of how I move my body, feet, hands, where my COG is, etc). I then move on to stuff at my limit. Meaning I will spend most of my time on problems that I cannot climb. Some times I flash them, if so I move on. Sometimes I am able to send them after a few tries, some times I spend 7-8 tries without being able to send them. The routes I am not able to send, I work on by trying only the move where I fail (again being mindfull of my hands/feet etc, and trying different ways of doing the same move). Some times I change problems before 7 tries, if I feel like I don't have a clue about the beta, or where I cannot even start the problem without falling off. 

Other times (when I have less energy), I structure my workout  by climbing easier stuff that I can mostly flash (v0-v1) but without taking breaks (or just a short one to chalk up), and keep doing that until failure. Then take a break and repeat the process. I probably do that 4-5 times before I am beat.

I always try to visualize how to do the problem before trying, and I also spend time thinking about them when taking breaks while working on a problem.

I haven't been able do identify any particular weakness. Whether the problem is overhung or not, have small holds or not, is dynamic or not doesn't seem to make a difference. I both send and fail routes at the v2-v3 level for any combination of those properties. I \*do\* often feel that "if only I had more grip strength, I would be able to do it", but I think that might just be a symptom of poor technique (like how I use my legs/body). For this reason I climb every type of problem that I find hard.

After every workout I do some stretches, antagonistic training, hangboard and core workout. I am not very strong, but I can do maybe 8-9 pullups, hold an l-sit hang for maybe 20-30 sec and people say my grips strength should be sufficient for the grades I am climbing (and the ones I am trying to climb). I usually train for 1-2hrs and feel very tired/exhausted afterwards, so I think that means I am trying hard enough(?) I am 5.11 feet and 163 pounds.

So, this is what I have been doing, and I'm not getting better, so I want  to try to change things up a bit. Any of you have any advice? I am happy to answer more questions about my practice regime, if I missed something :)
Discussion on tendon healing: "Recurring microinjuries lead to the development of hypertrophied biologically inferior tissue replacing the intact tendon." [deleted]
This is what you need to be a better climber. The post you will read is only my opinion based on a lot of time spend digging in information how to be better, stronger and more powerful climber. You can feel free to correct me if you think I'm wrong. I hope this is going to be helpful for some of you.


A lot of us are searching for secret plans for training and some new exercises that will make us better at climbing, but there isn't something like the best hangboard protocol. There isn't a single best training regiment you can do to expand your potential. BUT i think there are principles that can make us much better. And if you are a person who climbs for a lot of time and isn't progressing like your friends you might thing that you're doing something wrong or your friends are just genetically gifted, but there is something else.

The first thing is to try hard. And by saying trying hard I don't mean spending 6 hours at the gym when your skin starts bleeding. You have to try hard when you climb, when you try the same boulder move you felt last time you have to grab the hold harder, you have to push with your legs harder, you have to engage your core just as like as you are doing those TRX exercises. If you did that this is awesome. Now you need some rest. 1-2-3-4 minutes how much you want, but you have to feel fresh and psyched for another hard try. 10 tries high quality tries are much better than 30 "just trying some stuff" tries. 

The second thing is pay attention to everything when you are climbing. How you grab the hold, where is your thumb, how you placed your foot, how much you push with your leg, should you climb the problem this way or this way. Just be present to the moment of climbing and analysis everything when you are resting, make a plan for your next try. You can also film yourself, discuss everything with friends, but when you have the knowledge about a certain move you have to concentrate and execute what you should do. 

The third and last thing is similar and connected to the previous. When you climb a hard boulder, no matter if it's inside or outside, try it again, try to do something different, even something wrong just to feel the move, to feel how your body moves. Then you will be able to understand your body and the moves you do. 

Now if you're a person who is "just climbing" and thinks that you need some hangboarding and weighted pull ups, do you changed your mind? 

"4% trying harder every workout, don't makes you 4% better climber. It makes you 90% better climber" - Dave Mcloud. 


I wish all of you hard sends and i still hope that i helped or motivated even one person here to be a better climber. I received a lot from this group and this is the way i'm trying to give everything back!
Anyone have advice for redpoint/pre-send nerves/jitters? Sorry if this isn't the appropriate sub.

I have trouble with nerves before trying to redpoint routes that I absolutely know I can send. This always makes me overgrip and climb like shit on my actual redpoint burns. Sometimes it makes me not even want to get on them, as if the satisfaction of knowing I absolutely *can* do them is enough, but it's really not. So I end up flailing on routes that I know I can do and making little progress. Anyone have any strategies to combat this?

Edit: thanks for all your comments everyone. Heading to the crag right now so we will see!

Double Edit: sent two of my three projects! thanks again everyone!
Crimping with Back 3 Fingers I just watched a video of Alex Megos climbing (https://youtu.be/N9H8gcpZhss) and was quite surprised that he is using quite a lot a Back 3 crimps...it's actually not the first time I observe this with in climbing videos, but I personnaly never tried it. I would actually always use my middle 3 fingers. Is there any specific reason to it? 
Thanks
Need to indentify me weaknesses (video in post) A couple of days ago I made this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/dj5l0q/need\_some\_advice\_for\_how\_to\_train\_better\_just/](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/dj5l0q/need_some_advice_for_how_to_train_better_just/)

TL;DR: Been climbing for 5-6 years without progressing further than v3. I want to improve but don't know how.

It was suggested that I filmed myself and upload here, so I did: [https://streamable.com/zkq5p](https://streamable.com/zkq5p)It's a mix of things I send easy, struggle with, and fail. The grades in my gym isn't on a V-scale, so I have put some approximations in the video (but I guess the grade doesn't really matter, what matters is my form and why I fail).

I am not looking for beta/tips on these exact problems, but general observations about what I need to work on (and if you are able to: tips on \*how\* I should work on that). Can you identify some general tendensies that I need to fix?

I got a lot of really good advice in the other thread, but several people said it was hard to give advice without seing me. Hopefully this will give you more to go on.

I'll answer any questions if things are unclear (there are a lot more detail in the last post).  


Thanks! You are awesome! :)
What are some examples of micro beta that totally changed the feeling of a move for you? Might seem like a trivial question, but one of my favourite things in climbing is discovering key micro beta. For example, standing up slightly higher before coming in to an undercling, or raising my heel just a little bit higher to get an inch more of reach at my fingertips. Is anybody else as nerdy as me about this??
Allergic reaction to Flashed tape?? I’ve used it for 7 years and this only started happening to me this week. The heat and itching is so bad that it wakes me up at night. Left is my elbow, the scrape I had reacted badly too. Right is one of my fingers. Anyone else have this issue??
Holding a Swing (before- During &amp; after the jump) I am the opposite of any kind of expert when it comes to dynamic climbing/ cutting loose. This post is created to gather community wisdom on "how best to cut loose when you have to cut loose". 

Below are some of my observations: 

1. cutting loose costs energy (body strength, finger strength &amp; mental focus) DUHH
2. cutting loose can be roughly categorised as intentional vs unintentional or dynamic vs static

* intentional: you know you are cutting loose and you are mentally prepared for it
* unintentional: you didn't step well or you misjudged distance and you cut after grabbing the next hold, you did not mentally prepare for the cut
* static: you stuck the next hold at full fingertip to toetip span and lack the flexibility/ hold purchase to step through to the next foothold and you decide to release fro the static position into a cut to regain foot hold
* dynamic: the next hold is beyond your span &amp; you dynamically jumped, leaving any and all footers behind. i.e. you essentially cut before you hit the next hold. 

3. good climbers avoid cutting when possible but they also know how to cut when they have to, be it intentional or not. They body understands the sensation and reacts accordingly to regain control. 

4. intentional &gt; unintentional. Static &gt; dynamic (but situation dependent)

5. being 135-90 degrees locked off in the elbows help maintain shoulder/ back stability &amp; helps with the hold

6. when cutting from a static position, release one foot first to get some weight out of the overhang. This will reduce the size of the swing

I am sure Most people here are better versed at this topic than i am. Please add to it!
Mina Leslie-Wujastyk just published an article about her health and RED-S [relative energy deficiency in sports]. Worth looking into!
Mono finger strength - which digit is strongest? (first post on Reddit ever so be kind :D)

I notice a lot of climbers default to their middle finger for mono pockets, and even read some forums wherein the general consensus seemed to be that the middle finger is the strongest, followed by ring finger, then index???!! (eg. [here](https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/107855960/which-finger-is-second-strongest)) I find this quite surprising because for me, my index fingers are *significantly* stronger than either middle or ring. I don't have the right equipment to do a controlled test, but in a half crimp position with one pad on an edge, I feel like my index can hold around twice as much weight as my middle finger. My ring finger isn't even in the same league, I can hardly put any weight on it, same with the pinky.   


I had always naturally assumed the index finger would be the strongest but now I'm hearing otherwise, am I an anomaly? And if I am just naturally stronger with the index finger, should I use that for monos or is there a benefit in conditioning myself to use the middle finger? Am I more likely to get injured using the index or something?
Training strategies for late starters Many climbers here like myself, got involved in the sport in our late 20's -40's. While most others in your gym have 5-10 years more climbing experience than you, what are some of the things you can to do to maximise your growth and potentially catch up to some of them in the near future. I have made observations over the 2 year period since I started. Below are what I have seen to work for late starters. Many of these will apply to achieving training efficiency for just about anyone but they are especially important for people trying to catch up. 

&amp;#x200B;

**General: Learning Curves &amp; what not to do:**

"When you know nothing, you have no idea how best to improve." your priority as a new climber should be to cut out the start of the learning curve as much as you can. Finding a good coach or a strong climber willing to give you pointers will help you avoid detours along your training journey. When possible, seek to understand what took others years to figure out &amp; implement them in your training as early as possible. Reference to Mina Leslie's article on RED-S, many climbers train with sub-par recovery for years without realising. Instead of spending years going through trail &amp; error, learn and apply. Some of these pearls of wisdom include obvious things like: 

\- don't get injuried

\- build a solid foundation

\- learning to use the body in a coordinated manner

Learning from others should always be an objective no matter how experienced you are. 

&amp;#x200B;

**General: Consistency** 

Be it training or recover, the only way to see result is through consistency. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Training Efficiency 1: Recovery**

Before I even mention training load, it's recovery. 

Do what is required to maximise your recovery. If you can recover from more, you can train more. If you can train more (in a smart way), you can outperform (in the long term). Some standard strategies are:

\- sleep 8 hours min (or whatever is good for your body) 

\- minimise other stresses (life, work etc.)

\- take rest days

\- actually rest on those days

\- take rest weeks (frequency depending on your split)

You need to know your body &amp; be flexible with the training. If you are not recovering, you are not improving work cap. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Training Efficiency 2: Training Load**

Training load needs to be something you can recover from. so yeah, do as much as you can every session as long as you can recover from the stimulus. Don't over train but on the other hand, don't squander your potential by flailing up 5 moderate climbs a sessions &amp; spend the most of your time patting doggos &amp; talking shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Training Efficiency 3: Programming**

I am a firm believer of periodisation here. This is more important in my opinion for boulderers vs enduro route climbers. The changes in training focus gives you room to taper rest and amp up intensity for performance phase/s. (Very much up to debate \^)

&amp;#x200B;

**Training Efficiency 4: WHAT/HOW THE HELL ARE YOU DOING**

Resonating the numerous post on how to "just climb", regardless of whether you are training on or off the wall. The training should be structured, targeted and smart. As an example, throwing yourself at jug ladders with poor technique may increase your training cap on jug to a certain extent but does not help with technique refinement or your performance on more difficult hold types. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Training Efficiency 4.1: Mentality &amp; focus**

Part of what makes your training structured, targeted and smart is how you approach your sessions mentally. Training to climb with a great level of focus will directly &amp; indirectly improve outdoor performance. Those who climb strong all have the ability to zone in on the next move. moving through a sequence with precision &amp; grace. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Training Efficiency 4.2: Return on investment**

ROI!!!!!!!!!! everyone be doing maxhang, IF &amp; board climbing but your tendons ain't closed to being seasoned for this. What does ROI mean in the context of training in the first few years? Solid foundation building is my interpretation: 

\- good footwork habits 

\- good focus/ mentality on the wall

\- ability to try hard

\- learning to pull through uncomfortable positions

There are many things outside of max hang that can give you great value. Although its progress is not as easily measured, having clean, decisive movements &amp; the ability to dig deep will get you up more boulders/ routes than pure finger strength will. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'ma tap out. Why don't you gurus add to it.
"Just Climb" = ??? (discussion on what this means) I’ve been browsing this subreddit more and more and I just wanted to discuss something that was on my mind. I’ve been seeing a lot of people with tags like “1 year” and “6 months” asking about complex things such as differences in rung size for training, how to structure an efficient and aggressive training plans, plateauing, supplements, or limit bouldering. All these questions are essentially the same question if you boil it down to the overall question: what I could be doing that I am not already doing. Being even more reductionist, a question could become something like: how do I progress even faster? 

**Why are people asking this?**

If it’s not obvious to everyone on this subreddit it’s probably something like this: person finds rock climbing, has a knack for it, discovers people who climb hard, wants to run with the buffalo, sees them training, wants to participate. 

The person then probably tries to emulate (maybe successfully) the role-models. Usually, there are no gains in doing such or the exercises seem so out of reach that they are impossible. They probably then think that something is missing and that they should do their research. Kudos to thinking this. 

They then stumble upon the world of training for climbing and think that this is a great answer. Just as bodybuilding and power lifting have websites, climbing does as well (power company, lattice, etc). These websites write interesting and easy to digest articles on how to train for climbing. Perfect! 

However, even when incorporating this into the rotation, it seems like it is still not a perfect answer and thus they begin posting here. Maybe the progression is non-existent or too slow to see gains week to week. Perhaps they are people who have trained in the gym and like being able to add 10 lbs per week to their deadlift. Obviously this is different for everyone. 

**“Just climb” and frustration**

 Often, the prescription given (correctly, imo) in this subreddit is to just climb. This is equally frustrating because it seems like people are gatekeeping or not reveling some internal esoteric training strategy that we all know and refuse to share. It also implies that there is some passivity required to continue and to avoid thinking about the sport (wrong!). 

Our climber friend generally ignores this and continues training with whatever they learned from the subreddit and what they’ve cherry picked as their plan. They being doing muscle ups and skin-the-cats while max hanging and limit bouldering. 

**Turn for the worse**

Not that this happens to everyone, but I’ve also been seeing a lot of “I cannot close my hand” and “what to do with wrist pain” type threads. I can only assume that both are inherently linked. No one who climbs at a boulder gym that is being mindful should have these problems, barring the obvious bell-curve of injuries. These, I expect, are mostly overuse injuries or acute injuries that could have been prevented by understanding what was being asked of the body. A crimp for your fingers may be like a 350 lbs deadlift for your back, scaled. 

**What “just climb” means**

Just climb is a sort of dog whistle to other climbers that have years of experience as it doesn’t really mean what it should. What it means is “just continue on your path, use patience and good judgement, you will know when things are actually starting to stall, hopefully.” In this case, what I think most people are trying to convey is the sense of patience. Be patient right now and you’ll see how this will pay off, is what it seems to mean for most people who utter it.

Others also mean to explain that there is a real difference between a strong climber and a climber that understands climbing. Depth of understanding comes through exploration. Exploration takes time.  

As rock climbing is a complex sport, it doesn’t resemble weightlifting in this sense but more so skiing, mountain biking or hockey. It may appear that way, especially with all these really complex and precise plans that are based on BW and time, percentages and goals. There is a lot of skill that needs to be built while you get stronger. There are physiological responses that take time to build. You may not like the idea of tendons taking time to build but that is just the reality of the sport. 

Furthermore, “just climb” is not just that. Don’t continue to climb while your motivation continues to deteriorate. Don’t climb impatiently, salivating at every hard climb and being upset about the hardest low grade climbs. Don’t climb and injure yourself. Don’t climb injured. Don’t climb because you need to prove something to others. Don’t climb if you don’t want to. 

The difference between weightlifting and climbing here is obvious: as weightlifting can be rapid, number driven and precise, climbing is much more complex and slow moving. 

**What you can do to “just climb” better**

I don’t mean to say stop trying. But here are some things that will help you improve.

Firstly, continue climbing as much as you can and as often as you can. Climb with people who climb hard, but don’t feel the need to try the same projects. Try their warmups and watch. Ask questions and understand the complexity. 

Second, continue being healthy. As soon as you start feeling like something is off in your hands or pain is above 3/10, stop climbing and get rest. It may feel bad to waste a week on a membership pass resting but do so and come back stronger. Getting hurt will sideline you or worse. 

Third, hire a coach if you need something that will give you an edge. Make sure it’s someone who can teach you movement and understanding and not someone that wants you to do chin ups and finger board. They may have more insight on what you will want to do going forward in terms of drills. 

Fourth, stay psyched. As the old saying goes “youth is wasted on the young,” so is psych wasted on the newer climbers. Read magazines, look at videos, learn the culture and bleed climbing. It’s fun and it should be. 

Fifth, and maybe most importantly, be patient. There will be a time when you need all the tools you’ve learned about. You will buy those climbing products one day. You’ll buy a hangboard. There is not a magic bullet here. No one rides all the drops on the first run in mountain biking. You’re not going to send your entire gym in the first year. 

Sixth, ask climbers what their story is. Knowing how long people have been climbing in general puts into perspective how amazing you probably are right now. Instead of focusing on how you can’t win the open, focus on how you’ve got some talent already and that you’re already on a good path. 

Seventh, always think. What am I doing with my body. Am I working against myself? Film yourself. Watch others. Think hard. Iterate. Try again. Try again. Try again. Try again. 

**Why should you listen to this?**

Consider two cases: one person who progresses with the just climb mentality and another who decides to throw it in the trash and just train. What does that look like? Perhaps the training person gets strong, but this influences what they end up climbing as it moves the needle towards what they happened to train (remember, it’s hard to goal set when you’re new). You end up climbing your strengths generally and in such this person starts a feedback loop / butterfly effect that may drive them to a part of the sport they may not have wanted or don’t instinctively like. Maybe the only thing they’ve learned to enjoy is how much their can overload their fingers or how many campus runs they can do.  

The just climber, however, has progress and continued things they liked all along. They’ve become better and more efficient at this. Maybe this means they’ve climbed the local style more and are now ready for harder climbs in this style. Perhaps this renews their stoke. Perhaps they’ve made connections in the community. And now they can start training with the goals that they now possess.

Obviously, this is sort of an oversimplification but maybe something to consider!
Reflections on climbing age I started climbing in 2013, age 30. Late starter, skinny-nerd body, I'll probably never reach top-tier ability regardless of training.

Since then, I've climbed off and on. 90-95% gym climbing. 90-95% bouldering. Having kids, switching jobs, etc etc resulted in months-long breaks. Rarely have I had a month where I've *consistently* climbed 2-3 times per week, and when I do manage, the sessions are only 30-60 minutes.

As a result, after the first year or so, progress has been... slow. I'd make some progress, then regress, recover to the same peak, regress, recover and progress to be slightly stronger, regress. I'm fine with that - I like climbing for its own sake, I have nothing to prove.

I've never had an injury. If I feel a tendon in the left ring-finger is painful in a certain move, I back off. That way, I can climb when circumstances allow, rather than being limited by pushing past my limits.

I'm climbing 6b/6b+, both on top rope and boulder. I think I've added a half grade somewhere in the last two years or so.

Over the last year, I feel like I've finally progressed from "beginner" to "intermediate".

I was climbing a seaside limestone cliff in Gotland, Sweden with a group of colleagues, and was the only one who brought his own shoes. When I came off the wall, the guide took a break and said, "I don't mean to denigrate anybody else's abilities here, but let me just say it's a real joy to belay somebody who knows what they are doing and are moving like a climber. There's a marked difference between the way you move, and everybody else." Holy damn did that make me feel good.

This thing about movement patterns is something I've noticed in the gym, too. Just the other day, some guy was working on a simple boulder problem in the gym, maybe 5c or 6a, and had trouble sticking the moves so he asked for advice, having seen me do the problem a few minutes earlier. "Turn your hips closer to the wall," was my advice. He didn't really get it so I demonstrated, twisting first left, then right, then left again, to keep my bodyweight on top of my toes while my hands progressed from crimpy hold to crimpy hold without needing to lift my whole body at any point. He got it the first try after my demonstration. For me, it was pure intuition - I didn't consciously think about my movement until he asked me.

My body has transformed from the nerd body of 30 to a more muscular version of the same. Practically no body-fat, but about 5-6kg more upper-body muscle. So that feels nice when I see myself in the mirror - I look a bit like a climber.

As a result, from how I move to how I feel and how I think I look, when people ask me about hobbies or exercise, I've changed from saying "I like to climb" to "I'm a climber." It seems insignificant, perhaps, but there's an identity shift between being a dude who climbs, and a climber dude.

I don't have any particular reason for writing this post, except I wanted to share my experience. I still have tons of things to work on - especially shoulder flexibility and flexibility in my legs are holding me back, but also I'm not great at using pockets or cracks. I'd like to climb more outside, but there are limited options near where I live. Still, climbing is a source of joy and inner peace, and I'm looking forward to continuing to slowly and incrementally build my climbing ability. Who knows, perhaps a 6c is just around the corner?
What I learned after coming back from a 1 and a half year break. I started seriously climbing at 12 years old, and took a break at 17. At my strongest, I climbed 3-5 times per week doing around v10/v11, 5.12c/5.13c. I initially took a few months off because I hurt my thumb really bad in a sparring match, but then other life jazz got in the way so it ended up being much longer. 


I've been lifting for a few months to get fitness back before climbing, I can do maybe 20 body weight pull ups. Today was my first session back, and holy shit man, I lost alot more then I expected. I didn't push it too hard, I was able to do up to v3 pretty okay. I could potentially do v4 but I didn't want to push it. The thing that really shocked me was just how much my endurance fell. Before, I would do 2hour Boulder sessions at 90-95% intensity and be okay. Today I felt destroyed after a medium intensity 45minute bouldering session. Top roping after it was really difficult, I struggled on 5.9s.  Overall, I was pretty surprised by how much I lost. Hopefully it comes back quicker then it took in the first place, although I don't want to rush myself. Moral of the story, don't take a year and a half off.
How exactly do hangboarding, campusing, and moon/tension/systems board climbing differ in making you crimp better, and what can you do to test which would be the most helpful? Currently, I'm about 2 grades worse at any kind of crimpy climbing, vertical or overhung, than (not sure what word to use here... non-crimpy? open-handed?) other kinds. My best outdoor sends are 2 8s and a 7/8, but on anything with a crux/hard crimp move, I'm nowhere near that. I want to get better at those kinds of climbs with structured training, but it seems that all 3 of the things I mentioned would help in some way. So I'd like to get a better understanding of how exactly training with each of the tools would help me with climbing on smaller holds and also to learn if there's any way to 'test' what I'm weakest at and which would lead to the best results. Sorry if this counts as a 'simple question', if someone thinks it does I can move it to the weekly thread.
Problems set by pros on Tension board Can you all share names of pros who have set problems on the tension board?  Thanks!!
Picking drills to progress past low grades Hi all! I’ve climbed for the past 2 years, and I’m becoming quite frustrated with my lack of progression so I’ve decided to get a bit more serious and incorporate more drills into my sessions. However, I have very little experience with training design, so I thought I might tap into the collective wisdom.

First things first :
- I’m about to turn 30.
- I weigh 75kg for 179cm, at around 13-14% body fat.
- I primarily practice bouldering nowadays, but in my first year I used to 60/40 bouldering/top roping. I’ve started to lead recently.
- In my first year, I climbed two to three times a week in London gyms (great diversity), and with partners that were a lot more experienced than I was. I was incorporating drills.
- Since the beginning of my second year, I climb in Paris (very poor diversity, ungraded problems in most gyms) and I’ve struggled to find regular climbing partners, let alone people who are better than I am. I have been much more irregular both for motivation and scheduling reasons, and I don’t use drills anymore.
- I max at 6a+ indoor routes, and 6b/V4 indoor problems. I don’t believe I’ve progressed at all for a year or so.
- I expect to get back on a twice/week minimum schedule, having found new partners.

Ok, now that I’ve established that, I feel I currently have 3 limiting factors : sub-optimal technique, grip strength and endurance. I expect endurance to develop again as I keep lead climbing and tope roping, so I won’t work on it specifically. For the other two, I’ve identified a few drills that I believe are beneficial, and I’d like your advice on how to incorporate them into my bouldering sessions (can’t do them all every time)

- Traverse warm-up
- Downclimb warm-up
- Downclimb everything
- 3 second hand hover 
- Rockover (nose touching every hand hold before grabbing)
- Focus on slabs (I don’t trust my feet enough)
- 3 limbs climbing, to develop better dynamic technique
- Repeat at-limit climbs (2x, 3x, 5x ?) 
- Foot stabs (standing in front of the wall, and dynamicly dropping one foot to a hold to improve aim)
- Longer sessions (currently around 2 hours)
- Diet and lose some weight.

So, which of these options do you consider to be serious, and which ones do you believe to be rubbish? How would you cycle the efficient ones into my sessions? 

Thanks in advance for your help! (and yes, I know the first step is “climb more”. I’m trying, but I can’t always do it)
Growing Good Skin While Healing Skin **This isn’t just about healing skin, but for people who climb outside a lot and are trying to build and heal**

So to get good climbing skin you usually need some time on rock. Ideally we would stop the second a single layer came off and apply some kind of skin product, but unless this is the local crag and/or you just sent your project, this rarely happens.

So some of us are in that state where we fear getting something out of the microwave and using the trackpad on our laptop almost makes our pads seep. How can one slowly return to normal/good skin, but continue to build it? Allowing 5 days mid week it seems that the weekend always gets me right back to where I started and it’s a constant struggle. With a 2 week trip coming up I don’t want to completely lose what I’ve farmed, but don’t wanna be screwed on day 3.

Lately I have been:

* Taping anything that is looking thin. Outside I will use glue and Leukotape and re-tape if necessary, indoors I can get away with no glue. I will keep it taped until it has enough layers to not be constantly too worn.
* Following climbing I wash hands immediately, apply Climb Skin as necessary. This seems to soften my pads up, relieve pain slightly.
* At night I use performance cream or tip juice and then after that dry apply Climb On. For me, Climb On is annoying, but I get thicker skin with consistent use.
* Using super sharp fingernail clippers to remove any excess skin between burns.
* Sand visible ridges with either 80 grit or 160 grit.
* Salves always make my skin feel soft, greasy, and shitty, I avoid J Tree like the plague. The Rhino Split seems to be the best for acute seeping/bleeding.
* And obviously stopping before I have split.
The Game Changers (Netflix) Yo, have you seen the new documentary about sport PROS and vegan diet "The Gamechangers" on Netflix?

Opinions with regards to Climbing?  Do you know any vegan climbers than can confirm

greatly increased strength, power, endurance, and recovery?
Isometryx - opensource digital hangboard Hi there, I'm Tom, a (french) recreative (nerd) climber. 42 yrs old, 7a onsight outside, busy life and training once a week (basic strength, limit moves &amp; hangboarding) essentially to stay injury-free when climbing outside and because I enjoy it. That's for myself.

As a huge fan of Dr Tyler Nelson and its research on isometric training applications for rock climbing [https://www.trainingbeta.com/the-simplest-finger-training-program/](https://www.trainingbeta.com/the-simplest-finger-training-program/) I've made a tool that I wanted to share with the community.

&amp;#x200B;

[the isometryx board](https://preview.redd.it/dhbw0y5ephv31.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c49f16ec447526622543aad872f931649ae4c5ca)

I know that there are some new "connected" hangboards coming up next to the market but as I didn't want to buy an already made product that wouldn't really suits my needs, I've developed a small prototype based on Arduino which is very simple and useful to measure how much force you put on fingers when hanging. It's basically a bluetooth scale for fingers with a small display screen, 4 load sensors and 2 campus rungs. You can collect data via the bluetooth channel. Actually I use it for warming up my fingers (one by one) and to do some max one-harm-hangs with accurate measurement of the applied load (in kg). As I'm really far from being able to do a one-arm-hang on a 20mm edge, I can measure my progress from session to session.

I've planned to create an app implementing different hangboard protocols and I want it to be Open Source (both hardware setup &amp; softwares).

Would someone be interested to contribute to this project, as developer or specifications writer's or anything ? I can open a github project to those who would like to experiment with me on this toys.
plateau - how to re-learn technique and get small Hey all... I think I have the opposite problem than most climbers, with the same result.    I'm seeing if anyone has any direct advice/experience that can help me out.

I'm 6'3 and athletic.  I've played sports my whole life, I kayak and was a raft guide for years... long story short I'm pretty strong and tall... I also have extremely tight hips and semi-tight shoulders (mainly from basketball and kayaking).   This combination has lead to me over-pulling/chicken winging a lot , and figuring out odd tall man/power beta often.   Don't get me wrong.. I have decent footwork, but I'll do just about anything to avoid being bunched up or having high feet with both hips open to the wall.

IMO the gym in general sets to avoid super scrunchy/high feet moves..   I can flash most 5's and do most 6's in a few tries, but there are always problems which I simply cannot do (not my style at all).   In the past I just moved on as it's a climbing gym and climbing was more of my 2nd or 3rd sport. 

Outside I'm sure you all know there are far more scrunchy problem and the holds are smaller/less incut.  This prevents the chicken wing and forces me into my un-comfort zone.   Again in the past i'd just move on to other problem... find and compression arete etc that played to my strengths not my weaknesses. 

Long story short I am now climbing quite a bit more and have the short term goal of sending a v8 and being able to climb most v6's outside.   To do this I need to be more flexible and have better footwork.   What do you all recommend?  Most of the stuff on this page is about building strength... I know I need to stretch etc... but does anyone have any specific advice?  

TL;DR  -  I can do \~15+ pullups, have (decently) strong hands, front lever ect... but my hips tight AF and I often cant stay close enough to the wall.
How to not feel like your knee is going to explode when heel hooking? Feels like just practicing heel hooks and doing them makes my knees and legs hurt more. How do I get stronger at heel hooking? Thanks!
If you could restart your climbing &amp; training career, what would you do differently? Just got back from a 4 month break. I was focusing on strength rather than becoming a better climber. For example, I plan on prioritizing hip flexibility instead of 1 arm pull ups. Just curious what any of you would do differently?

Thanks for all of the amazing responses. Thank you for reflecting honestly about your climbing history and pitching in. This was a great thread to read and was helpful!
As a beginner who is "just climbing", what are the most important things for me to measure? This is a bit of a followup on /u/climbcore's thread on what it means to "just climb", which I enjoyed reading ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/dm3n7b/just_climb_discussion_on_what_this_means/)).

Speaking as a beginner, I've found the advice of "just climb"  to be largely unhelpful, although I agree with the sentiment behind it where just climbing will give you the biggest win in terms of progressing. 

My issue with the advice "just climb" is that it's not always clear what you're measuring or how you're structuring your climbing session. 

To me, it's sort of like saying to someone who wants to become a great swimmer to "just swim" in the water or to someone who wants to be good at boxing to "just box" the punching bag. Yes, just climbing on the wall should be the primary focus for overall growth, but how much time on the wall? How frequently each week? How much volume in a given session? If I have 1 1/2 hours 3x/week to train, how do I make the most of that time? These have been all questions I've had as I've progressed this past year. While I can definitely say I've progressed, there's a lingering question of wondering if I could maximize the limited time I've had to "just climb" in a better way moving forward versus just showing up at the gym and wandering from boulder to boulder or route to route. 

I don't think we have to be advanced with our measurements but measuring something can help with motivation, awareness, and identifying weaknesses. Any other sport I've trained in or competed in has had a system in place for tracking and measuring your progress through training. Maybe it's just me and more of an individual preference but I really find this helpful for my own motivation and progress. 

All that said, what do you think are the most important metrics to focus on in your first year of "just climbing"? What do you think?
A couple things ive learnt from my A2 Pulley Injury Approximately three weeks ago I full ruptured my A2 Pulley, and in the spirit of wanting to help others who suspect they have recently suffered a finger injury, I thought I would share some of the things I learnt. 

* Try not to read too much into online articles and self diagnose. Ironically (considering I'm writing this post) I would avoid taking advice from forums where other climbers talk about their injury and return to climbing; especially if they self diagnosed. I'm ashamed to admit I found myself thinking I didn't have a full rupture because of my symptoms and the things I'd read, but the imaging and formal diagnosis was very clear. There is plenty of good information online and it's great to be relatively informed, but almost all the articles advise seeking professional advice and I fully support this because it everyone is different and can experience different symptoms. To hopefully emphasis this, here are a few of my early symptoms and quirks I experienced:
   * Little to no swelling for the first three days, but swelling can be significant;
   * Tenderness to touch at the base of my finger (typical);
   * The tendon felt like it came further off the bone (bow stringing) when compared to the same non-injured finger while pressing the finger and thumb together (typical, but it can be hard to tell any difference for an A2 injury);
   * I could move the finger through the full range without support and experienced no pain or stiffness when doing so, but range of moment can be affected and/or painful;
   * A lot of pain at the base of my finger during even the slightest loading and almost no strength when trying to pull on anything with any sort of force (typical);
   * A loud snap/pop when the injury occured. Some sources say pop is the sound of a rupture, others say it's the sound of a tear, and that ruptures are rare. Other sources say you might not hear anything at all because youre concentrating on the send. 
* My sports doctor told me the only way to really know whats happened is with ultrasound or MRI imaging.
* Get the diagnosis as soon as possible; preferably by an experienced radiologist and sports doctor who sees these injuries regularly. The radiologist and doctor told me that sometimes when patients wait over two weeks to get imaging, the pulley will already be partially healed and will look like a tear instead of a rupture. The catch 22 is that in the first two weeks, fluid buildup in the affected area can make it difficult to diagnose. Regardless, it's best to get imaging and diagnoses as soon as possible to get onto the correct course of rehab.

The injury has put everything on hold for at least 3-6 months, and its a bummer, but its given some perspective to my training. Without going into the specifics (there has been a lot of reflection and discussion with physios and experienced climbers), it's been hard to pinpoint any preventative measures I could have done specific to the A2 injury, but I am guilty of not training antagonist muscles and core as much as I could. Now having a better grasp of how devastating time off climbing and training can be, I've decided to give a much greater focus to the antagonist muscles and core, and will incorporate movement drills to reduce the overall chance of injury.

I sincerely wish all those suffering with injury the best with your recovery!
Thoughts about volume climbing outdoors. Near me there is very strange limestone crag - super technical, there aren't any holds or footholds, the grades feel significantly harder if you are not used to the style and this is an opinion not only mine, but some profi climbers here thing the same.

So i set a goal to climb all 6a's (5.10a) when I'm climbing around 7b on routes which suits me. And i'm having a hard time onsighting those 6a's. Are there any people here who did the same. Did you see any benefits? What are your thoughts about this challenge? 

P.S. i'm trying to improve my technique.
Why do we microadjust on bad holds? Something I've realised that seemingly everyone does, is making microadjustments when grabbing any hard-to-hold holds.

[example](https://www.facebook.com/redbulladventure/videos/778953892528673/)

&amp;#x200B;

There are so many examples of this, and pretty much everyone does it. Just thought it would be interesting if anyone has any ideas, whether it's to find the best position to hold or a biomechanical reason like reinforcing engagement...
Transitioning from Sport Climbing to Bouldering Hi everyone,

Background: I have been sport climbing on/off for around 5 years now, outdoors best onsight is an 11a, best send 11c. My gym grades are a little bit better 11b/11d, respectively. (I'm 25f if that matters, I know that these numbers seem pretty low compared to what I see discussed here often...I blame it on summers spent on 5.easy trad routes?). My typical gym sessions now are: spend around an hour on routes 11b and below (working my way up), then spend another hour or two on routes 11c-12b. I usually leave feeling like I got a good workout in (not exhausted, though).

&amp;#x200B;

I recently moved, and the most convenient gym near me now is a bouldering gym...I have been a few times now, and I usually find problems up to V3 to be easy, and up to V4-5 pretty easy once I figure out the beta (typically after at most  3 tries). I don't really feel tired after these attempts, or like I had to give it "my all".

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is two fold:

(1) I try harder problems, in the v5+ range, but they always feel impossible, and no matter how many times I try them, I don't get any better at the problem (often these involve really awful slopers or big moves on steep walls) . Am I just not trying hard enough?

(2) I never feel gassed after bouldering...Maybe this is a good thing, but I like feeling like I worked out... I have tried circuits and taking minimal rests. I don't want to lose too much endurance because I want to spend next summer sport/trad climbing.

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate any advice!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you everyone for the advice! You are making me psyched to boulder over the winter!
Moonboard drills Does anyone know if/where I can find lists of Moonboard problems with a specific type of move?

Recently I wanted to work on Pogos and Crossover moves and tried to find lists of problems of progressive difficulty for each of these techniques. 

So far I haven't found anything. The app does have a shared list function but nothing comes up, I'm not familiar with the feature though so may be using it wrong. 

I have now started going back through Benchmark problems making my own lists but would be great not to reinvent the wheel if something is already available.

Thanks and sorry if the question has come up before
Are there any climbing guides/industry pros on this sub? I'm not sure if this is the correct sub for this, but I feel like these demographics overlap. I was wondering if there were any guides who frequent this sub who maybe could talk about the livelihood of guiding or working with a climbing oriented company! Are there careers out there that people maybe aren't aware of? Do you work behind the scenes or work with or in service of people who share your passion/ideals? I'd just love to hear from you! 

For context. I'm a 23 year old who just got his first professional job (environmental engineering consulting) and I am decidedly unhappy with it and how little passion I have for the clients or objectives of the industry. I've always been passionate about climbing since day one (5+ years on the rock at this point) and I'm fairly confident the next step in my life and livelihood is going to involve that in some capacity. I've worked all over, love the outdoors and climbing, but also have a technical education and work experience. Before this big boy job I was working at a climbing gym in CA. Loved the people and the proximity to climbing and Yosemite, but being pretty well below the poverty line with no real path made it unsustainable for me at that time.
Getting into vegan diet + climbing training any vegan climbers around?

I've recently changed my diet into a vegan one and I'm struggling getting my proteins without gaining weight. Any tips? I find difficult to control the calories eaten with so many nuts and seeds.

Any favourite snaks to bring to the crag?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!
Improve technique by watching? Hi everyone! In the last period I' ve been following avidly both lead and boulder WC. This means spending hours and hours watching pro climbers climbing without all the tranisitions, cuts and other stuff typical of other climbing videos. 
My impression is that after that my technique improved, expecially  the part of my "library of movement". I seem to find better solution and be able to recognize useful patterns. 
My question is: Am I crazy? 
I' ve simply got better because of training (actually in a 1.5 year of climbing this Is the period in which I' ve been training less) and conditioned myself into thinking that this is realated to watching other climb? 
Or someone experienced similar phenomenon? 
If yes have you ever thought of implementing it in a more structured way in your training routine?
SLEEP Hello fellow climbers

Since I started climbing (about a year ago), I've noticed that the sleep I need before was now not enough. 
I climb 3 times a week but with really high volume and intensity. 
Before, I could sleep for 6-7 hours and be fine with it. Now I have to sleep at least 8 hours a night, and when I get the chance to sleep more, I do. Normally around 10 hours. I have a pretty busy life and sleeping that much feels like taking a lot of my free time..

How much do you sleep?
How did your climbing affect your sleeping needs? 
Any tips how I could change the amount of sleep I have to get?
Any good resources for dealing with common tall climber problems? I've seen a dozen videos on "short climber problems" and how to deal with them, but never had much luck with the opposite, in particular stuff like bunched up sit starts, handling the extra weight and such.

Every now and then I hear some solid info but that doesn't go into depth. E.g. Adam Ondra has mentioned getting hip flexibility and getting comfortable with high steps, in his latest video in particular. I also am aware of the importance of core. But these are pretty broad subjects.

Are there any videos/articles  out there on specific workouts people are doing? Drills, beta comparisons between a normal climber/tall climber on bunched up moves? That kind of stuff?

Let's try to avoid a short vs tall discussion and stick to constructive content if possible? We all have our own problems to deal with. Anecdotal stories from tall climbers that took a specific approach to fixing their weaknesses and how they helped would be very welcome.
Experienced climber looking for tips on gaining finger strength with hyper extending fingers. I have been climbing for about 8 years now, and have bouldered v13 and lead 13c.  I would say that my pulling strength, body tension, etc are very strong, however I often rely on them to compensate for my lack of finger strength.  Crimping hard is something that I have never really been able to do because the joints in my fingers hyperextend, which causes bad pain whenever I crimp hard, specifically when I full crimp (wrap my thumb).  I have also been plagued with finger injuries, mostly minor a2 pulley tears.  As of right now my fingers are healthy but I still feel very limited to boulders in specific styles that don’t involve hard crimping. Does anyone have any experience training fingers that hyperextend or that are prone to injury? Any information, experience, etc would be much appreciated.
Would I have a higher ceiling on Lead in the spring/summer if I spent the winter months focusing on bouldering? Exactly as the title says. My passion is Lead and I got my first couple 11-'s outside this past season. I'm of course looking ahead and would love to come back in the spring and start putting down some 11+'s and projecting 12-s. 

Would my agenda be helped by essentially cutting out gym-leading in favor or more limit bouldering? I'd also supplement with 4x4's for endurance and hang boarding for finger strength.

Maybe this is completely bat-brained, I Don't know, but it kinda seems like it might work. My current schedule is something like 2 days a week - 1 day gym redpointing, 1 day project bouldering and because of the season, I'll probably do 3 days a week in the gym this winter.
Do You Film Yourself Climbing? Has it helped you improve? I'm interested in hearing if people have taken the time filming themselves climbing, not to post online, but for self-evaluation. Was it worth the time? Did you discover things about your body positioning, etc? Did it help you improve?
Is it generally worth it to give yourself a micro-rest on a crux at the middle or end of a boulder problem or is more energy efficient to just go for it right away? There's a problem in my gym where the first 80% is a v5 and then there's a v7 move that I can hit individually but can't do the whole thing. There's no easier technique, I've asked stronger climbers and they all do it the same way. It's just a hard dead point throw.

I practice the move by doing sets of that move individually.

When starting from the beginning, is it smarter to take a micro-rest before the move or just go for it?
Projecting well-above your grade [Outside] I had a hard time thinking of a good title for this. 

But basically, I set a goal of climbing 5.13a next year. Recently, I found one that might be a great candidate. I was able to hit the chains after a lot of work at the crux. I feel it's a good candidate because the climbing isn't harder than 11+ with a soft 12a move mixed in, the crux is all permadrawed until the chains, and the crux itself is only about 2-3 moves with a mid 12 finish. 

The reason I'm asking is I have yet to redpoint 12+. I know there's a lot of input on doing pyramids and such. Will this be pretty ineffective for climbing harder routes?

For what it's worth, I believe this route will improve my fitness and strength so working the route for a bit should actually be beneficial.
Hangboard Repeaters Interval Timing - Choose what works! Hey all,

Maybe this isn't news to anyone (haven't been on this sub in a while) but I want to share a story about how adjusting my repeaters protocol has enabled me to to use the hangboard more effectively and consistently lately.

In the past I could never motivate myself to hangboard because popular workouts all felt too difficult, either physically or logistically. Single 10 second hangs were almost too hard for me, and the 7/3 protocols didn't allow me to rest enough to complete even one full 60-second set. I also do not have the desire or motivation to faff around with pulleys and weights.

This kept me away from the board for years until recently when I discovered that I could do 5 second hangs with 5 seconds rest basically forever on a medium-ish edge. This gave me the idea to try hanging for 6 seconds and resting for 4 seconds in place of the typical 7 and 3.

Hanging for 6 seconds and resting for 4 (as opposed to 7 and 3) works a lot better for me because it makes the board more approachable--a single set is doable, and fun! Considering time under tension, the difference between these two protocols is minimal over the course of a set (only 6 seconds). More, if you're like me, the 6/4 protocol allows you to do more sets, increasing TUT in aggregate!

I've only been doing this a few times a week for a month or two, and combined with some focused, power-oriented bouldering on my gym's 45 degree spray wall, I feel a lot stronger. I'm actually beginning to surprise myself with the moves that I can stick. I also climbed my first V8 out in the Happy Valley/Hideaway last week, so that's cool! Did it in 1 session too!

Thanks for reading. I wrote this because I know it can be difficult to deviate from what experts suggest is the best hangboard protocol. I hope this post underscores the importance of making adjustments that suit you. Training for climbing is far far far from a science! Listen to those smarties on the podcasts for sure, but also try your own thing!

Best,

p4l
Can we stop the "advice appreciated" posts? rule 3  feels like its being stomped on a bit with a bunch of the posts of late. They'd be awesome if they followed the rules within the section but as of now, many feel like spray.
What's the average climbing grade where people plateau? As not every person on earth can be Caldwell, Honnold or any other professional climber. I was wondering where people (on average) max out on their grade.

I live in Europe, I started climbing in January 2019 (10 months). Now climbing  6B/6C boulders and sometimes even almost a full 7A sport climb. These are averages as every climbing gym is different but I went to some major climbing gyms (Innsbruck). I have limited experience on rocks although I climbed in the Dolomites, Italy &amp; Austria on different kind of rocks.

In my home climbing gym. Most people seem to climb &lt; 6A (beginners). Then you have the 2nd group which is mostly the more dedicated people who climb 6A-7B. And then there's this small group which do extremely difficult stuff as well. We have routes graded as hard as 9B+(boulder) in our gym. But those tend to be climbed by the routesetters and maybe 1-2 other people.

So that leaves me to the question.... do most people eventually plateau on a grade?

There's a lot of people that I know in the gym that climb over 10 years and still aren't past 7A. Is it something that most people can achieve by training enough or is it really something for a selective group of people?

Just curious.

I feel that I make less progress. Mostly due to lack of technique (not knowing what to do) and body tension/finger strength.

&amp;#x200B;

**Note: As people has commented on the 9B+. Due to inexperience I'm not sure if the route is really that grade. Could be a joke by the routesetters to indicate how hard it is. Don't know them personally as it's a very big gym. Routes are color graded and our most difficult color is mint which is 8A-9 written down next to the wall.**

**edit: asked the gym staff, it was a joke from the routesetter to keep people of his personal project**

**Edit 2: thanks for the massive amount of answers, really appreciated. Kind climbing folks on here**
Dave MacLeod Put Out a Video Discussing "Game Changers" Only tangentially related to this board, but the movie has already attracted discussion here, and people seem to respect Dave's opinion.
What are some counterintuitive things that worked for you? **Or also some things other people like that didn't.**  While there is no consensus on training in climbing, there are some ideas that tend to be predominant around training and performance.

For me, the things that haven't worked:

* **Hangboarding AM/Anything above aero cap or easy leading PM**. I always feel like I am overgripping, "imbalanced" with how I am pulling, and power down fast.
* **Climbing much below 50F/send temps**. My skin gets dry, splits easy, and I seem to move worse even if I stay warm.
* **4x4 type intervals** The Lattice Crimp'd 6-in-6 also qualifies. My quality goes down by the end and I find that the overall session is a bit high volume for the stimulus it provides.
* **Dynamic stretching for flexibility/mobility** Seemed more like awkward gymnastics and never felt productive.
* **Single arm isometrics/lock offs** I got stronger at them, but saw zero transfer. I don't feel they improved any aspect of shoulder stability or pulling power.
* **10sec hangs** No clue why but going much over 6-7s for max hangs seems to just fatigue me more and my weights never progress.

**Things that work, but are counterintuitive/not accepted:**

* **Limit bouldering or projecting on second day on** I don't know how, but my second day is often my best.  I've been shit after 2 rest days, awesome on the 2nd day on so many times now that it is fairly predictive.
* **Static Stretching** People claim it doesn't work, studies show this and that, but honestly it makes me feel good and I have significantly increased my mobility and ROM. Experiment a bit.
* **Apply ClimbSkin or Rhino Recovery before climbing in cold weather** While ClimbSkin does recommend this I never see anyone do it. Has been a game changer for bad skin/not splitting.
* **Repeaters for building strength** I find that using ~1:2 work:rest to be just as effective as max hangs for me and I can often do them any time of day.
* **Using recovery ranges for circuits**  Generally speaking the work:rest ratio of an cap work is 1:2-1:4. I would rather combine problem lengths and ballpark the recovery and get more diversity in then do a block of 12-14 moves, then 8-10, or whatever. Far less contrived, easy to implement almost anywhere.
Improving Technique With Small Gym and Limited Access to Outdoors Background: I go to school in the Northeast of the US. Unfortunately there are no climbing gyms anywhere nearby (3+ hours away), except for my University's climbing wall. I've spent most of my time bouldering 3 or 4 days a week on it, but there is only one bouldering wall with give or take 15 problems on it. Several below my range and several above. I've been climbing for almost a year now, but primarily in the last 5 months and am around the V3 range indoors on this wall. My university also has a top roping wall, but I've yet to dive into that. I've been bouldering outdoors a few times, but there aren't many nearby options either and I do not have a car.

I am wondering what some good ways to work on climbing technique would be with my limited resources. I have tried some boulders outside and find myself lacking extremely in technique, I have almost no experience with heel hooks or toe hooks and a lot of advanced movements, or at least that is how it feels. Does anyone have any ideas for other ways to try and train?
Getting to 7A (boulder/sport climbing) I'll try to keep it short.

Started January 2019. Did some lessons in basic techniques, toprope and lead climbing.

**Boulder**: 6A-6B easily, depending on overhang. 6B-6C can do as well, unless it's massive overhang or small crimps.**Sport climbing**: 6B-6C easily, depending on the length of the route since I cannot sport climb too much due to not having belayers enough.

I tried a few 7A and 7A+, in sport climbing I get to the crux and then mostly fall out.In boulder, it's mostly not working, unless it has some very big dyno's or dynamic moves (which are my favourite).

Everyone that I know since I started climbing either quit or still are doing lower grades. As I love climbing a lot and having searched for more advanced technique classes and not finding anything. I am coming to /r/climbharder.

I know my technique or lack of skill to know how to start some routes and find the best way to grab the holds and especially foot placement is holding me back. Is there any way that you guys would advise me to follow? Any tips/tricks that I should check out and try on the wall? Moonboarding? 

Seeing others climbing a route and use their movement pattern mostly works for me but that isn't always ideal or sometimes I just want to find the way myself and not "steal" their beta.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!

Synovitis cured I'm sharing about my experience healing chronic DIP synovitis.

**Diagnosis and symptoms**: Self-diagnosed, January this year. It came from hyperextension of the index DIP joint in a crimping position. Inflammation, painful to touch at edge of phalanx, reduced ROM, quick to flare up. In addition to synovitis, the injury could conceivably be a Volar Plate Avulsion or a bone spur, but I did not feel the need to get it checked out. I have had enough experience taking climbing injuries to my local PTs and doctors to be convinced they are next to useless (a local doctor once diagnosed me with tennis elbow when the pain was on the other side of the joint). Having said that, I guess an x-ray could’ve been useful in retrospect.

**Early attempts to resolve**: Wore a splint at night, taped when climbing, voodoo flossing, massage. A 2 week trip to font temporarily healed the injury (at the 3 month mark), probably because of open-handing, but it came back within a week of being back on my home rock. At the 5 month mark I took 3 weeks off but actually that made it worse. I found that finger rolls and progressive fingerboarding helped it but it never went away completely.

Although I was getting by, avoiding crimps, sandstone season was on the horizon, and with it my project which of course features a nasty crux gaston crimper which massively stressed the injured joint. One of the hardest moves Ive ever tried, and I needed to be fully healed to stand a chance on it.

**Resolution**: I doubled down on the dumbbell finger rolls. Or actually, quintupled down. I adapted Dave MacLeod’s advice for elbow tendinopathy (with wrist curls in this case), and decided to go higher resistance with high volume. 6x20 reps at a weight that produced failure at 20 reps (started at 25 lbs raised to 40 lbs after 6 weeks). Twice per day every day (ie. 240 reps/day).

This routine has proved to be almost magic. Controlled fingerboarding, open-handing while climbing, arthritis gloves (thanks u/soviet_cat), massage, etc. all worked to some extent but the finger rolls were the ultimate cure. Nothing else has changed, Im pretty strict with my diet and this has remained constant.

I dont know why finger rolls are so effective. I guess they push around the synoval fluid, which must help. And break up scar tissue? Im no expert, anything here would be pure speculation on my part.

Steven Low ([u/eshlow](https://www.reddit.com/u/eshlow/)) has given good [advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/8jidkd/wizened_veterans_have_any_of_you_beaten_chronic/) on this sub about synovitis (and many other things), and is also a big fan of finger rolls. I just had to do a lot more of them and far more regularly to achieve full recovery.

The usual disclaimers apply.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: DIP synovitis fully cured with dumbbell finger rolls 6x20 reps at a weight that produced failure at 20 reps (started at 25 lbs raised to 40 lbs after 6 weeks). Twice per day every day (ie. 240 reps/day). Warmup properly beforehand. YMMV.
Climbing, Weight, Body Image I've struggled with weight and body image most of my life. I'm not really thin, not muscular, just average. When I started climbing I lost around 10lb and felt better about myself and climbing improved.  Been a healthy eater most of my life (dabbled with weightlifting and all sorts of diets over the years) if not overly consumed by what some people call orthorexia. I thought climbing would promote healthier behaviors due to the amazing amount of stuff climbers seem to do and still stay in fantastic shape, but it's been the opposite.

I don't have performance issues, I have climbed 7B+/7c. I guess I hate gym culture where it's a bunch of shirtless bros getting stoked about smashing plastic and looking cool (but they often don't on actual rocks). I worked with a nutritionist for a little while, but gained some weight back and had a rough month of climbing and forever have the 2 associated.

People try to promote things like "weight doesn't matter", but it definitely seems to. Or should I say "very low bodyfat", which I have never had. This image is all we see in climbing media and it gets subconsciously reinforced. As a result I see myself subconsciously make choices that limit my intake and what I enjoy so that I hopefully end up looking the part and getting another leap in performance liked I originally got. In the end it is tanking my training and performance.  

Have you ever dealt with something like this? If so, how did you get over it?
Examples of incredible movement In "Exposure Vol. II", Kevin Jorgeson said the following about DW-- "When daniel gets in that low gear, you better watch out". If you've seen enough of  elite climbers smashing hard double-digit boulders on youtube, you just know they move differently. They move slowly and precisely with rediculous tension and strength until they need the power--and then they go right back into that "low gear". The entire chain from their toes to thier fingers are fucking bulletproof--which allows them to execute movement without wasted momentum or movement.

Anyway, Id like to open up a discussion about the styles of climbers and maybe specific examples of excellent climbing/tension. Maybe personal opinions about morphology, sequence, general thoughts etc. Too often on this subreddit I see posts about reps/sets/cycles, which is a critical component of training, but we dont talk about examples of amazing movement and the best examples of good climbing.

An analysis of movement from the best climbers offers insight into how we can identify our own weaknesses and strengths
Interesting endurance benchmark from Reini Scherer (Austrian national coach) Was just re-reading some stuff I downloaded a while back - beginner/intermediate/pro training plans written by Reini Scherer. Reini who? Reini Scherer who was the Austrian national coach at the time when Austria was the Japan *and* Slovenia of competition climbing. Coach of David Lama, Angie Eiter, Killian Fischhuber, Anna Stöhr, Jakob Schubert ...
Reini knows what he's talking about. Certainly has more experience of coaching actual world class athletes than anybody writing in the English language.

The [programmes](http://www.kletterzentrum-tivoli.at/index.php?getPage=div/Trainingsprogramme.html&amp;menu=35) are on the website of the now-closed old Innsbruck climbing gym, so if you're interested grab 'em before somebody remembers to take the site down. If you can read German and/or know how use google translate.

Finally getting to the point: I was re-reading the intermediate programme and found a bit about endurance benchmarking. It was written in 2007 &amp; doesn't talk about energy systems as such, but what he's describing is clearly about whether you have enough aerobic capacity as a route climber. 

If you redpoint 7c, you should be able to do seven to ten 7a+ with equal work:rest (i.e. alternating with a partner). For 7a+, 6c. For 6c, 6a+

If you can do the base level routes easily, you could be redpointing harder. If you can't do them, your base endurance (*aerobic capacity?*) is underdeveloped.

I find this terrifyingly high. I redpoint around 7a/+ and there's no way in the world I could do seven to ten 6c's in a session. Back to basics for me, according to Reini.
Can we get another AMA on this subreddit? Current AMAs are pretty out of date. For instance Steve Maisch I remember in a more recent interview said he was doing repeaters now for strength instead of focussing on max hangs. It would be interesting to have a few of the old guys back on and some new ones from say C4HP or other trainers/climbers
Training to alleviate biceps tendon pain? Hey, I started bouldering 3 times a week since September and I am experiencing pain predominantly in my left bicep tendon in the elbow end during climbing.

Yesterday I had infrequent sharp pains in the tendon for the first time and I am looking for tips on prevention/ tendon training.

I am a 180cm 210lb guy with the only sport before being cycling, topping out at 5+ to 6a routes atm. I only started getting problems 3 weeks ago when I got into non entry level routes and have been taking recovery breaks of 3-4 days when I felt a session had consistent pain.

EDIT: Realised I converted my height wrong to us units. I am 180cm
Improving on technique without frequent access to a gym? Would anyone have any advice on improving technique, body positioning, breathing, etc. without having frequent access to a gym/crag? Has anyone had success in their climbing, without climbing often? Hoping to move soon, but right now I don't have anywhere to climb at on a regular basis, and technique as a whole is 100% my limiting factor at this point of my climbing. I can get to a climbing gym maybe once a week right now. Am I just SOL until I move? 


Thank you!
Anyone have Reynaud's syndrome? Beginner boulderer, starting to send V5s consistently.

Committed to making some adjustments like core/wrist conditioning and I dropped from 175 to 160lb :) Im loving this shit first time Ive been athletic really

Big question mark about hand care: I have Reynaud's syndrome which is a skin condition that limits blood flow to capillaries on extremities (hands and feets). Usually isnt an issue but I have wondered how it might impact my hand skin/strength. Anything I should know? Ive heard Arginine can be used as a supplement. Maybe Fingerless gloves? lmao
Advice on a good ratio of volume/technique bouldering to limit bouldering for a newer climber Hello,

This is an x-post from a weekly advice thread on r/bouldering.  They suggested coming over here for potentially better advice.

I've been climbing (predominantly bouldering) for a few months now. I began with a few good friends that got me into it and we all started around the same time. I watched videos and read advice that the best thing for beginners to do was to focus on volume, and not so much on limit bouldering. However, the friends I climbed with had no desire to learn proper technique and literally every climbing session was focused on limit bouldering. It was honestly just everyone trying to muscle through problems, and it looked so sloppy. I'm surprised no one got hurt badly during that time.

Their interest in bouldering has lessened recently so they rarely go. Mine has increased so that now I am going 5 times a week at least. Since every session is by myself (other than my gf going with me maybe 1-2 times a week) I've been able to focus solely on volume climbing with a huge focus on improving my body positioning, use of moves (flags, backsteps, drop knees, etc.), footwork, and all the other aspects of technique. I've noticed a HUGE improvement over the last month in how smooth I climb, how repeatable my beta is, and my overall comfort/confidence on the wall by doing this. My question is, how often/many times a week, should I actually focus on limit bouldering? My limit is primarily V3, with a V3+ every now and then. I haven't climbed much over a V2+ the last month during my focus on technique. Should I continue with this technique/volume mindset and for how long would you suggest? Would it be beneficial to mix in a limit bouldering session every now and then? If so, how often would you recommend?

I'll normally end my volume sessions with some "limit bouldering" but it's not technically my limit since I'm a little tired at that point.  But I'm curious if I should take one or more days a week and go to the gym and strictly focus on doing the hardest I can do after warming up.  Or would it be best to spend a little more time on technique/volume since I essentially skipped that phase during the start of my climbing experience?

Thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for all the great advice everyone.  I'm going to take all of this and change things up over the next couple of months. Hopefully I'll be able to report back with my first V4 climb sometime not too far in the future!
My experience with weight loss and grade progression So I was around 5’9 190lbs when I first started climbing maybe 8 years ago. Mainly weightlifting and climbing to improve strength for ninja warrior training.  I was a pretty casual climber and stayed climbing around 5.11 for a long time.  At the time I could do multiple OAP but weak core, finger strength, and tech. 

I was a casual for the past 7 years climbing infrequently. I’d maybe have 6 months every so often to get a membership and climb 3-5x a week.  It wasn’t until this year that I started to take technique work and training seriously with climbing. I also stopped weightlifting because I was getting close to my goals (315 bench/405 squat).

I got to a point this year where I was projecting V5s but could do some V6 if they were just slopers.  4x4s, hangboarding, and tech workshops weren’t putting me past my crimp weaknesses for maybe 4 months. 

Then over the course of the past 5 months I lost 15lbs and holy crap the difference is astounding. I didn’t realize what was happening until I was climbing yesterday.  I’m flashing V6 and projecting V8 at the moment.

Just wanted to share this and thanks to everyone that contributes to the sub. I’ve been lurking a long time and now I feel like the level that everyone else is at is somewhat attainable
I have Been moonboarding once or twice a week for this past month and have noticed a little progress in my movement on the board and strength! Has anyone had any big gains from moonboarding ? (OVN 6C)
How can I climb if my big toes won't bend? I'm a beginner climber (ca. 5 months in), I usually climb about three times per week and was looking for a slightly more aggressive outdoor shoe because I'm currently using the same climbing shoes for the gym and rock climbing. 

My current climbing shoes are in my normal shoe size and fit very comfortably - too comfortably, as my friends would argue: They suggest I should get a slightly smaller shoe that will allow me to bend my toes to climb with more precision. But when I went to buy climbing shoes I realized my big toes won't bend: If I push down hard on them, they'll bend a few millimeters, but that's it. 

As a result, most climbing shoes are very painful for me because they don't help me bend my toes, they just push against them. 

I really have no idea if there's anything to be done about this, but I'm curious if there are any other climbers with stiff toes out there and how they deal with it or if anyone has any suggestions on climbing shoes for freaks of nature like me ;)
Karma 8A+ Hey guys, have a trip coming up at the end of march to Fontainebleau.

There is one problem which is really on my life ToDo list. I don't think I am able to do it this trip because my max is more 7C ( I tried a 7C+ last week which felt really possible), but I wanna give it my best shot. Also have time the next 4 months to train like a berserk. Also if I try it a few times this trip I know how to work for it for the next trip.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixytN4\_cl78](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixytN4_cl78)

It looks like you need a huge amount of tension in your whole body. Not just the core. The arm has to be able to give a huge pressure on the sloper. I don't really know how I should train that.

Could you recommend some exercises or tips on how to prepare for it?

My normal training is something like 2 days on, one day focusing on pinch and slopers and one days focus on Moonboard (or moonboard styled problems). Followed by one day off. After the climbing session I normally do 1-2 strength exercises and 1-2 antagonistic exercises. For strength exercises I would switch more to front lever progression and core, because I assume this is super important.

2 months before the trip I would start to do a proper campus training.

I also think by preparing for Karma I will prepare properly for Fontainebleau anyway, because most boulders are kinda a similar style. So even if I can not do it, it is still worth it.

Happy for all feedback and comments.

EDIT: I already been to Font and yes I also love to do circuits and stuff. And I am not gonna spend my whole next trip on Karma. I still will enjoy the forest on do lots of boulders. Just wanna try in a good way. No point of trying if I am not even close, therefore some preperation makes sense. And it is not like training for Karma is just training for Karma. Karma is such a classic because it represents the style of a lot of boulder in Font. Therefore training for Karma is training for Font.
Top Three people you take climbing or training advise from. My list in no particular order..

Dave McLeod.
For his book 9-10 climbers make the same mistake.

Steve Bechtel.
For his overarching view of training, session and cycle design. 

Mani the Monkey.
For Entertainment motivation and solid advise.

I could also add in the podcasters but I’m sticking to my top three! Who are yours ? I guess I’m interested in people I haven’t heard of.
To everyone with a finger injury It gets better. 
I pulled my A2 pulley at the end of August. It’s almost back to normal now. Unfortunately the little bastards just take a long long time to heal. But daily exercises do work, even if they feel like they don’t.
A major problem is that there really not that much information out there to help.
https://youtu.be/RWZQMnlHEbg this is the best video out there imo. But at the same time it’s not the only answer. You’ve got to be sensible, listen to your body and work with it.

Once you’ve gotten over the first hurdle and are on the road to recovery don’t get complacent. If anything increase the work load and pinpoint the exercises that work for you.

To repeat, it gets better. The mental side is fucking awful. But you’ll climb again
Open-hand grip on the Moonboard - do I suck? Started training with a forced open-hand grip (taped up the PIP joint to make crimping impossible).

I jumped on the moonboard and noticed that my hand on most holds wants to go into a half-crimp, making it impossible to climb anything. I can latch the holds and hold them but as soon as I start initiating momentum for upward movement towards the next hold my fingers start going from the open-hand into a half crimp (since I taped up I just fall off at that point).

For example I can hold a side-pull above my head with the open-hand and my arm straight. As soon as I want to move my right hand towards the next hold I can feel that my left hand wants go into a half-crimp and the elbow bends to help generate momentum.

Am I just weak/shit or is it somehow physiologically harder to use the open-hand on steep terrain with small-ish holds? Does anyone actually climb open-handed on that monster?
What are some sport climbing-specific skills/techniques that boulderers don’t consider as much or at all? Things such as:

clipping dexterity/stance,

climbing pace,

identifying spots to rests, chalk up, clip,

resting efficiently, etc?


I don’t do a lot of sport climbing myself so I’m sure there are a lot of things I haven’t even considered.

References are appreciated as well.

Thanks!
Gym etiquette - how do you nicely tell someone u don't wanna small talk + are at the gym to climb? It's seriously bothering me and I don't wanna be an ass. I understand you make friends at the gym sometimes, I'm open to that.

Even when I'm wearing headphones, there are certain people who just want to chatty-kathy you to no end.

Sometimes, I just want to boulder at the gym or train and stay focused. I don't always want to make enthusiastic small talk with someone for 90 min-2 hrs.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried moving to different areas, giving short replies, wearing headphones... but even last night, this kid (ok \~29ishM) followed me to the moonboard + just sat there not even climbing/stretching/anything, kind of gawking at me for an hour, trying to pipe in to talk with me.

&amp;#x200B;

That's an extreme example. But I don't understand when people don't get the social cues + I don't want to be a dick. But my free time is really limited right now + a lot of times when I'm at the gym I'm just trying to get business done!! Ugh.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thx for all the suggestions! It could be people being creepy/hitting on others, or it could just be weird loner type people at the gym. Who knows. I tend to people-please, and have a hard time being firm. Having a few firm lines is good though, I need to think of that ammunition ahead of time so I can use it in the moment. Just gonna say "Gotta get back on the wall."; "Sorry, I have limited time today, I'm trying to focus on training."; "Best of luck with your session, I needa get to it". And from there if it escalates I’ll be rude or ask a staff member for help.
Send anxiety- does it ever go away? I find once I figure out all the moves of a climb and the only thing left to do is execute- I get super nervous and my head space gets all messed up. Does anyone else deal with this? What are some tips you’ve found to help and does this feeling ever go away?
Progression in Rock Climbing (or when performance tends to stagnate) Hi together, 

I have started to look at the [8a.nu](https://8a.nu) data to investigate how fast both average rock climbers and elite climbers progress with respect to top three redpoint ascents per year of experience. I will add further analyses about this topic (e.g. about the role of starting age for later max performance or how rock climbing and bouldering progression differs). Please let me know what you think and what you are interested in.

What are some subtle technique tips for advanced climbers? We all know the ubiquitous drills like silent feet. There are drills for drop-knees, toe-hooks, roof climbing and so on. But my question is as the title says, what are some more subtle tips for an advanced climber?

My favourite would be to look more closely at handholds and footholds. Don't look away until you've placed your foot on the hold. This ensures (hopefully) a good and clean placeing and boosts conficence if the hold is bad. Something similar is true for handholds. Make an effort to look at the handhold and then make an effort to grab it idealy the first time around, not bouncing on it too much. Some say this is neither subtle nor for advanced climbers but this is the kind of tip I'm looking for. Thanks :)
AMA - Will Anglin : The Sequel Hi everyone,

My name is Will Anglin. I co-founded Tension Climbing, I've been a coach on some level since about 2005, and I've been climbing since \~2001. It's been about 2 years since I did my first AMA here so here goes another one.

I'll try to answer some throughout the day today and then finish some off tomorrow too.

Edit 11/30: Thanks for all the great questions everyone!
Longer fingers a disadvantage on small edges? I was reading the preliminary evaluation for hangboarding from Eva Lopez.  At one point she writes to check if you are strong enough with a test on a 25 mm edge or with one phalanx and a half.

After measuring a phalanx and a half on my hands, i got 40 mm. Only my first phalanx already measures 25mm.  
So should i only be hanging on my first phalanx or do i take one phalanx and a half?

Also are longer fingers a disadvantage on small edges?  Like if you are hanging on a small edge with less percentage of your fingers, does it makes it harder?
Any tips for bouldering alone outdoors? What’s the best pad that you can strap another to, or would it be more prudent to buy two and a separate strapping mechanism? Do you guys carefully choose routes where the fall radius is limited, and if so, is it by looking at videos of beta beforehand or guidebook? Do you guys avoid highballs or does it not matter at that point if you are alone? 

Are there any emergency protocols I need to enforce if I’m alone? Do you guys have general advice for outside bouldering? 

Climbing V5/6 outdoors, V7/8 indoors - sorry, relatively new so please excuse me if these questions are simple.
What are the best Black Friday climbing hold sales? Escape Climbing is doing 30% to 35% off all in-stock climbing holds. What are some other deals?
Climbing for longevity Hello everyone! I haven't seen this discussed but I feel that this subreddit is the appropriate place to ask.

Is their anyone here who climbs for longevity? I have unfortunately been diagnosed with spinal stenosis and a degenerated disc in my neck. I also have mild osteoarthritis their and I'm only 27. It hasn't really affected my climbing so much yet, but I now realize I want to use climbing as a tool to keep my body active and in motion for the rest of my life.

I still do light weightlifting (antagonist muscles) and yoga, but climbing is my main jam right now and I love it! 

I guess my main questions are: 

* Would you consider climbing to be a great way to keep your body in shape / mobile?

* What are some ways you can ensure your climbing routine will lead to a longer, active life without many injuries?

* Any general thoughts you're willing to share?

Thanks!
Hang boarding only, no climbing Some background: I live in a very flat area without any outdoor climbing and unfortunately no climbing gyms nearby. It takes about 1.5 hours to drive to the nearest climbing gym. I really only have time to do this on weekends, so I climb on average every 1.5 weeks. At home I have a hang board but as most hang board routines are designed for people who climb often, I feel as if these routines are not enough for me. Should I do extra hang board sessions, daily for example? I am no beginner to hang boarding but I feel as if I do not have the volume of training needed to improve my finger strength. 

A final note: I am in no need of an upper body strength routine, only finger strength/ hang board advice for me.
Combining climbing with a physically demanding job How do you guys keep up with an intensive training scedule while still having to do physically demanding work during the day?   
I'm climbing 3 to 4 days a week but I feel like I don't really have rest days which keeps me from making much progress. I'm taking creatine now which helps me a bit to keep the soreness away during work but I still feel exhausted most of the time.   


I'm guessing it's someting that will always hold me back but I was hoping if others might have some tips
Climbstrong.com Training Programs I saw some older posts on this, but I wanted to see if was still being used/relevant. Has anybody used any of the specific climbing plans on climbstrong.com? If so, how have they worked for you?
Who is the weakest professional climber? Who do you think the (comparatively) weakest professional climber is? I've seen a lot of videos of Megos lately and he's so STRONG. Besides my shoulders, I'm a pretty weak climber. Lately, I've been working on my technique instead of trying to get strong. I know professional climbers all have amazing technique, but I'm assuming the "weaker" professionals likely have unique beta as compared to the more powerful climbers.
Curious how many in this community would also consider themselves "runners" and how much that helps in climbing There seems to be a pretty heavy overlap, at least in my gym. 

Obviously it's going to help with your cardio, but how important is having a running regimen to being an elite climber? 

Is cardio from good 4x4s enough for *this* sport?
Tips for a newbie with lead climbing / climbing outdoors - confidence and technique I am relatively new to climbing, and recently went on a trip with my local climbing group to try outdoor climbing for the first time.

Safe to say, I have mixed feelings about it now. We were chucked straight onto lead immediately (I have only ever led inside once), I assume it was an encouragement kinda thing but for someone who has never climbed outside going straight onto lead was pretty terrifying. I have a major fear of falling, and mentally I know hold myself back a lot climbing indoors and outdoors because of this but it is something that I a working on.

My issue is, obviously I made some mistakes, couple times looked like a dumbass, and I learnt a lot over the trip about climbing and what not, but can't help but just feel a bit discouraged and fearful for next time because of how scared I was. The people at my club are nice but often times just like 'suck it up', which I know to some extent is fair, but I feel a bit judged by people who have been climbing for years over my mistakes. They weren't anything too bad but I feel quite paranoid and overwhelmed as I'm aware of the dangers of climbing yet at the same time I feel quite chucked into the deep end.

Sometimes I wonder if I am cut out for it. I joined climbing because I wanted a sport that was just we mentally challenging as it is physically, but tbh recently my confidence has been dwindling and I worry people think I am just extremely bad and not right for the sport. I shouldn't care what others think but it's such a community led sport it's kinda hard not to.

Any general tips for getting over the mental blocks and when / if you make a mistake? And also just tips for outdoor climbing in general really

For now I think I am just going to work on my overall fitness and climbing technique until I can climb outside again
Favorite stretching/mobility routines? I want to start doing some kind of routine on days I don’t climb that will help me be more flexible and mobile on the wall. As I’m progressing at climbing, I’m realizing that it’s often quite uncomfortable, if not impossible, for me to stay in good body position with my hips close to the wall when using high footholds. I could also use some extra mobility in the rest of my body too- watching the Japanese pros made me realize how important great mobility is for indoor bouldering. Does anyone have a good stretching routine for climbing?
Finger "pulp" problems This whole time, I've thought that my skin was causing my weak fingers/terrible endurance, but I'm realizing it's actually my finger "pulp." This is the only article I've found that addresses this:  [https://www.climbing.com/news/why-finger-pulp-not-tendon-strength-makes-for-better-crimping/](https://www.climbing.com/news/why-finger-pulp-not-tendon-strength-makes-for-better-crimping/) 

Does anyone else have this issue? My skin is fine. I almost never get flappers or splits, but after a few hard attempts, the tips of my fingers are throbbing and painful inside the tissue and I can't grip anything anymore. After years of slow, frustrating progress and thinking it was my crappy skin, I'm finally realizing this is my biggest block.

Anyone else have this issue? Any way to make it better? Do I just have to accept my genetics aren't made for climbing hard?
Good sport climbers: do you climb off of instincts or remembered beta? I tried a red-pointing a project a little while ago and noticed that I was making a lot of mistakes on the easier sections. It was a technical endurance route on slightly overhung terrain with a boulder crux at the end. The mistakes in the easier sections pumped my forearms too much to do the boulder. I could figure out the beta from the ground but would forget it while on the wall. It felt like I was on-sighting the route every time. Something about the pressure makes my mind foggy and forget the beta. I climb a lot better on slabby routes because I can just find my balance and figure out the beta on the wall.

Do you climb the easier sections of a sport route off your climbing instincts that you’ve built up over lots of mileage or do you somehow train your memory and remember all of the beta? In Adam Ondra’s Road to Tokyo #39, he can remember the beta for an entire route. Is his memory a gift or a skill climbers train? Any insight would be great.
Are treadwalls worth it For those of you who own or have access to treadwalls do you find it useful? 

I am a sport climber who just moved and I have no access to climbing. 

1. If you do not find it useful for you currently, is there a situation that you think one would be useful? 
2. When do you use it in your training? 
3. How often do you use it? 
4. Would you purchase a different piece of equipment to accomplish what you use the treadwall instead of a treadwall if you had the option?


Edit: 
I currently have a moonboard (haven't assembled it yet) and room to build a decent size spray wall). The tread wall would be in addition to good bouldering.
How to be a better climbing partner? Probably a strange question, but i think to be a better climbing partner and having a good relationship with your buddy is going to make your day on the crag better and probably help you send your project, because your mood is going to be more positive.

So what are the things you personally like about your partner and how a random climber at the crag can make your day better. Of course being generally a nice and kind person is always good, but we can take a look beyond personality. 

Of course a good belaying skills is a must.
Average Joe AMA A couple weeks ago, there was some discussion about an Average Joe AMA series.  This is the test run!  


I'm a real adult with a "real" job.  I train too much, and climb outside too little.  I'm a /r/climbharder mod, and I spend way too much time on reddit.  I've been climbing something like 17 or 18 years, and have been training consistently for the last 8ish.  I'm not quite 30 years old, and I hope to climb V13 by 40 and 5.13 by 50 (and 5.8 by 60!).

Ask Me Anything about working, climbing, training, moderating, data-nerding, etc.  


Post your questions here, and I'll get to all of them when I can, probably after work today.
Is “listening to your body” an effective way to prevent training/overuse injuries? I’ll chill at the gym and if I feel any sort of soreness I just wait a few more minutes until I feel ready to climb again.

I climbed two days in a row with very little rest in between climbs and was in extreme pain for two weeks. 

I’m wondering if I was to go more frequently but just take it super easy and only go when my body says I can if I’ll be ok.  I mean... they got WiFi at the gym so... I don’t mind resting a lot ya know?
Perhaps a silly question, but I want to know y'alls opinion. I have some buddies that are body-builders and I have actually taken a lot of training advice from them which has helped a lot with my climbing training and being really efficient with my training plans.  I was chatting with them about building certain physiques and I started wondering what would happen if you took the same body-building approach, but instead of lifting weights to target specific muscle groups, the only exercise you did was hard Moon boarding, or Tension boarding.  What would the Moon Board/ Tension Board body look like?  I'm always amazed at how the body responds to what you make it do, so this is just a thought that I had.  We came to the conclusion that you'd basically have very pronounced lats, posterior delts, and a less-defined chest.  Thoughts?
In Defense of Competition Climbing # Premise

With the explosion of growth in the general climbing scene and the evolution of competition climbing in recent years, there is a growing divide between ardent supporters of each discipline. There are many who feel that competition climbing has become a distinct entity from outdoor climbing, to the point where it can be viewed as a sport within itself due to the implementation of elements rarely, or never, found organically.

# Purpose

The goal of this post is to provide a different perspective on competition climbing and propose that every climber, regardless of whether or not one's goals include competing, should consider including at least some elements of the discipline to one's training. This is being done fully under the realization that due to the divisive nature of the subject at hand, inevitably there will be people with strong opinions for and against this, even after reading the post in its entirety. Hopefully discussion will be kept civil, and perhaps even productive!

# History

Before diving into specifics, an overview of competition climbing's history should provide some context for future discussion points.

Unlike most sports, climbing began in a non-competitive environment, with competition formats becoming an adaptation of the sport rather than the opposite. As such, it makes sense that the first international climbing competition, called Sportroccia, was held at an outdoor crag in Bardonecchia, Italy, in July 1985. Thousands were in attendance to watch many of the top climbers at the time, including a now-legendary routesetter named Jacky Godoffe, who placed 2^(nd) behind German climber Stefan Glowacz , with French climber Catherine Destivelle winning the women's division.

The following July, 1986, saw two other highly touted names competing: Lynn Hill and Ben Moon, both of whom finished 2^(nd) in their respective divisions in front of an audience of over ten thousand, including various European television stations with a strong media presence. 1986 also came with the introduction of the first indoor event organized by the French Federation of Mountaineering and Climbing (FFME) at a gymnasium in Vaulx-en-Velin.

All of this attention culminated with the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA) sanctioning the first Climbing World Cup in 1989. This movement was spearheaded by the FFME and Paul Brasset, the latter of whom began forming a division within the UIAA to define competition rules and train officials.

In 1990, the UIAA decided that international events would be held exclusively on artificial walls due to environmental impact. The following year, the first World Championship was hosted in Frankfurt, Germany. The next year brought the inclusion of the first Youth World Championship—a sign of the growing popularity of sport climbing, as lead climbing (difficulty) was the only recognized discipline at the time. This popularity increase culminated in the organization of the International Council for Competition Climbing (ICC) in 1997, which became the dedicated governing body of sport climbing as a division within the UIAA, for the purposes of guaranteeing sufficient autonomy and access to resources for growth and development. The next year saw the introduction of the speed climbing discipline, followed by bouldering in 1999.

2006 saw the first international paraclimbing competition take place in Ekaterinburg, Russia, for visually impaired athletes. This year also saw the UIAA ending its governance of competition climbing and support the creation of the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC), which was founded in January 2007. Its statutes and by-laws were adopted unanimously by the 57 federations involved with the IFSC's founding.

2007 was an important year, as it also came with provisional recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to the IFSC, which was definitively recognized in 2010.

In 2011, sport climbing was included on the short-list of possible new events for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics by the IOC Executive Board. This inclusion brought with it major exposure, further increasing international support.

Its confirmation as an event in Tokyo 2020 occurred in 2016, after the official proposition for sport climbing's inclusion in 2015 by the Tokyo 2020 Additional Event Programme Panel.

# What the Context Means

The IFSC, and therefore each nation's federation, have been aware of the potential for sport climbing's inclusion in the Olympics as early as 2011. The success of such an inclusion would be predicated on a number of factors, such as ease of understanding at a glance for the casual observer, the level of enjoyment derived from a beginner's understanding, visual aesthetic, and other factors related to retention and marketability. For these reasons alone, it isn't surprising to note why evolution of competition climbing's style occurred in the manner it did. To compare stylistic differences, consider Daniel Woods' ascent of M4 during Finals at the 2010 Teva Bouldering World Cup[^(\[1\])](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMKNqK44JdE) to Jernej Kruder's ascent of M2 during Finals at the 2018 Munich Bouldering World Cup.[^(\[2\])](https://youtu.be/rQwIy3KdilU?t=10448)

Japanese athletes started seeing major successes in international sport climbing beginning with Akiyo Noguchi in 2008 and Sachi Amma in 2009. As further funding increased and sport climbing's inclusion in the Olympics became more of a reality, the Japanese began dominating the bouldering and lead disciplines, particularly on the men's side. This makes sense given the 2020 Olympics occurring in Tokyo, where Japan will want to be able to claim all three available medals.

# Why the Stylistic Evolution is Positive

Beyond the obvious increase in exposure and continued inclusion in the Olympics, there are several reasons for such change being a good thing for the sport:

* emphasis on skill aspects of climbing increases;
* the likelihood for new grading benchmarks to be established increases;
* inherently subjective grading scales have reduced emphasis on determining success within climbing;
* failure on 'physically easier' problems occurs even in top climbers, making them more relatable for the average viewer;
* difficulty of climbing is easier to understand visually in comparison to hold size reduction for the average viewer;
* more options are viable for climbers looking to specialize in one discipline over another.

These reasons naturally have drawbacks from certain perspectives, but from the perspective of wanting the sport to succeed and grow, the positives outweigh the negatives.

# Why Everyone Should Incorporate Elements of Competition Style Into One's own Training

While not every 'competition style' move shows up outside, there is significant transferability from elements of complex movements to outdoor analogues, such as generating momentum from awkward positions, keeping body tension on exceedingly poor hand- and foot-holds, ability to fully commit on 'risky' moves, and a general increase in proprioception under many movement archetypes and combinations. It is no surprise that many of the top competition climbers are completing outdoor test-pieces very quickly, especially when considering the low level of outdoor volume compared to top outdoor climbers. Not only are the top competition climbers just as strong as the strongest outdoor climbers by important strength metrics, but many of them are better overall climbers by virtue of a higher skill component necessary to succeed in competition climbing, while simultaneously needing to maintain a high base level of strength.

It's important to remember that the 'parkour-style' movements found in international competitions are designed to challenge world-class climbers in a very specific way, and that the vast majority of climbers will be sufficiently challenged in the realms mentioned previously by highly distilled versions. Expecting to be able to complete identical movements would be like expecting the average gymnast to complete an olympic-level gymnast's routine in a discipline. The skill components and physical requirements would be too high, and the average gymnast would likely end up discouraged at best, and injured at worst. Since the vast majority of climbers lack proper coaching, the onus is on oneself to develop these skills as one would if beginning any new discipline to maximize safety, enjoyment, and performance increase.

It's not enough to view movement as a set of techniques, such as a backstep, or heel hook, or drop knee, once one is at a certain degree of mastery of climbing technique. Movement patterns need to be broken down to smaller constituents in order to see further progression and increase in understanding, both analytically and intuitively. Therein lies the major carryover from competition climbing into every aspect of climbing: one's degree of proprioception and movement exposure. Skills don't necessarily require high impact, either, and can be classified specifically under skill training, therefore preventing significant impact on recovery, particularly with skills emphasized on low-angle terrain, such as standing on especially poor foot holds and keeping a balanced position.

# Still not Convinced?

That's okay! One of the best parts of climbing is how inclusive it is with respect to number of available disciplines and the large differences between them. Climbing is inherently individual and diverse enough to cater to almost everyone in accordance with one's desired experience from the sport.

# In Conclusion

Competition climbing is still fundamentally climbing, and its inclusion as an olympic sport benefits almost every practitioner of the sport in some form regardless of one's chosen discipline. It has the potential to provide an environment where grades are no longer used to measure progress, failure becomes normalized, and skill development is easy to see occur.

25mins of ARCing in 25 seconds. Week 2 of my second winter season using the Anderson Brothers’ training cycle. Tonight was 3x25min ARCing with 10m breaks in between sets.
AMA - neuroscientist &amp; athletic trainer with a neurocentric approach **EDIT.** *closed so far. Another AMA coming up in a week or so.*

&amp;#x200B;

Hey guys,

Since I am sitting at home being sick for the day I thought I might just answer your questions. I come from med school and recently started a Ph.D. program in neuroscience.For 2 years I worked together with a physiotherapist on everyday people and climbers with a neurocentric approach. Meaning what does your brain need to do to create certain movements and what could possibly be a barrier higher up in the hierarchy. Like what role does vision play, how does your balance system play into all of this etc...From then on I focused a little bit more on climbers and recently started to train some people out of injury and improving performance. We are currently working on a branding so during the week I am in Ph.D. life and on the weekends I give training sessions.

Hope this is somewhat clear. Shoot me whatever you wanted to know about brains controlling movement and I try to answer the best I can.
Need some feedback from my fellow strong climbers Would you pay to have access to a smaller, training facility in addition to your current gym membership?  It would be a smaller facility dedicated to training and catered to strong climbers.  There would be no commercial bouldering or ropes.

It would have all the training tools you could possibly need.  Moon, Tension, Kilter boards.  Steep spray board.  Open 24/7 for members only with a key card.  This would be ideal for those times that your normal commercial gym is packed with kids, or when you just want to be around only strong climbers and get some serious training done wthout extra bullshit.  Roughly $20/mo so it wouldn't break the bank to keep your existing gym membership.  Members could come and go as they please.  Show up at 2am if you want, brew a fresh pot of coffee.  Climb hard.  Members can set new hard problems on the spray board periodically.  plenty more details, but just trying to get an idea of if there is a market for this kind of thing as I've been hearing my climbing buddies constantly complain about commercial gyms. This gym would not be enjoyable for anyone who isn't interested in getting stronger.  If you think you'd enjoy something like this, can you just put that in the comments?
Lock off or throw? If I can do the move both ways, what are the pros and cons of locking off and stabbing for a dead point verses throwing for a dead point? To me it feels like locking off is more strenuous but my accuracy is better when I lock off. I'm curious what other people think and what other considerations there are.
Toes pain after a climbing session Is it normal that my toes harts after a climbing session? I recently bought new shoes but they fit me very well.

Btw: i am posting a lot of questions in this sub and i always get helpful responses. So that you.
Does diet really make a difference for the non elite? Interested to hear any scientific or anecdotal evidence that diet is a **significant** factor when it comes to training at the non elite levels. Ive been climbing about 4 years and seen steady but not earth shattering progress. I know a good diet is never a bad thing, but **I want to get a feeling if the effort in change of lifestyle is worth it when it comes to climbing performance.** I climb semi seriously (\~3 times per week, trying to work in strength and power endurance specifics etc), but I don't see the appeal in calorie counting and doing "my macros" (I don't even know what this means).

I consider myself very fortunate in that for the past 10 years I have basically eaten whatever I wanted without limits, and not seen any significant change in body composition (likely due to playing other sports, high metabolism). I would say I get a couple of portions of fruit and veg a day and probably enough protein from milk since I normally have about 3 bowls of cereal a day. Aside from that, I eat loads of sugar (sweets, chocolate, some soft drinks), loads of coffee, not that much water. Overall, not great, but I could probably do a lot worse if i really wanted to.

I'm late 20s, 182cm/6ft, 83kg/183lbs, I haven't measured body fat but i would guess its around 13-15%, currently projecting sport F6c-7a range.

Sorry if this comes across as a "idiot" thing to ask if the answer is obviously "YES", but I feel it's worth asking as I couldn't find a relevant discussion and I'm naturally skeptical. I've tried looking in the Wiki and the sub for answers on this but nothing was obvious, welcome pointers to other threads and literature.
TrainingBeta Hacked? I signed up for TrainingBeta’s bouldering training last night and this morning am getting redirected to a Russian bitcoin site. I got a warning from google that this site is trying to take financial information. Is anyone else having this issue or is it an isolated event on my end? 

Bummed cause I really wanted to get started on Day 1 today! 😆
Question for climbers on youth sport teams I’m 16, climb v9 /5.12 , and am on the the youth team on my gym.  But I’ve. Always felt like we didn’t do enough to train technique or strength on my team, and I want some opinions

During the entire bouldering season , we pretty much exclusively did “made up boulders” and floor core.  I obviously try to do workouts and such in my own times,  but are workouts something most people do in their youth team practices? My team itself is decent overall, but  idk

I’m basically asking what other team climbers typically do in practices, and if it seems to help them a lot.  I was inspired to ask this after being at a comp where a very significant number of the extremely level climbers were on the same team.
Goal for 2020 I started climbing february 2019, and since this summer I've been climbing quite seriously (around 3 times per week). I am able to project 6C and can send it in a couple of weeks. I am 21, 67 kg, 172 cm tall, and eat healthy.

I have read that one progresses slower and slower as you climb the grade ladder, so I need advise to set a realistic grade goal for 2020. I want to be able to project 7A quite reliably. Is that too ambitious or too easy? Thanks

Edit: changed 7a to 7A. I only, really, boulder.
What’s your 2020 climbing goal? How are you going to achieve it? Merry christmas and happy new year. Forever grateful for the climbing community!
How to train for roofs Pretty self explanatory.  I climb 2 or 3 grades worse when I am trying roofs.  How can I bring that up
What do you think is the best proportion between volume and limit bouldering. What do you guys experienced more improvement with, more volume bouldering when you go for problems you can do within 3 tries or project hard stuff.

I'm confused, because i think it helps me when i climb some moonboard 6B+'s and 6C's but on the other hand how are we supposed to start doing harder moves if we don't really practise them with limit bouldering (for me somewhere in the 7A's range).
How to apply 3-finger drag in actual climbing Recently I've been working on higher rated climbs indoors (v7-v9) where there is a need to latch smaller edges (single pad or less) dynamically/via a deadpoint.  

I've realized that I more or less never use 3FD in actual climbing, though I have begun training it on the hangboard in addition to half-crimp.  My default grip on the wall is usually a mixture of open crimp (4 fingers on with 3/4 hyperextended), and half-crimp (all 4 hyperextended).  These have served me well thus far but I have had my fair share of pulley a4/a2 injuries, as well as some mild PIP joint pain.

I do realize there have been threads about 3FD before -- i'm more so wondering how to actually apply it in practice on the wall.  Do most advanced climbers here try to latch things at speed with 3FD, and then convert into a crimp before moving to the next hold?  Doesn't the "conversion" waste energy? (but i guess it comes with the benefit of more safety for your pulleys)  Does hitting the hold with 3FD make you more likely to slip off? I feel like my "contact strength" is much better going with 4 fingers at once.

On the campus board, why do most people train with crimp grip instead of 3FD?  the campus board seems like the perfect use case for utilizing 3FD to me..

TLDR: should I be making most of my dynamic moves to small edges with 3 finger drag ?  this seems to be the safest, but i'm not sure if it's the most effective.

  I realize that it's obviously not a "one-size-fits-all" solution, for different styles of holds 3FD might be better, or worse, than half-crimp.  But since I basically \*NEVER\* use 3FD period, I feel that I must be missing something.
Looking for feedback on simple trainings protocol After a very success full year (first 7a (super short, vertical, but quite continuous) and first long 6a+ and 6b sport multipitches) I would like to push it a little further.

Goals:

\- Another 7a, but now in Belgium were I never yet climbed harder then 6b. They grade pretty stiff over there.

\- Alpine multipitch up to grade VI in the Dolomites, this is mostly a mental issue.

\- Training 3 times a week, instead of just 2.

Some background

Long history of Alpine stuff and rock climbing at not a very high level. Serious about rock the last 4-5 years. Not the youngest anymore at 54, but mostly quite healthy. I live in one of the flatest countries on earth, but Belgium is a 2-3 hour drive and the Alps 10-12 hour.

Weak points: 

\- Mental, I quickly frighten above a bolt, am afraid to head into unknown territory. On trad all this gets a bit worse. Especially bad when it is not a slab.

\- Not a lot of upper body strength. I am very skinny, 65 kg at 1.86

\- Not much endurance on very steep stuff.

So here is my training plan. I'm afraid I am not the right kind of guy for a very regimented protocol, so I keep this utterly simple.

One day bouldering, volume. For example all the orange and pink boulders in the gym at a running pace. that is about 30 boulders at an easyish onsight level. Later on extending into the black ones which are more difficult for me to flash.

One day toprope/leading in the gym. Seeking out as much overhanging walls as the pump allows.

One day limit bouldering. Seeking out the overhanging stuff. Also seeking out really hard for me boulders as I tend to avoid that.

As soon as spring arrives going to Belgium as often as possible, concentrating on projecting but also doing harder multipitches. Projecting is something I have been avoiding so far. This would replace one bouldering session.

Does this seem plausible? Any extra excercises I could mix in?
Training less worked for me I have been climbing for 10+ years, bouldering only. I am the guy that just climbs, hits a plateau and stays there for years. After my last outdoor trip, I knew I wanted to get serious about training.
All previous efforts to train failed. This had several reasons. For one, I wanted to have a training program that covered all aspects. I have learned that this is impossible and does not work. It leads to a program that is too bloated and difficult to follow. Second, as a result, I could not finish all workouts. I quit before I was done. This led to a low motivational state. I have gotten to understand that actually completing a few workouts properly leads to a very satisfied feeling about the training session. Third, the workouts did not pay off. They were not done consistent, no focus, low quality and not high enough intensity. I learned to go for a few workouts with high focus, good quality and really high intensity. The satisfied feeling afterwards makes it easier to be consistently doing the training program. 
To cover all aspects of climbing training, I now cycle through a handful of workouts I think I can benefit from every 4 to 6 weeks.
A lot of my insights have come from information I found on this sub. Thank you all for giving me the means to break my plateau!

What has been your most important insight of last year?
I sent 8c+ this year, relevant physical condition revealed below. AMA Hi,

There are discussions here about correlations between basic specific exercises and yield in effective climbing. I found many cool and useful tips here from you folks and the correct step is to give something back. Maybe it helps.The plan for this year was different but eventually I decided I will try a beautiful 8c+ sport route until I would get back on my 9a project.

Part of this decision is influenced by the Lattice Team's feedback after collaborating a while.

Background: 16 years climbing, 8b+ sport on rock, 8B boulder indoor. Non-professional, 8h deskjob.

I think too much information will lead to misinterpretation so I will write down the strengths in terms of exercises as just raw details.

&amp;#x200B;

* Beastmaker 2000 lowest middle edge (*23mm*) one arm hang (bent arm) for \~4 seconds:- half crimp: no extra weight- 4 finger open hand: no extra weight- 3 finger drag: added 30kg (\~135%)
* Campus board (*With varying woodtypes and other factors excused I dare to say standard specifications: homemade rounded 25 cm flat rungs, 22cm distance, 15 degree incline*)- 1-5-8 maxladder, best attempt was touching rung 8.5.

To draw a hasty conclusion would be that 1-5-8 on a standard campus board and 130% bodyweight \~4 second hang on a decent edge (*like the 23mm on the BM2000*) shows easily enough pulling power and finger strength for at least 8c. These are among the hardest to train and also the most impacting.But this year I had to put in conscious effort into the will to endlessly try impossible moves until they become possible. This was one of those rare positive impacts in climbing, but it is in fact tiring; mentally exhausting to keep telling yourself to pull maximally hard with some expectations but zero reward. Until you eventually start getting the first bit of reward, then it is game on from there.

That is what 8c+ taught me in 2019.
Returning climber after a double-digit lay-off seeking your advice for 2020 Climb Hardians,

Returning climber here, after a big double digit break. My first ever Reddit post. I've been back a year now bouldering and absolutely loving it. It has changed my life. Again! I'm looking for advice in planning my 2020.

Useful info upfront:

\- Currently climbing V6/V7 indoors according to my gym, with the occasional V8 but I think the grading is soft. Pre lay-off I was climbing (actual) V7. I've been outdoors at the tail end of this year and sent V5, and played on moves of some V6/7's without linking up. I've always had good technique, hence the fairly quick return to past form, which has really surprised me. I'm hitting 40 next year and I'm at 78kg/185cm. I could probably lose 2/3kg but I feel that should be a result of just continuing to train (I lost roughly 4kg of fat and gained perhaps 2kg muscle in 2019).

\- I have a young family, which (by my own choice) limits climbing in my evenings. Bouldering is my passion, but reading bedtime stories is something I'll only get to do once. That has left me fitting in intense lunchbreak sessions in the working week, which I've amped up to 4-a-week as 2019 rolled by. 15 mins warm-up followed by 45 mins targeted climbing.

\- Generally I climb volume up to flash Mon/Thurs and limit bouldering on the 45d system board/hard boulders Tues/Friday. Weds is a rest day and the weekend is spent with the family.

\- I do sometimes get out one evening in the week perhaps once a month. The focus here is on fun/volume with friends shooting the breeze, because time pressure is less. Due to my weekly routine, power massively drops off after an hour, but I try to last three hours if possible.

\- I'm hoping to get outdoors bouldering every other month in 2020. I'd like to send/consolidate V6 and project some V7's that inspire me.

\- My major limiting factors are time spent climbing, finger strength and power. I tend to climb slowly and in complete control as I love the movement, but it's likely efficiency gains could be made. Finger strength and power is the long game, so I know there are no shortcuts here. I have very little of what I used to have, strength wise and instead have far greater commitment and motivation.

&amp;#x200B;

With that out of the way, in 2020 do I:

\- Do more of the same for a year, and consolidate. Still have the same limiting factors, but more base.

\- Add in beastmaker 1k workouts two late evenings a week to try and get more overall time to try and address LF's. Can I do climbing at lunch and BM on the same day and keep three rest days a week to recover? Is that inadvisable? I gave the Beastly 5a routine a shot and completed it fairly easily last week, so I have the right conditioning to begin on the hangboard.

\- Build a home system board to try and eek out perhaps two or three evening sessions a week, late at night. Probably wouldn't be until mid year due to available funds but I have the space. Am I jumping the gun here? It would certainly help me develop more time climbing.

&amp;#x200B;

Really appreciate people taking the time to read all of that. I've lurked here for a few months and it's been a real source of inspiration and psyche.

Thanks, everyone.
Has anyone built a version of Dave MacLeod's Powerstation? (new to climbing) **I have seen alternatives using 2x4's but I like this one as it is wider and allows more options including two sides. I am building this for my wife. Any advice, tips/tricks on this 'specific' station would be appreciated.I figure I will make it about 7.5' in height and 4' in widthWhat type of plywood would you recommend? (4' wide, 2.5' height)I cannot see how he built the legs on the bottom (with the covering of the plywood)**

**Did he use t nuts to secure the plywood to the posts? I think I will need a 6" bolt for all four?**

**Finally, how would I rig this setup to be used with a harness? There is a neat tutorial on YouTube on how a guy rigged his own with weights on the outside of the station:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxOq1XVCv0Q**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxOq1XVCv0Q)

How to get in the right mindset to send your project? Alright. Some background. I am mostly an indoor climber, because I live in The Netherlands. So this will be about my indoor lead goals. 

Halfway of 2019 I set a goal for this year. By the end of the year I wanted to have done my first 7a lead climb. This seemed a good challenge but possible for me. But nearing november I was still struggling to go through 6c/6c+. So I "gave up" on my goal, thinking: going one grade up in one month is highly unlikely.

I climb with a regular group of people and we are roughly in the same grade, some a bit higher, some a bit lower. All of a sudden we started to project a 7a+ route last week. I joined in and it felt like a route within my limits. I toproped it a few time to get familiar with the route (and not have to deal with my slight fear of leadfalls) but yesterday I gave it a shot leadclimbing the route. It went quite well, with only 2 falls at my crux move.

Tonight I have my last indoor session of this year. And I am stoked to send this route and actually reaching my goal for this year when I send it. But I know sending it will be about the mindset and keeping calm. Do you guys and girls have any tip to get in the right mindset that helps me to send this project? (or any project in the future).

TL;DR. How do I get in the right mindset to send my 7a project in my last climbing session of this year? And with sending this route, completing my 2019 goal of sending my first 7a leadclimb by the end of the year.
Should you scream? What does your try-hard noise say about your efficiency of movement? Describe some of the prescriptive differences in oxygen consumption and raw power output between climbers who scream and those who grunt or strain.
Splitting time between bouldering and top rope Kinda basic question...
I'm fairly new and in no way looking for a training plan or am I out chasing grades. Nothing against this idea but I'm still so new that I'm trying to figure out what my goals even are outside just staying on the wall. 
 
 If I understand, top rope helps with endurance and bouldering for strength in it's most basic explanation of what it does for fitness? Is there a good way to do both and benefit both or am I going to have to pick one as my "primary" at some point
Training for a V7 on a Moonboard by the end of 2020. Hey guys. My 2020 climbing is to send a Moonboard V7. I know focusing on grades can be detrimental but I need a clear goal to focus on. 

A little background... I have been climbing for a little over a year. In that time I went from being able to do V2s to snagging a few V6 problems. I have gained strength rather fast for how often I climb (once a week). I have noticed that my foot work is awful and holds me back greatly. 

So what exercises and technique drills should I practice? Also, what is a solid V7 Moonboard problem that I could work? What foods should I eat? 

I’m also a 17M
current set up- added parallel bars up top for higher volume core/scapula/pull work when fingers have had enough. will be adding 2.25” rubber sleeves onto the top bars to keep the forearms engaged throughout, and ill call it done.
Coaches say you don't need to hangboard until climbing at least 5.12/v6, that up until that point all you need is technique. Is there any evidence this is true? There is evidence that better climber across all ability levels climb more efficiently, have faster recovery, and, you guessed it, stronger grip. These findings, to me, do not support the claim that "finger strength isn't the problem" if you can't climb 5.12. It tells me *both* technique *and* finger strength are the two reasons why anyone can or cannot climb 5.12.

Is there evidence out there, one way or the other, whether this is a myth or actual good advice?
Homemade finger training tool! Made the perfect gift my climbing friends this Christmas. Hang weights from the bottom, and use either the 15mm, 10mm, 8mm, or 5mm slots 👌
Building a program: winter training for 12d/13a in 2020 **tl;dr** - mid 5.12 climber hoping to break into 12d/13a next year, what's the best foundation to build between now and April?

As 2019 ends I'm trying to put together a solid training plan for this winter/early spring, with the goal of sending my first 12d or 13a in the next year. I've identified a couple of candidate routes in my area for that first 13a as well as routes to build out the pyramid below that. (Routes I'm considering for SLC locals--open to suggestions here: Teardrop at AF, Wicked Bender at Echo, Tacos Diablos in LCC.)

**Where I'm at**: in 2019, I went from having sent two (outdoor) 12a sport climbs in 2018 to doing three additional 12as (including one onsight), a 12a/b, a 12b, and a 12b/c. (I also came extremely close to sending a solid 12c but injured a tendon during a redpoint attempt.) Many of these routes were done in just a few tries and none felt like they were at my limit, hence my itch to shoot for a 5.13 this coming year. 

I boulder (indoors) v7-ish pretty consistently in a few tries to a session and put down the odd v8 in 1-2 sessions at my gym, and have done some v7 and a couple soft v8 moonboard benchmarks. I don't have much in the way of current strength benchmarks but the last time I did any consistent hangboarding (in early 2019) I could hang 140% of BW on a 20mm edge for 10s, and I can probably do about 10-12 good form pull-ups. I usually climb about 3 days per week, mostly bouldering and some leading.

**Strengths and weaknesses**: I am generally good at boulders and cruxes featuring small crimps on vertical to moderately overhung (say &lt;20 degrees) terrain. I think I have pretty good footwork and speed/pacing relative to other climbers at my grade. My lead head is pretty good on redpoint attempts, though I struggle to commit on longer, pumpy onsight attempts and have some fear around clipping off of slopey holds. I tend to struggle on compression moves, slopers and slopey pinches, large dynamic moves that require full-body coordination, and roofs. I would say I have below-average route endurance and struggle to rest effectively on overhung terrain unless I can get a kneebar/armbar or some other trickery. Finally, my work capacity is lower than I would like--I feel like I can typically give three quality burns on outdoor routes at/near my working grade (maybe four on a good day or a particularly short route) before I'm too tired for solid tries.

Accordingly, my harder outdoor sport redpoints have tended to be slightly overhanging, shorter crimpfests in which I can speed through the difficulties to the anchors or at least a good rest.

**My tentative plan**: my plan is to do three training days per week, with an optional fourth day. I ski one to two days per week during winter, so my planned schedule is Tuesday/Wednesday/Friday, with an optional day on Sunday as ski conditions and life responsibilities allow.

Monday: rest

Tuesday: strength day - warmup, boulder to flash level, then two strength circuits--I'm thinking something like (max hang - bench press - squats) and (pinch blocks - weighted pull-ups - deadlift). Finish with core work.

Wednesday: route fitness and work capacity day - warmup; lead or autobelay a large volume of routes around my onsight level (mid to upper 5.11). Shoot for at least 10 pitches to start and build over time. This would be aimed at maintaining/improving my lead head and building endurance and work capacity; as spring approaches I'm thinking I would transition this day towards working power endurance, either on routes or boulder circuits.

Thursday: rest

Friday: power day - warmup, boulder to flash level, limit boulder on v8-9 or harder routes, aiming to find hard 2-5 move sequences that take more than one session to link. Focus on routes on steep terrain, avoid straightforward crimp problems.

Saturday: skiing or rest day

Sunday: skiing, rest day, or optional climbing day - either project or onsight routes or boulders. I might occasionally repeat the strength day routine this day if I'm feeling strong and motivated, but don't want the plan to hinge on it.

**Questions**: 

1. Is a strength routine with max hangs just once a week enough stimulus to be worthwhile? Should I include max hangs on Friday before/after limit bouldering?

2. Should I consider campus training instead of or in addition to limit bouldering (obviously not in combination with max hangs on the same day)? 

3. Is my endurance/work capacity/lead head day hopelessly unfocused and a waste of time? If so, what should I do instead?

4. Am I doing something else stupid here?

Thanks for reading and any advice!
What are your goals for 2020? I'll start:

1.  No injuries that keep me from climbing
2.  Heal my left shoulder fully
3.  At least 5 sport climbing trips
4.  Send 12b
5.  Introduce roof sessions once a week (will measure via journal)

Edit:  I will remind everyone here in 6 months.
Sport Climber here - how can I get good weekly volume from just climbing if I only have a belayer once a week? Having a belayer has long been the thing holding me back from "just climbing". Last year I realized that getting a belayer more than 2x week was nearly impossible, and since then, my most reliable belay partner has started emphasizing bouldering more dropping me down to 1 reliable belay per week.

Because of this, I've seen a definite flat line in my climbing progress dating back to last year this time since once a week is simply not enough to get better from climbing alone. I'd love 3x week but that seems out of reach right now. Though I'm only climbing at 11.c gym redpoint level (V4 and occasional 5 boulder) I feel this is pushing me more into adding volume through other means such as ARC training, bouldering circuits, and repeater workouts.

Is this the right thinking? what should I do if I can only reliably get 1 good sport leading session per week?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you all for so many thoughtful responses and potential training activities. You guys are the freakin best. I've been limited by lack of belay resources but there have been so many good suggestions for routines on the boulder wall and systems walls, I'm not even worried about it now!
Ideas for different ways to train by climbing? Especially on easier grades? Got a list would like suggestions. So I’m working on a v3 in my gym. And I’m pretty sure just going after it and only it obsessively is not the most effective way to train.  But when I climb on lower grades I’m not exactly sure what I should be practicing.

So... I’ve got a couple ideas but would like feedback/additions/subtractions: 

- keeping hips close to wall
- climb with the legs
- practice “back stepping”
- climb slowly and try to be in as much control as possible
- speed climbing?
- find multiple ways up the same route
- keep weight under your arms, especially on slopers
- practice staying on toes on all footholds for better pivoting abilities?
- climb easier grades one after the other with little rest to build endurance?

- ???? Any other techniques or anything people like to do?
Writing journal/notebook Hi y’all, I’m starting a journal for climbing. For those who are experienced with writing journals and notebooks for climbing, I was wondering what is a must have when writing about your climbing training, climbing days, etc? Thanks in advance!
/r/GripTraining is hosting a 1 Arm Dead Hang challenge for the month of January! #The 1-Arm Dead Hang for Time:

Happy 2020 everyone! This month /r/GripTraining is running a bodyweight challenge: **[One Arm Dead Hang for Max Time](https://www.reddit.com/r/GripTraining/comments/eiq38t/january_challenge_1_arm_dead_hang_for_time_2020/)**. Come on over and submit a video! Rules are lax, and prizes are involved. Open and female categories.

#The Rules:

* Using a pull-up bar of any size, material, or texture. Any other hangling implement must be cleared by the judges. Hangboards are ok, rings are not.

* Use a[1-handed grip on the bar](http://i.imgur.com/7D1lQWH.jpg?1), with or without the thumb. Overhand, neutral grip, or underhanded grip is fine, and you may rotate around during the event. Slight variations on the hang are permitted (bent elbows, etc), as long as they don't cause you to violate the other rules. 

* Time starts when your weight is exclusively supported by only one hand on the bar. Your time finishes when you support your weight with something else, your non-working hand assists you, or your working hand leaves the bar. This time becomes your score.

* Your entire body must be in shot the whole time. If this is violated at any point, the judges may rule your attempt as "finished" at that point in the video.

* Chalk is allowed.

* You may submit and resubmit as many times as you like before the end of the month.

* Check out the [last dead hang challenge and results here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GripTraining/comments/7o0f4k/january_challenge_1_arm_dead_hang_for_time/).

What did you wish you knew when you started climbing? Hey I’m a new climber and I was wondering if people had some wisdom to share and what you wish you knew when you started rock climbing.
Predictions for the next decade of climbing Hey, i thought it might be fun to see what your predictions for the next decade of climbing are.

I'm thinking of predictions in the numbers (what grades will be reached), changes to ethics and style, changes to training and to trainingequipment, ...

I'm posting this here because i'm not interested in predictions of when Climbing VIP X will marry and/or other r/climbing bingo items but if you think it's not a good fit, feel free to downvote/remove my post.
A 2019 Goal-Setting year review for helping set better goals in 2020 **2019 Climbing Goals year in review:**

I feel like every year I get a little better at setting goals, and using them to direct and improve my climbing. Because of that, I figured I’d sit down and spray a little about my goals for last year, what they taught me, and how I’m using my experience in chasing those goals to inform my goals for 2020 so I can become a better and stronger climber. I hope others can get something out of this, or have suggestions for different goals/goal setting approaches etc.

**Overview:**

2019 was a big and complex year for me. Starting a new job, losing my main climbing partner (my brother moving for work), changing goals and priorities half-way through the year, and hurting my elbow, then my fingers were all significant limitations that I didn’t foresee when I set my goals, and which made an impact on what I was able to achieve in 2019. Despite that, I feel like this was a hugely important year for my improvement as a climber, since I feel like I learned an incredible amount in pretty much all areas of my climbing life this year.

**The Goals and how I did:**

I set some lofty goals in 2019, mostly based on a desire for big numbers, and a feeling that I might be able to just barely achieve those goals. This was a year that I wanted to be bold with my goals, and hopefully really push myself to new levels. A lot of the goals I set were based around the idea that this year would be focused primarily on bouldering, and I wouldn’t set any specific goals for sport climbing as I’d done the previous year. This goal changed priority half-way through the year, which had a ripple effect on the outcomes for these goals. 

*Major Goals for 2019:*

- Send V11 ❌

- V9x5  ✅

- V8x10 ❌(Partial Fail, only sent 7 new ones)

- Flash V7 ✅(Flashed 2!)

- 5.13a ❌

- Not suck at sport climbing ✅(sorta?)

Of these goals, I’m most proud of the V7 flashes, and completing the V9’s goal. Last season I’d nearly flashed like 5 different V7’s, getting them on my second attempt once I had beta, so it was really satisfying to prove to myself that I could actually flash the right boulders if I was focused. I am also pleased with how the volume based goals helped to focus my efforts, and what I chose to spend time working. I am pretty certain that I could have finished up the V8’s goal if I had spent as much time bouldering as I had originally planned, but completing the V9’s goal proves that I wasn’t wasting time on those harder boulders, and was still able to build out some amount of a base for my pyramid. 

I’m most disappointed in not being able to complete my goal of sending 5.13a. I know for certain that I can climb the grade, but I did a poor job of time and mini-goal management, so wasn’t able to pull one off. I did a poor job of sticking to a good training program, and did a poor job getting on, then back on routes of this grade. 

As for the other goals, V11 was certainly lofty, and probably only would have been a “maybe” if I had not been injured, and had totally dominated the other sub goals. I did get on a couple of the grade, but they were all significantly further away than made sense to spend time working. I do actually think that I made a couple of significant steps this year in learning how to not suck at sport climbing. I don’t know if I can say I don’t suck, but I feel like I know better how to train, time, plan, and prioritize my goals for sport climbing. I also learned to really love sport climbing, which I think is the most important part of that goal. I learned what makes it fun, and I learned how to tap into that so I can enjoy the process.

**How do I use this to inform my goals for 2020?**

This year once again validated the importance of volume-based grade goals for bouldering. I think the most important part, is that working to complete this goal will always have some element of success, whether you hit the goal or not. Setting a max grade goal that I wasn’t able to complete was actually more useful than I expected. It forced me to keep an open mind to my performance max, to not settle, and to be very aware of my current weaknesses and limitations. I don’t think I would have cared so much about fixing my weaknesses, if I hadn’t set this goal, and felt so far away from completing it.  Working to complete my sport climbing goals proved to me the importance of volume in sending new routes. Doing a lot of new sport routes teaches me a ton, and requires setting more specific mini-goals that need to be completed, and this will add up over a season to being able to send the hard grades that I want to complete. Setting a “feelings” based goal usually goes against all the recommendations of goal setting, but I actually liked it more than I thought. There isn’t a number to reach or chase, there isn’t some single performance that needs to be achieved, you get to be reflective and honest with yourself at the end of the year while reviewing, and deciding if you’ve met that goal or not. Chasing a feeling can also make you work harder, and care more about the larger picture, which I think can be a good tool for becoming a better climber long-term.

**Goals for 2020:**

With all that said, these are the goals for my climbing that I would like to complete:

- Send V11

- Send 5.13a

- Send 100 new sport routes

- V10x3

- V9x9

- Get STRONG shoulders

- Not suck at sport climbing

- Stick to a training plan/program to match seasons and priorities.
Setting a spray wall. I am setting a spray wall in my house and i was wondering if you guys had any tips with regards to dispersion of holds and orientation. Ive noticed that most of the limit style boards tend to have the majority of the holds horizontal.

The board is 45deg
Slopers causing wrist pain, any advice on how to strengthen wrists welcome I (23F) have been bouldering for just over a year and am now mostly climbing up to V4 and projecting some V5s. I like and am good at crimpy climbs, I can hold on to crimps happily and my highest grade flashes and V5 climbs have been crimpy. 

However, the problem comes when I try slopers my wrists become very very painful if I try too hard on them. I think it's something to do with the bones in my wrists separating out, but I don't really know what to do to make it better. I first started experiencing this pain months ago, and as my wrists started hurting just twisting my wrists, I stopped really trying many climbs involving slopers hoping the pain would go away
 
Basically, the advice of "just climb more slopers" isn't what I'm looking for, as it hurts, so if anyone can contribute any other exercises they've found has helped with this or similar problems I'd be incredibly grateful.
New climber, need advice So unfortunately I didn’t catch the climbing bug until later in life, I’m 44 and have only been climbing nine months. But I’m totally hooked and trying hard to get better. Currently 5.10 top rope in the gym and outside, 5.9 outside sport lead. 

So here’s the question. What percentage of time do you guys recommend I spend climbing hard (at the top end or slightly above my level) versus climbing a grade or two below my level and focusing on technique.  I have read over and over that beginners should spend the bulk of their time doing the latter, but the guys I climb with all do the former only and seem to be progressing more quickly than me. I am climbing three, sometimes four, days per week. One of those is almost all bouldering.  On the two route days I am doing spending about 90% of my time focusing on footwork, body positioning and so on On 5.8 and 5.9 routes.  But everyone I climb with just wants to climb stuff they fall off of a bunch of times, and they sure seem to be getting better faster.  Am I overthinking the technique and just need to man up and fall more, or will this approach serve me better in the long run?   


Thanks in advance.
How did you injure yourself climbing? Hey all, newer climber here. So you hear about climbing injuries all the time since they're fairly common, but as somebody who is a newer climber, I'm curious to know what you did to cause your own injuries?

Was your injury traumatic or chronic? What kind of move was it? Or did it happen over time?

Finger, elbow, shoulder, back, hips, hamstring, let's hear them all!

Edit: I have completely underestimated how many comments I would get. Trying to respond to them all! Appreciate you guys all sharing! Some common themes such as not warming up are appearing.

Edit: chronic* not chromatic
Technique improvement for an advanced climber (V10) Hello friends. I am the classic case of getting strong pretty quick but not gaining technique in the process. I climbed my first outdoor V10 about two years ago, and since then, I have gotten so much stronger, although I have not made major improvements on my grades outdoors. Since then, I have become a much more consistent climber, climbing multiple V10's (8), and my first V11 a couple weeks back, albeit soft. I believe with my benchmarks on hang board, front lever, campus board, and pull-ups I should be climbing harder than I currently am. This is also coupled by every V10 I have done has been done in one session and feels way below my limit, but alas, I have not conquered the elusive 8a's yet (not consistent). My benchmark for the hang board is a 15 second one arm (one time I hit 20 s) three-finger hang on the middle-lower rung of the beatmaker 2000. For front levers, I have gotten it up to a consistent 15-second hang with good form. For the campus board, I just recently hit 1-5-8 for the first time on the small Metolius rungs with standard spacing the other day. I can do 4 one-arm pull-ups on my right arm and 3 on my left. How do you guys suggest gaining technique to be able to climb harder grades? Although I am nowhere near as strong, Hoseok Lee reminds me of myself. Extremely strong, but because of strength, I lack heavily in technique. I have been told that the volume of outdoor climbs below my limit is what will make me better. What do you guys think?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I know this sounds like bragging but I am really not trying to. I want to improve my climbing. I love you and thank you for your time! Oh and if it helps I am 5'8'' with a +0 ape index. Thanks!!
Max Hangs and Weighted Pullups on the same day? I was thinking about starting a max hang protocol and adding it on the same day that I do my weighted pullups and core exercises. I would definitely take at least one rest day after this training day before doing a climbing session. 

Is this a good idea from an injury and performance standpoint?
University rock climbing club vs Local mountaineering clubs (Southwest England)? Probably not perfect place for this topic but i find this good place for open discussion.

 I'm moving country for a job and sadly losing my social group of rock climbing friends. I've taken a job at a university and am thinking about joining a rock climbing club as a social avenue.  I've never been involved with a club and simply started out by dragging some friends climbing with and just evolved from that. Because i'm joining a University i have the option of joining the uni's club but do worry about any dissonance between a staff member and students but i'm not overly concerned with this. The other option i have is the mountaineering club. This club seems a bit more outdoor  sport and trad climbing orientated and is probably where i want push myself as i spend far too much time in the bouldering gym.

I imagine there are quite a few climbers that have been involved in both kinds of clubs and thought i'd ask their opinion on them. Which is the more social, which do/did you enjoy more, which did you gain the most from as a climber?
Advice on achieving a decade long goal. Hi I have a few questions about training and climbing when it comes to weightlifting. I am 230lbs 6'3" (im shrinking :( ) 30m . Wall of text incoming:

TLDR: am I wasting my time?

Edit: I want to do this outside.

Edit2: Sorry 2nd edit I am interested in doing both v10 and 5.14 outside, this is the goal. I wrote this on my lunch break and was not reading carefully enough.  

I use to be a very serious powerlifter, I trained for 12 years in powerlifting but have been weightlifting since I was 12. I had very big lifts when I was training at my heaviest (350lbs). I have kept a lot of my strength considering the amount of time I've taken off from powerlifting. I can still deadlift over 400lbs and I can shrug over 500+ lbs for reps, you get the idea I am strong. With all of these things in mind should I keep training for pulls ups, muscle ups, max hangs, hangboarding, one arm hangs, one arm pullups and powerlifting/bodybuilding? I think that if I stop training specifically for strength in the gym and change over to only a climbing routine my tendons will be better off and I will see more progress on the wall. I currently climb gym v4's very consistently and projecting some v5's when the style is correct. I mostly do ropes however, (walls are short) I can climb gym 5.12s with only a few attempts.

I lift 5x a week and climb 3x a week. I do 4x4s on the steepest top rope wall my gym offers for my cardio, again very short walls at my gym.

I have been climbing for roughly over a year and I would like to continue my training to progress in climbing rather than bodybuilding/powerlifting.  I set very tangible goals for myself in powerlifting and I shattered them because I will train like a crazy person and get obsessed about things and want to plan exactly how I do things as efficiently as possible. I want to climb a v10 and 5.14 by the time I am 40.

I also have about 15lbs of fat to lose before I would not consider myself chubby.  This weight is being lost now.

With that in mind I would be climbing at 215lbs. I plan on losing a few pounds a year trending towards my lightest weight of 190lbs-180lbs. With this in mind is it possible to feasibly reach my climbing goals of sending hard v10s+ and 5.14s? I am very serious about training and I honestly would like feedback and tips on how to achieve these goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading.
Is it worthwhile to do floor core exercises for climbing performance? I’ve heard a lot of mix things about core exercises- some say those 10 minute core exercises are beneficial for a strong core while others find it stupid. 

To me, these exercises feel hard but they’re more like a core endurance kind of workout which I don’t know to be beneficial for climbing or not. And I wonder if I get enough of a core workout just climbing on more overhung terrain? I also do quite a bit of bar core so I don’t know if it really makes a difference to add floor core to the mix. 

I just am not convinced at all that these are worth doing. I guess keeping your core engaged for many minutes is difficult- but is beneficial for climbing is my question?
History of Climbing: Data About First Ascentionists Over Time (Female and Male) I am always interested in the history of rock climbing. Lately I  tried to collect data about male and female first ascentionists for my rock climbing and statistics [blog Climbstat](http://climbstat.blogspot.com) to  visualize progression over time. However, it turned out difficult to  find a lot of data (particularly for female climbers). An exception to  the rule is this really nice site [http://stara.emontana.cz/climbing-milestones-from-6a-to-9c/](http://stara.emontana.cz/climbing-milestones-from-6a-to-9c/)  from which I got a lot of information.

It  would be great if someone could point me to further sources!   
I find it particularly difficult to get information  about, among others,  


* first onsights and flashes (who was the first to onsight 8a or flash 8b+?) 
* first successful female and male bouldering ascents
* early first female ascents (does anyone know who did the first female 7a?)
* 'first' second ascents (who did the second 8c in the world?)

Here what I have found / done so far ([data can be accessed via the blog post](http://climbstat.blogspot.com/2020/01/first-ascentionists-over-time-male.html)):

I have a hard time trusting any belayer I was dropped when being lowered about 8 months ago, ended up breaking my foot. It was my belayer literally being an idiot. Dropped me with a gri gri plus of all things, I honestly don't understand how. 

It's been 8 months and I still am not comfortable with any partner regardless of their experience. I climb most often with my bf who is inexperienced comparatively. And I honestly come off the wall 4 clips up and come down (on TR, he doesn't have his lead cert yet) because I'm too scared to go to the top and then end up being dropped from the top when lowered. 

And just today he dropped his friend (about 100 lbs heavier than him) from the 2nd clip when lowering him, it was more understandable as to why, but still is avoidable. But this didn't help my fear. It sucks cause I love sport but I'm so nervous now and if I'm lowered even a little fast, I'm freaking out. Or if there's a slight drop as I am lowered I will freak out. 

Anyone else have something similar, and how long/ how did you get past it?


Edit: my bf is not the one who dropped me. He hasn't dropped me. But did drop his friend.
Can a powerball help me with climber's elbow? What's your story? What the title says. Dealing with both flaring on the inside and outside of the connection tendons on my elbows and trying to figure out ways to get them stronger.

Basically, if I boulder hard for more than two sessions a week, I will most likely need to recover for 5+ days because my elbow dies.

Has anyone used powerballs for rehab and strengthening the motions we need for climbing? What would you recommend?
To all those upset about Hoseok's opinion on his genetics and not convinced, you should read this comment "To those who feel triggered about the genetics part in the video:
first of all, sorry if I hurt you in some ways, did not intend it so.
and second, I just can’t lay out every little details of what I did in the gym... It’s literally impossible. but I believe you can climb everyday, especially when you’re a beginner, if being smart(adjusting intensity of each session etc.)
and I was a student back then when I first started climbing and did literally nothing but climbing, I even skipped school to recover from climbing, and stayed in bed all day long before the gym just to feel fit lol
yeah stupid cuz got some F grades on some of the subjects I took, but that’s how passionate I was in climbing. They say it’s a miracle that I could graduate lol 
I also said, “yeah genetics play a certain role too, like I don’t play basketball cuz I’m too short for the sport” I never said I’m not gifted as a climber, I’m saying, HARD WORK &gt; genetics
btw, I had to go through sooooo many injuries in those five years of climbing... even now I’m suffering from this finger tendon injury... Idk why everyone just thinks that I was injury-free.
Starting age is obviously a pretty crucial factor too, I can agree, though I don’t see it affecting it that much to get to like v9/10 level, which is already an advanced level as a climber.
Hope you all can achieve what you wish to achieve in climbing! Also stay injury-free"



First of all, he addresses the misconception that he has been injury free. This is the most surprising part to me as it is incredible that he kept climbing at such a high level. 

Second, he literally would skip school all day to recover for climbing, and failed classes for it. That is some dedication, and with how incredibly important recovery is to climbing, that is one of the biggest takeaways for me. He was able to focus his mindset, energy, and time directly into climbing and recovering almost everyday of the week. I think brushing off all this and saying "he doesn't understand how genes work" is really disrespectful. I think if I did this and had that level of mindset (which feels a lot more stressful and less fun to most climbers), I would probably improve a lot more than I am.
What is your climbing anti-style? What do you need to do to improve at that style? I think it could be interesting to hear what people are doing to combat their climbing weaknesses. Maybe we could get some people who exceed at another's anti-style to give some tips as well.
Finger popped on a small pocket Crap.
Heard a snap yesterday on a boulder where the right hand is on a bad sloper, left hand on a 2-finger pocket, no foot holds (smear on wall). I was smart enough to end the session right there, but still have a nasty pain below my ring finger/ pinky right now.
Made a doc’s appointment so I’ll keep you guys posted, but I guess it’s prob A2 pulley?
Any advice on how to recover the next weeks? Got a bouldering trip to Font coming up in about 3months, so I hope I’ll be good to again by then.

EDIT1:
Went to the doc, who thought I broke something. Went to the x-ray people, who told me there wasn’t any fracture. I’ll have to call the doc again in a bit when they get the X-ray picture to hear what’s what :)
What's the single best core exercise? I have a pre-climbing warmup I'm happy with; now I want to develop a short routine that I can do after every gym climbing/training session. 
It will include some pushing &amp; antagonist exercises, a little stretching, and a short core workout. This is obviously not a full training regimen; I want the whole routine to take 15 minutes or so ...  So, if you could only do one core exercise, for 3-5 minutes, what would it be?
Why am i having too much trouble on slopers? I have trouble moving my feet higher when i am golding slopers even if i can hold the sloper for days, it feels like the rock will threw me off if i dare to move my feet higher. 

Do you guys have any advice on this?
In case anyone is following this series on Wrist Stability Training and Recovery, here's the Advanced Wrist Exercise program :)
What's your training plan? Title says it all. I'd love to hear about your training plan... however much you're willing to share. I'll take anything: it could be as broad as a one-liner training philosophy or as detailed as a full plan with time under tension and rest time outlined. No discrimination here.

I'm posting this out of selfish motivations ( I want to be able to have this archived, so I can come back here to take anything I find useful and integrate it into my own training), but I think that it could be beneficial to the greater community as well if there's enough responses.
Hoseok Lee training routine Okay so until now I’ve only been climbing for fun, but now I’m thinking I should probably start training specifically for climbing (bouldering) and I just watched the video on hoseok Lee’a training routine that got him to a v8 in about one year (I think). I was thinking of using that routine for my training aswell, or at least something very similar to it, however I am just wondering if that kind of training would be good for everyone, especially people that just got into climbing recently?
What would an ideal max effort day look like in a power cycle? (v8 climber) Hello and thanks for any and all info

Power is my biggest weakness and I am finally devoting effort to catch it up. I am really lost when it comes to power training. Most of my knowledge is based on either endurance training as an ex cross country runner, or strengthening as an ex powerlifter. I know there isn't 100% carry  over, but I am just generally lost when it comes to power training.

My idea for the cycle is to have 4 climbing days, 1 full body gym day (with power exercises), and also do plyometrics in the morning before my easiest climbing day of the week.
Training Glossary So we (Lattice Training) are putting together a glossary of terms related to climbing training that we hope the training community at large can use as a bit of a reference and as a starting point for further research.

I was wondering if you knowledgeable folk had any suggestions for terminology that should be on there?

This is what we've got so far:  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bt\_AXWzcMO7BBtxrlNuu\_8yhBKnQOr0BrppvzU3--ss/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bt_AXWzcMO7BBtxrlNuu_8yhBKnQOr0BrppvzU3--ss/edit?usp=sharing) You can add stuff directly to it or just add comments here and I'll collect em all up.

There's a few things on there that are pretty climbing focused, but we want it to have more of a climbing + training focus.

ed: messed up the permissions on the doc, should be fixed now.
How to know finger strength is holding us back? In the climbing community better climbers are talking to newbie climbers to focus on technique first and then on finger strength. As this is 100% right i have focused on improving technique in the past year and made a lot of gains there but here comes the question. How to know when finger strength is holding us back?
How a boulderer can become a sport climber **A Boulderer’s Sport Climbing Season Performance Review:**

I’ve seen this kind of question come up before, so I figured I’d share my experience to hopefully help out any other boulderers looking to get better at sport climbing. Plus, I enjoy reviewing my past climbing and training, so figured I’d take a look at my past sport climbing season, and give myself a performance review on how I did. I’m predominantly a boulderer, and began 2019 with the assumption that I’d focus most of my efforts on bouldering throughout the year, including over the long South Eastern summer. About halfway through the year, I decided that I was tired of feeling like I sucked at sport climbing, so decided to tackle it head on, and see how good I could get.

**What I did:**

I put together a bit more lack-luster of a send list than I’d have hoped for, but I was able to put down 2 5.12c’s (Both of which were quite hard for me stylistically), 3 5.12b’s, 5 5.12a’s, and 15+ 5.11’s. I also spent a lot more time on 5.13’s than I ever have, and I was able to get some solid links on several 5.13a projects, including falling off the very last move of one, and punting another after sticking the crux jump. Overall, I was able to complete 45 new routes, which is far fewer than I hoped for initially. This is compared to the previous year where I made climbing 5.12’s a priority from the beginning, and I was able to send a full 5.12 pyramid up to 5.12d, and sent 85 total routes.

**How I trained:**
As a boulderer, I actually had a pretty good single effort fitness base level. However, I was/am REALLY bad at recovering, so my main tactic on routes was to just sprint to the top, and most of my training was focused on recovering in shorter periods of time. I found the 1 on 1 off workout from the Crimpd app to target that recovery system really well. I combined that with some standard low intensity Varied ARC-ing, primarily the 8x3 workout from Crimpd. These workouts helped me a ton, and I saw some significant improvements on my routes. Between those two, for the first time, I was able to get to a jug, shake out, and recover enough to feel fresh enough to try hard between boulder problems. This was not something I’d ever been able to do before, so it made a massive difference in how I viewed and selected routes.

In sport season, my week would look something like:

Monday: Strength and power focus. Bouldering in the gym and/or Moonboard. Supplemental lifts.

Tuesday: Endurance and recovery focus. Warm up on boulders, then do circuits on a spray wall, and ideally an ARC session after

Wednesday: Rest

Thursday: Strength and Power focus. Bouldering on new gym set, maybe some moonboard. Supplemental lifts. Maybe another ARC session.

Friday: Rest

Saturday: Outdoor day, Projecting and sending focus. 

Sunday: Rest


**Things I did well:**

- I pushed myself out of my comfort zone, both in styles and on grades.

- I found what makes me enjoy sport climbing

- I discovered a root cause for many weaknesses, and began a rehab and strengthening program that I stuck with religiously

- I realized just how significantly training can impact performance on the wall. I’d never been convinced that I would actually be able to have good endurance, but I showed myself that I was capable of it.

**Things that I could have done better.**

- I didn’t do a good job at adhering to my planned endurance workouts for the first half of my season. By the time I realized how important working that was, half the season was gone.

- The volume of sends was quite low. Too many weekends had no sends, resulting in a rather small base of sport climbs.

- Switching focus from bouldering to sport half-way through the year threw off some of my goals. Having to train for a bouldering performance trip just when I should have been entering endurance mode was distracting.


**Biggest lessons learned:**

- Endurance training works, and even a devout boulderer can gain a good bit of endurance if they want.

- Keep the goal the goal. Don’t get distracted from pushing for them, even when it’s easier to say you’ll do it later. Setting the right goals helps make this easier.

- Getting on hard stuff is the first step to sending hard stuff. It provided me with a better understanding of what was actually holding me back from sending them.

- Volume and base of experience is still very important for me. I need to build that base so I can feel confident and comfortable on that “easier” terrain for harder sends

- Conditions matter, but I probably can switch back into bouldering season sooner if I capitalize on the right weather windows during the “sending season”


I’m looking forward to getting to apply these lessons to my upcoming sport climbing season, so would be interested in any comments or tips from others who have gone through this process before!
Synovitis and Oral Steroids, another experience - with pictures Some background: A few years ago (2-2.5) I ruptured the collateral ligament on my left hand pointer finger while climbing. I didn't have any scans done, but it was diagnosed by a medical professional. I didn't have to stop climbing, but had to limit the kinds of holds I used and intensity. Eventually, my finger healed, but remained inflamed. My middle finger also started to swell, most likely due to overcompensation. For a long time I ignored the symptoms. It didn't really hurt, but my range of motion was pretty limited. 

Around 6-9 months post injury I was able to climb like normal, but still had some decent swelling. I went to have my finger looked at. After having an ultrasound, it seemed that the swelling was a mixture of scar tissue and fluid buildup. I followed the typical protocols for synovitis at the time. I cut back on hard climbing, tried ROM exercises, rice bucket and some finger rolls. None of these did much. At most stiffness the day after climbing was alleviated slightly, but not much more.

After reading u/thelatemercutio [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/cms5nc/my_personal_case_study_using_oral_steroids_to/) on using oral steroids to help treat synovitis I was intrigued. I decided to pursue the same short-term tapered dose treatment after a climbing trip I had at the end of 2019. Once I got back in town, I met my PCP who was pretty hesitant to prescribe 4-methylprednisolone for my issue stating it wasn't a typical use for the drug. Instead he referred me to an orthopedic hand specialist who took an xray and then prescribed the steroids. 

The specialist did note that there was swelling in a couple of my PIP joints and wasn't sure if the methylprednisolone would work, but was willing to give it a shot agreeing with the diagnosis of synovitis. They also pointed out that there was a small likelihood that my collateral ligament damage had left a bone shard in my finger which accounted for some of the swelling and said an MRI was necessary to find out for sure. The specialist also recommended sleeping in compression gloves and agreed that I should continue my ROM exercises as well as low weight high rep finger rolls.

I started taking the steroids on 12/21 and took a break from climbing, sleeping in compression gloves nightly and doing 4 sets of 25 rep finger rolls with a comfortable weight everyday. I still sleep in the gloves and do the finger rolls every day I am not climbing. ROM exercises have become intermittent but happen near daily when I'm bored or watching TV.

I had a follow up with the specialist and she was surprised by the improvement and suggested that since I had no pain or discomfort seeking an MRI wasn't necessary. The lack of discomfort indicated that surgery wasn't necessary. This is likely my new normal.

[Some pictures for reference](https://imgur.com/a/C4wWhSM) - I took a picture many more days, but think this is representative. If anyone wants to see other days please let me know, the farther out I got the less pictures I took. I took pictures at approximately the same time each morning, prior to taking the prednisolone if I was still taking it. I also included some pictures of my right hand so you can see that I also just have fat knuckles.

The prednisolone took effect in just a few days and seems to have lasting effects with upkeep. I'm very happy with the results despite not having resounding success. Obviously, my fingers aren't perfect, but they are better than they were and tend towards being less stiff after hard climbing. I've been climbing and training hard (maybe harder than ever) since the start of the new year and haven't had to think twice about grabbing a tiny hold or hang boarding with a large amount of weight.

Schöffl / Matros / Dicki Korb: Adjunct Compensatory Training for Rock Climbing Hei,
If you haven'T read it on instagram or elsewhere:
Patrik Matros and Dicki Korb (Trainers of Megos) teamed up with Prof. Volker Schöffel (One Move too Many)  and wrote a book about general and injury specific compensation training. What they mean by that: "The goal of our ACT-Training is to compensate biased movement patterns and strengthen the structures of the locomotive system which undergo high strain during climbing." While most folks would call that antagonist training, they have a more holistic approach.

The book has a general and a injuri specific section as well as fancy photos. You can see it here: **[www.act.clinic](http://www.act.clinic)**.

While i knew most of the excercises it's very nice to have them ordered by injury and explicitly curated by their usefulness for climbers.
So tired... The last year I have been working my ass off. Not just at work, (where things have picked up quite a bit ) but also at home where I have renovated my house, had to rush the last part in december and am now helping out my daughter with her new house. In between I had my best year rock climbing ever with my first 7a, 6a+ multipitch high in the French alps, 6b multipitch in Greece, etc. But now I am so tired. Don't seem to be resting very much anymore, even when I do nothing for a day.

I am all antsy to start training again, reading up climbharder and all that, watching youtubes about training and climbing etc. But I feel in my body like I need a bit of a break.

How would you do that? Keep climbing, just at a much lower intensity? Less frequent? Climbing still is major fun for me.

BTW, I am 54, hope this doesn't mean the end of my active life yet...
In the Crimpd app, what is workload based on? Is it a score out of 100? I’m trying to find it’s relevance or how I can use it. Maybe to plan rests?
Unsolicited Review of Anderson Bros Rock Climber's Training Manual **tl;dr:**  I went from drowning in all of the training spray on the internet, to understanding the core aspects of training for climbing, and being able to read/digest/evaluate online advice and build my own training program. I improved about 1.5+ bouldering grades in 4 months.

&amp;#x200B;

about me: I picked up the Anderson book in September. Climbing age about 4 years, but only 1 year climbing after a multi-year break due to injury. TA essentially zero. I am 27.  Before reading Anderson Bros, I was comfortable at the V4 level in my gym. Mostly indoor bouldering due to location. Climb 2-3 times per week.

&amp;#x200B;

***REVIEW:***

&amp;#x200B;

The number one benefit to me of reading the Anderson Brothers book, is that it gave me the knowledge to build my own training plan. I feel I was at exactly the right experience level to learn from the book. Before reading their book I felt knowledgeable about broad training ideas such as rep ranges, progressive overload, muscle groups and nutrition, but was having so much trouble digesting all of the training beta spray that is available online. (e.g.: Mesocycles vs. microcycles. Linear vs. nonlinear. Max hangs vs. repeaters. How to pick and choose from the million drills out there. etc...)

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to comment on some specific aspects of the book:

&amp;#x200B;

**Linear Training:**

Independent of whether a 'performance peak' is desirable or not, I found a number of aspects of linear training very appealing:

\- Hangboard phase: Having a dedicated hangboard phase was amazing for my body. Climbing hard puts your joints in a lot of awkward and compromising positions. While I was in the hangboard phase all of my finger, wrist, and shoulder tweaks healed, and I was also still able to make large gains in finger strength. With weights you can dial in a very specific intensity of training on your fingers, and load them in an ergonomic way. 

\- Learning: The linear program is helpful pedagogically. For someone new, it separates out the different concepts of training into phases, so you can learn, one at a time, what each type of training is useful for. You can clearly feel how your body changes when focusing on a specific type of training.

\- Identifying weakness: When focusing on one type of training at a time, I found it much easier to identify where my weaknesses were.

\- Focus: I personally feast when I can get hyperfocused on one thing. In this way linear training was great for me because I could fully invest myself in a type of training for a few weeks, and see improvement.

&amp;#x200B;

**Climbing mileage:** 

I have read complaints that the Anderson program is too tedious and there is not enough on-the-wall time. Personally I thought they placed a very strong emphasis on getting in mileage and building skills. I also got the sense that the Anderson bros believe most people do not ARC correctly. They have described ARCing should be pretty pumpy, and also should have a strong focus on building movement skills. As a boulderer I limited the ARC phase to only a few sessions, but I still felt large benefits from doing a little bit of ARCing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Campus training:**

Anderson bros suggest everyone should do campus training even a 'beginner' who would climb at the low 5.12 level. This is where I deviated strongly from them as I felt my fingers were not resilient enough to campus. I tried some work on the campus rungs with my feet on in order to gain some familiarity with the rungs, but found \`limit' bouldering to be a better use of my time at my current ability level. However I put 'limit' in quotes because I haven't figured out yet how to work limit moves correctly. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

If you're trying to get into training I definitely recommend their book as a starting point. Anyone who geeks out about training will enjoy it.  Some people say the book is 'out of date'. I am not an expert and best-practices seem to evolve rather quickly, but I think book still provides a great amount of evidence-based information on training. It has a strong theoretical base that helps me think about training.

 **Would I have improved this much under a different training program?** **YES.** However I am unsure if under a different program if I would have learned as much about training philosophy and designing a program.

**Would I have improved this much if I had 'just climbed'?** I don't think so. I felt a noticeable acceleration in my progress after starting training. I estimate I improved about 1.5 grades over 4 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading \*my\* training spray.
Any ice climbers here to critique my technique? Near the top rope anchor of a single pitch WI4. Practicing putting in screws and finding good rest stances.
Alternative hip hinge exercises In my gym I do not have access to a bar with weights for deadlifts or a kettlebell. We do have some dumbells, rings and a pullup bar. Are there any good alternatives to these exercises? What do you do to train your posterior chain?
Strength prerequisites for one-arm hangs and a digression on fingerboard progressions Unilateral (one-arm) vs. bilateral (two-arm) hangs came up recently in an Instagram story by Natasha Barnes. Natasha suggested that there was no point to doing one-arm hangs because the added anti-rotational strength component (in the shoulder) reduced load on the finger flexors and thus the effectiveness of the exercise. I think that objection has merit but is worth exploring more deeply.

To preface this, I respect Natasha's expertise and experience. Because the internet can so quickly degrade into name-calling and nastiness, especially towards women, I want to emphasize that she *actually works with climbers*; most of the people on this sub not only don't train others but don't, really, train themselves. (Sorry to be blunt, but it's true, and it's a major limitation of this platform in particular.)

My experience, that of the posters here who've worked with Lattice, and I think that of Lattice themselves \[citation needed: u/remuslattice?\] is that the sum of individual one-arm scores almost always exceeds that of two-arm scores, usually by a wide margin (10% or more). To me that implies that one-arm hangs are actually *better* for isolating finger strength, at least on the fairly large edges used for testing (\~18–20mm). If using any sort of assistance placed to the side and gripped with the non-hanging arm (pulley, band, cord), then the rotational component is mostly eliminated. Even very strong climbers who are adding weight to their one-arms can take advantage of this by adding (say) an additional 10lbs to their harness but also 10lbs to the pulley, simply to counteract rotation.

All that aside, the ability to resist rotation via the shoulder is a critical climbing movement. Even if you neglect or minimize training it on the fingerboard, you should train it on the wall, on a bar, and/or on the rings.

In other posts and comments, especially in chat, I've argued that one-arm hangs offer a few benefits over two-arm hangs, especially for stronger climbers. Despite what I said above about pulleys, the fact is one-arms *do* engage the shoulder differently than two-arm hangs, and in a way which I find much more specific to climbing. Hanging from one arm is probably the single most common position in climbing—included in almost every single movement—so I think it should obviously be trained in some capacity.

Does that mean *everyone* should train this? No! (And probably "hell no" from remote coaches, who can't safely recommend this to clients they can't directly coach and cue!) As I see it, there are three primary reasons to prefer bilateral hangs:

1. Your fingers are not strong enough on the given hold, forcing you to remove excessive amounts of weight to hang with one arm. My best guess is that if your maximum 5-second one-arm hang is less than 75% bodyweight per arm, you are better off with bilateral hangs. This is trivially true for almost everyone grabbing very small edges (≤10mm).
2. Your shoulders are too immobile to hang correctly with one arm. Immobility is a serious issue among climbers; among the half-dozen good climbers I've tested, most could not safely and correctly demonstrate basic overhead mobility on a bar. If you can't get into the proper, safe position, you can't do one arms.
3. Your shoulders are too weak to hang correctly. This is related to mobility but also somewhat separate. Due to my personal injury history (I was a thrower in a past life) I err towards being "too strong" overhead, and can easily hold at least 80lbs (44%BW) more on a bar than an edge. That's probably excessive, but if your gap is closer to 20%BW I would hesitate to recommend one-arm hangs. Somewhere between the two sounds more reasonable.

People are always ripping climbharder for overwhelming them with information, so what's the takeaway? For me it's this:

* Build up to the prerequisite strength and mobility metrics first. My rough guidelines would be a minimum one-arm edge hang of \~75%BW and a one-arm bar hold of 115%BW.
* Don't neglect mobility. If in doubt, go see someone who knows what they're doing and can set you straight. This will save you from injuries, but it will also improve the transfer of your training: being consistently out of position in training means you'll get strong but in irrelevant movements.
* As you build strength and experience, prefer to transition towards harder bodyweight variations of fingerboarding than to continue adding more weight. The transfer is pretty minimal beyond about 140%BW bilateral hangs, and if you're in that realm you're better off switching the stimulus by using one arm, worse holds, or fewer fingers (and more grips).

The progression you choose will depend on your goals. Climbing limestone pockets? Use fewer fingers. Doing powerful boulders? Prefer the one-arms. Crimping granite? Use smaller holds. You become what you do, so choose wisely. If you're unsure of your goals, as all of us are as beginners (and really, up to around V10/11), then try out each strategy for 6–8 weeks at a time, take good notes, and learn from the experience.

The flipside of "just climbing" is to "vary your training", which exposes you to different movements (climbing) or methods (training). The more knowledge and experience you have, the more you can adjust your training to your needs and the better your transfer.

**Questions for climbers/coaches:**

1. Generally, what do you think? Am I off-base here, and really the best course of action is simply to (say) pound away at two-arm hangs?
2. What are your guidelines for recommending/prescribing different finger exercise progressions? (Fewer fingers, one-arms, small edges, etc.)
3. Are there particular mobility tests that you use for one-arm hangs? (I really like Udo Neumann's "monkey hangs" on the bar.)

**Edit:** Neil Gresham made an Instagram post partly about this, suggesting one arms as part of the package for advancing beyond V9: https://www.instagram.com/p/B8qd2gcDZLr/?igshid=2htacavh6esh
How long into climbing were you when you started moon-boarding? I've started moonboardng in order to build more strength and improve my climbing ability, but feel that many of the climbs are still pretty difficult. 

I'm projecting some of the easiest V4s on there. Have been climbing for close to one year.
Data splurge from 2016-now + my training stuff At the start of 2016 I decided that climbing would probably be the only sport for me, typical new year new me style. After several months I got serious with the idea thanks to meeting a crazy strong climber that made me want to try harder. [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lnlp2MyTKUH9HP7OxWpUDDLB_MCb8C5FVVDnYr-ghxQ/edit?usp=sharing) is a trimmed down version of my training spreadsheet (still pretty big and hard to read but functional).

[This](https://imgur.com/wTrDM8q) is the tldr of the spreadsheet. The blue plot is that of climbing grade and the red is training hours per day (the line is a running average of 7 points). Immediately it's pretty clear that I have got harder on myself with regards to grades! I went from maybe a mid 6 (font) climber in 2016 to an outdoor 7A climber in 2017 and at the time I thought nothing would stop the progression.

A few notable minor injuries bring down my grades, but generally I'd say there's less progression because I don't let myself get away with soft self grading anymore. Each bit of gradient is hard fought for and it's only averaging V8/7B now because I can actually climb the odd moonboard 7B-C on a good day, my first outdoor 7C the other weekend, etc.

Speaking of the moonboard… [Here](https://imgur.com/RizcAUu) is my current total logbook. Should say that this is made up of the 2016 40 degree set a bit, 2017 40 degree board the most and the 2017 25 degree board more recently. I've been training on the moonboard a fair bit over the last few months, taking a lot of inspiration from the one and only Hoseok Lee. 

A few training benchmarks atm (bodyweight ~ 64.5-65kg):

* +56.25 kg 7 second 2 arm max hang on the 18mm beastmaker 1k crimps (half crimp)
* +2.5kg 5 second hang 1 arm on the beastmaker 2k 22mm edge left arm - bodyweight on the right. (90 degree lockoff)
* ~45 kg kg 2 rep max pullups - not tested properly in a few months so optimistically 47.5 kg?
* ~27.5 kg 5x5 pullups
* A very lucky full left arm one arm pullup (strict) on the best day, right arm is still a bit off
* Pretty clean prone T's
* ~5-7 seconds full good form front lever

My current training revolves around a 2 days on and 1 day off rule. The second day on is a serious tryhard day and the first is a fuckaround climbing day. One of my favourite things at the moment is slightly weighted moonboarding, adding a ~5kg weight vest and smashing up problems I've done several times. The other day I had a rampage through the grades and discovered that a soft 7A+ benchmark with the vest is a serious endeavour, so I may make that a short term goal. After my fingers had peaked I then lowered the grade and blasted through 6A+-C benchmarks until my arms were struggling.

More typical training sessions consist of 5x5 pullups, offset on the minute pullups, max hangs, moonboard projecting, front levers and floor core. Standard shit, though I sometimes experiment with things like Hoseoks pullup routine and such.

It seems like with every passing year I'm getting better at training harder. Perhaps I'm nearly due a bit of a jump in grade! Either that or it's time to downgrade myself to V7/8 again so I can progress up to V9 ;)
Watch out for this one y'all! From a real PT: Google's #1 Recommendation for Finger Pain is the WORST ADVICE I've ever seen
How much progress have you made in the last year? What do you attribute your progress to? I'm curious to get a sense of feel on how fast the average poster here is progressing, and also what have you guys done that was particularly helpful in achieving that progress.
What is currently holding you back from your climbing or training goals? What is currently holding you back from your climbing or training goals? What are you (or are you even) going to do about it?
What do you do the 1-2 days before trying a hard boulder or route? I usually try to skip the gym and not climb for at least two days before trying a project. I’m ok doing yoga or stretching those days. What should I be doing with my fingers? I usually pull onto the hangboard for just a couple minutes, but I don’t do anything at limit or anything that will get me pumped. I just do it because I feel like not doing anything might be worse and I want to keep the muscles, tendons, joints at least a little active.
Training insight based on heart rate. Anyone use HR to help training? I'm looking for suggestions and advice. More about the session in comments.
How exactly to progress when doing max hangs? In the past i did some hangboarding and always hurt my fingers in some way. After 2-3 weeks of hangboarding something always started to hurt and that's why i gave it up. Now i know what was the problem, every workout i tried to hang as much weight as i can and a lot of the times even not finishing all of the hangs. I was a fool.

Now i want to know how exactly to progress. I was thinking about doing a test session every four weeks to see what i can hang for 10 sec and then hang for 7 sec with the exact same weight but it seems to be too slow. I know strength gains on the hangboard should be slow and controlled but still want to make the most of it. What do you guys think? How do you progress with the weight on the hangboard?
Such wisdom in so few words... **"If you want better endurance, do more repetitions or longer problems per set.**

**If you want more power-endurance, rest less between sets.**

**If you need more power, perform exercises more quickly or climb faster.**

**If you want to get stronger, add load or difficulty to your next session.**

**If you need more capacity, do more sets or more exercises (or even more training days) next time."**

\- His Holiness, Steve Bechtel
When will it be beneficial to have a training plan, instead of climbing thoughtfully every session? At low levels I figure it’s more efficient to just climb, but at what point (grade) would it be best and most efficient (to increase grade) to switch to a more sophisticated training program?
Core benchmarks for climbing hard An ideal conclusion would look like this: Most 7c/8a/8b  climbers can do X exercise, for this amount of time or reps.

I'm curious if you could think of any useful benchmarks for core. I know this will be next to impossible, as climbing is so complex, yet I'm curious about the discussion of it.

Examples might be, Front Lever with only one extended leg for x amount of seconds,, L-sit for x amount of seconds etc..
Hangboarding Skin Pinch My repeaters on the hangboard are being limited by the skin pain in the crease of my finger. If there is a visible pulling of the skin, I've tried to sand them. Though it hasn't helped much. Tips to deal with this?
Cardio for Recovery Regular climber here.

Climbed pretty hard at the gym yesterday, did a core workout, and then decided to go on a jog after that on a whim. I worked up a sweat on the jog, but I intentionally didn't push myself too hard. Woke up this morning, and I'm way less sore than I thought I would be. Was it the run that helped? Or, was it more related to me eating an entire pizza afterwards and sleeping a little extra?
Is there a trick to keeping your feet on the rock? I am your average gym climber. I can usually climb V5-V6 indoors and generally rely on my upperbody strength to pull through the problems. Climbing indoors makes sense to me; I see the colorful plastic footchip, and I press down on it with my toes to engage the tension. 

However, every time I go outside, my feet immediately slip down. I really do not understand how to trust my feet on rock, especially granite. It feels like my lower body does nothing for me. I put a lot of mental energy into using my lower body, but I don't think that energy is being applied properly. I want to improve but don't have many good references in person to ask about outdoor climbing technique.

Thanks
Strength Training Routine Critique I'm getting back into climbing, likely mostly bouldering, after a solid 8-10 years since when I used to climb regularly. I'm piecing together a workout routine to help improve my strength and would like some input. 

First, I know that the best thing to do is climb. Unfortunately, I'm a shift-working paramedic with a couple of injuries to work around. This means I can't climb as much as I would like, and I need to rehab/maintain my current issues without aggravating them on the wall. I also need to be functionally fit to do my job.

Prior to this, I've been doing standard strength training. I quickly discovered that my squatting and deadlifting has given me heavy and less mobile legs than would be ideal.

The goal would be to lift 2-3x a week, and to climb 2-3x a week as well. I've got an old injured supraspinatus and bicep tendon as well as a bum knee (thankfully no tears, just years of bad biomechanics). I'm planning to focus on lean strength in a minimalist routine that won't wear me out for climbing.

The routine is as follows:

- Warmup with Hip Halo and Crossover Symmetry (side note, these two things are lifesavers for shoulder and knee issues)

- Simple and Sinister Kettlebell routine (10x10 KB swings and 10 TGUs)

- Pull-up routine until able to do 3x10, then weighted pull-ups (this has always been my weakest area)

- Core finisher

Obviously it won't hit everything, but it should give me good power and core strength on the wall as well as some pushing/stabilizing with the shoulders.

What do you think? I'm wondering if I should add more pressing (i.e. weighted push-ups) for shoulder stability or if the heavy TGUs will be enough to avoid any pulling overuse injuries.
AMA #2, Neuroscience of Training Hey guys, I made a thread like this a couple of weeks ago, today I have some free time so shoot me any questions you would like to have answered about the neuroscience behind movement or training in general. I try to answer always with scientific proof or trends in either way in my head.

I can't figure out how to eat [bit of a rant] Hello!

I've been climbing for maybe ten years, though never climbed harder than 12a/V7 in the gym, and 11b/V4 outside. My number one problem is my weight. I'm 5'11" and 215 lbs.

I know how to lose weight and I've done it before, but always through weight training and caloric restriction. Every time I try to lose weight while continuing to climb, it's miserable. My climbing suffers, my training suffer, I get super unmotivated, get injured, and basically give up. I've found out that climbing really sucks when you're in a caloric deficit, at least for me. 

I'm just being a bitch about it, I know. I'm not looking for a pick me up - I'm simply posting here hoping maybe someone else deals with this and might offer some advice

Thanks reddit :)
Training Plan to Climb 5.12/7a+ Hi everybody,

I'm 25 years old and I have been climbing for almost a year now (mostly sport climbing) and can comfortably onsight 6b+/5.10d (I have redpointed until 6c+/5.11b). I am now working on routes of the grade 7a/5.11c. I know I haven't climbed for a long time (though I did lots of sports in the past and have been always pretty fit) and that my level is not bad for the time I have been climbing, but I would like to take it to the next level and follow an actual training to become better in the most efficient way possible (and not getting injured). Also, I haven't reached a plateau yet so just by climbing like I am already doing, I would climber harder, so I am just really just looking how to train better. 

So far, my routine has been 2/3 times a week climbing at my indoor climbing gym with sessions of about 4 hours, climbing with friends with no particular goal and mostly for fun: warming up on easy routes and then working on harder routes (6c to 7a/ 5.11a to 5.11 c). I have also climbed outside as much as possible but it is not always easy in my rainy country (Belgium). Since January this year, I have also added an extra session at the gym to work on antagonist muscles to prevent any injuries, so lots of push-ups, forearm exercises, as well as some pull-ups. I was inspired by the routine done by Hoseok (a Korean climber on youtube): [https://youtu.be/IHHEKcfVIsg](https://youtu.be/IHHEKcfVIsg)

I am planning a climbing trip to France in about 3 months so I thought that it would be perfect to have a 3-months training leading to my trip, and I am now looking to which options are the bests. So far, I have found the following options:

&amp;#x200B;

* **The Power Company (** [https://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/](https://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/) )

They offer different options like personal training, app-based training or ebook training. They look pretty legit with climbing podcasts and great reviews. Their app-based "proven plans" cost 75$ without coach support (175 with) and their ebook costs 20$ (sounds like a great deal?!). Plus, the program I would take "CLIMB 5.12" takes 12 weeks, so it would be perfect for the length of it. The app-based "proven plan" and the ebooks seem pretty similar, only that the app-based training look easier to use as it is an app? But it is 55$ more so not sure it is worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Training Beta (** [https://www.trainingbeta.com/](https://www.trainingbeta.com/) )

They offer different training programs and the one I would take is "Route Climbing Training Program". It takes 6 weeks to complete and costs 14.99$/month with 2 weeks trial. 6 weeks is half the time of the Power Company training plan so I am not sure it could get me as far. I could complete 2 programs though, and that would be 12 weeks in total, and a total price of 45$.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Lattice Training (** [https://latticetraining.com/](https://latticetraining.com/) )

Finally, the one I have been hearing a lot about, especially since they have worked with Magnus Mitbo, EpicTV/Climbing daily on youtube, ... They seem very legit as they are mostly data-evidence based and have analyzed lots of climbers. They offer different plans but the one I was looking at is the Lite plan. The Lite plan costs 100 pounds (+/- 130$) and lasts 12 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

So far those are the options I have found online. They differ a lot on the price, but I guess you get what you pay for? I could get the ebook training from Power Company at 20$ but how would that compare to a Lattice plan at 130$ that seems more tailored for me? But then again, it would be my first time having a climbing training plan so I could start with a 20$ plan. Has anyone trained with any of those plans? Or any other plans? What are your recommendations? And if you have any other tips, I would love to hear them!

Thanks a lot for your help!
Free technical analysis [FOLLOWUP] I just finished the first analysis and as some of you asked here it is.

First of all I have to say that unfortunately unlike other sports climbing doesn’t have as much research on what is correct technique. This means that what I am posting here is my understanding of the existing literature and my climbing/coaching experience. Some points will be obvious and others will generate discussion. This discussion is important to improve our understanding of technique and for me to improve my assignment (;
It was impossible for me not to think of training recommendations while doing this. Let me know if anyone is interested in that. 

I have not included any sources here if you are interested PM me.

Importante notes: this climb is graded V8/9 and it was a redpoint. The paper that is the base for this analysis is "Establishing a global scale for assessing lead climbing performance" by Taylor, N. Giles, D. &amp; Mitchell, J.

Technical analysis:

· Hand placement: all hand placements were precise on the first time with very small readjustments (persistent during the attempt) of every hold (even the ones on the top out) before using them to create movement even though the position and gripping technique does not change. 

· Feet placement: the same thing applies to the feet. Every time a foot is placed it is in the right position but there is always a small, unnecessary, readjustment. 

· The center of mass is always in opposition of the holds used and the swings are stopped first time, which indicates a good use of dynamic balance.

· The movements are relatively smooth with exception for the “jerk” created by the constant readjustments.

· There are no exploratory moves. The gaze is directed momentarily in the direction of the next hold (visual exploration) and this does not interfere with the fluidity of the sequence.

· I will not evaluate the sequence because of its subjective nature and because the evaluation is done with no contact with the boulder. This way I avoid having to make assumptions and keep all aspects of this analysis direct observations. I Will though make on comment about the matching of the last hold. There could have been a foot swap to increase the stability of the movement (obviously this is a very marginal improvement, but it could have consequences in creating bad movement patterns and in more endurance-oriented climbing). Using the opposite foot to move a hand is one of the bases of efficient climbing because it creates the most stable support base possible.

· Movement is initiated with the legs but doesn’t use full extension at the knee. This might be related with the steep angle of the wall because the move to the last hold displays full extension of the knee and significant extension at the hip.

· I will not use the Extension (body tension) parameter because this is a very subjective evaluation.

· During the climb there was a good display of movement repertoire that is appropriate to overhanging problems (heel hook), static moves (internal rotation of the supporting leg a.k.a. drop knee) and dynamic moves (external rotation of the supporting leg which potentiates the generation of movement by the leg). There was one technique that could have been employed on the second move, the back flag, to allow for a more stable base of support.

· The arms are straight at appropriate times (when repositioning the feet) and when they aren’t the angle is appropriate to maintain the upper limb muscles engaged and to utilize the spring properties of quick extension under tension.

· The tempo of the moves is adequate for the duration of the climb and its requirements in terms of foot and hand precision.

· There is some hesitation before the bigger moves. This is again marginal, but I would suggest eliminating from your climbing, especially in redpoints.

· The technique is kept consistent during the climb and even improving in the less steep section of the top out (less readjustments and better use of the legs) this is again related to the steepness of the wall and the physical nature of the moves.

· Final note: with the limited information I have on this climb it is not possible to include any more comments, in the future it is necessary to include number of attempts. Having done this process in person and online I can also add that there are factors that impact this analysis that are impossible to consider with only a video as for example: emotional state, fatigue, etc.
What does a ropes session look like for you? I'm re-reading Dave MacLeod's 9 Out of 10 Climbers book, which is incredible. Among other things, he talks about being influenced by the people and the culture around you. As an example, he says that if the people you climb with consider ten pitches in a day to be a big day, then you will consider ten pitches in a day to be a big day. It got me thinking about what people would consider normal for a day of climbing. For the purpose of this post I'm interested in roped climbing, either indoors or outdoors.

For myself, an indoor session is generally 2-3 hours, and averages around 6 pitches. Lead pitches in my gym are around 60 feet/18 meters. Probably 2-3 of these pitches will be working attempts on project level routes, in which I fall a few times, and the rest will be warm-ups and flash attempts. 

Outdoor routes at my local crag are a similar length or slightly longer than at my gym, and I usually get 4-5 routes done in a 3-4 hour session. Outdoors there's obviously more rope and gear managements, moving around, and other business to take care of that eats up time, but I also just find it more tiring,

As I plan for trips this spring, I'd like to be able to get more climbing in per day, and I'm planning on doing some bigger training days with longer hours and more routes, but I'm curious where other climbers are at.

What do your roped climbing days look like?
V12+ climbers of reddit... Help me see where I might be wrongly focused. **My Question:** What systematic things am I doing that are keeping me on the same level (V10ish)?

I am gonna tell you a bunch of random stuff about me to better direct any advice:

**About Me:**

* I'm a big dude for a boulderer. I clock in at around 175-180 and 6'2''.
* Boulderer of about 5-6 years...
* I have difficulty staying uber-lean, but I am in very athletic body composition... Prolly like 11-13% BF
* I clean up most V8s and below outside quickly. V9 can go in usually 3 sessions tops.
* I spend probably 50/50 time training and outdoor climbing, unless on trips.
* I climb WAY better outdoors than in the gym. *^((No, I don't just snipe soft climbs. I can usually do the "testpieces" for the grade)**)*
* Always try my best outside.
* My strengths are footwork and persistence...
* I climb/train 2-3 days a week if I am doing heavy training (to failure on campus + hangs + weighted pulls + abs + opposition etc...). If I am just climbing its more like 3-4 days/week outside.
* **Numbers:** (really just to give you an idea bc I'm a large dude.)
   * Max weighted pullup 180lbs + 120lbs,
   * Max hang 20mm 178lbs + 110lbs 10 sec...
   * One arm pull up goes when I'm relatively fresh (\~178lbs)
   * One arm hang on 20mm with 10lbs of assistance for like 5 sec... (\~178lbs)

# aight cool, but what's wrong?

It takes me ETERNITY to send things. My first V11, *no sending \*one\* isn't breaking the plateau*, took me 10+ sessions! Most 10s I've done take me 4-8 sessions. The issue is that years have past since my first 10, and I just don't feel like they are rolling in easier, despite my power/strength being demonstrably higher!

I often feel like I fail most because of stupid mistakes. I *almost always* do all the moves to my projects in an hour, then take 4-5 sessions to complete them. (Who tf does that?!?)

**Thoughts:**

* I have a dogshit strength to weight ratio... (but I won't be shrinking or getting bird legs anytime soon.)
* Maybe I am resting too much? I often go for long rest-day chunks (2+ days) just to ensure that i am fully recovered to make the best of my next workout. Maybe that is resulting in less movement-time just straight climbing?
* Maybe I am not just climbing outside enough? Maybe my constant mistakes are a result of strength that isn't ready to be directly applied to the wall yet?
* Maybe I need to do more power endurance or volume days?

I am an over-thinker and a nerd. That's how I approach things like this.

There is something &gt;!I am too bad to see!&lt; holding me back, and I feel like another set of eyes might help.

Any input from people in the game longer or who are just better is much appreciated.
technique analysis #2 Hello again,

I'm trying to make these shorter. Here is the second one. This one is a lot more specific in its application because it was a multi-session project and the route so this might only be relevant for similar contexts (other redpoints) and may not be the best description of the climbers ability. When i first saw the video I hesitated in analysing it because it looked really solid in terms of technique. Still there is something to learn from this performance so I did it anyways.

Again, any questions feel free to ask. I might not reply immediatly because I am having classes at the moment. I will try to do one analysis per day. I got more replies to my original post than i expected so I am now offering an Analysis+Training plan package to those interested. The training plan will include onde training session taylored to your needs and options to make the exercises harder or easier to progress over a week of training.

Video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agQG8KcYsm8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agQG8KcYsm8) 

Technique analysis:

· The hands are all precisely placed first time and the adjustments are used to maximize contact area with the holds (i.e.: shoving your fingers in holes on the wall).

· The feet are all precisely placed first time with one exception the hole route. There were few adjustments for the first 2/3 of the route but they increased near the top (probably related with the emotional state of the climber since this was a successful redpoint attempt). It is important to note that the adjustments that occurred did not result in oscillations of the center of mass. There is though a constant “jerk” whenever there is a new foothold before weight being transferred that could be eliminated.

· Movements are all in balance and in control (it would be interesting to evaluate to what extent this is maintained during Onsight’s or routes with fewer attempts).

· All the moves were fluid and linked in quick succession.

· The exploratory moves were kept to short visual exploration of the target hold.

· The direction of the holds required smaller arm to forearm angles but still the climber displays extension at the knee coordinated with the arm extension/ forearm flexion (pulling with the arm)

· It is hard to judge the repertoire of movement because the moves were similar in nature and required no heel hooks, toe hooks, etc.

· The arms were straight at appropriate times given the direction of the holds

· The tempo of movement does not reflect the difficulty of the sections and was kept constant (maybe because the type of holds and moves require precision). 

· There is only one move were there was hesitation obviously as a result of the emotional state of being near the top of the route potentially the climber has fallen on this move before.

· There is a good use of rests and in appropriate body position (straight arms, center of mass low and close to the wall).

· Clipping is done effortlessly throughout the route and in stable positions (same as the resting position above).

· There is a good display of consistency except for what I assumed to be the impact of the emotional state of the climber which should be a separate discussion to this analysis given the complexity of the topic.
Question: Do fingers get wider with training? I’ve seen many pictures of professional climbers hands, and their fingers are always so wide. I’ve watched Adam Ondra’s video where he describes the perfect climber and he mentions wide, shorter fingers, due to the leverage and surface area advantages that gives you. I’ve always had long, skinny fingers. I now climb V7 and 12b, but I haven’t noticed any change in the way my hands look. Has anyone noticed a change in their hands throughout the course of their training?
Shoe rubber technology: why performance is better in colder conditions? I was wondering, why does shoe rubber seem to work better in colder temperatures? I am also a fan of Motorsport racing and it seems that tire heat is a very critical part in maintaining traction to the point that some rubber compounds must be pre heated before someone can even race on them. This seems to be the opposite with climbing rubbers, why is that? For example, some summer race tires I’ve used are so sticky they pick up pebbles on the road. It seems like taking a page from racing rubbers might be beneficial for climbing. For what it’s worth I heard a scarpa rep say that there just isn’t the funding for the kind of R&amp;D that a race team for F1 would have but it seems like the tech would be able to piggyback in some way. Would love to hear some more critical discussion on shoe rubber compounds and idea performance temperatures.

Edit: on a side note, has there ever been a climbing shoe deemed too sticky? I’ve heard tale of people using resins or honey to create artificial friction on their hands but I’m sure that trend died out in the 70s. Correct me if I’m wrong though!
Is anyone else better at bouldering despite being a sport climber? I sport climb 80% of the times indoors and boulder for the rest of the times. Despite this, my bouldering grades are way higher than my leading grades. I would say that I flash 75% of the V5 and will succeed the rest of them in less than 3 attempts. I can also complete around 25% of the V6. But when it comes to lead climbing, it's totally different: I can redpoint 5.10a and barely 5.10b.

At first I thought that it was just the bouldering grades of my gym that were soft. But clearly it is not the case since the people that I see struggling on the same problem as me are leading above the 5.11a.
What do you do on your recovery days? I recently listened to TrainingBeta’s podcast ‘5.11 Climber Hayley Thomas Gets Coached by Matt Pincus’ and realized I should rethink my recovery plan
Curious about my hands having different preferences on the same hold I've started noticing this ever since I started training on the Tension Board (due to the symmetry). My left hand heavily prefers to take everything as a pinch, gaining what purchase I can from the bottom of the TB edges. Full crimping never feels as comfy or strong. But my right hand wants to full crimp everything. Locking my thumb over feels so solid. From Lattice test-style measurements, I know my right half crimp is moderately weaker than my left (bout a grade difference). 

I was wondering if anyone else experienced something like this. And more importantly, is it worth focusing on (like forcing the weaker/non-preference while training) or is it fine to just let my hands do whatever they want?
Best video series for learning technique? I've seen a lot of book recommendations out there, but I think videos make more sense (on youtube or otherwise). Anybody able to recommend a good bouldering / indoor climbing video series, especially starting from the beginner level?
Hamstring strength for heel hooks I have noticed that my hamstrings are pretty injury prone when I'm working problems with heel hooks. I have had them fully cramp up after projecting problems with heel hooks outdoors. And I just recently strained the top of my hamstring whilst heel hooking in the gym. My technique seems fine (although it's something I'll continue to look at), and my flexibility is not too bad either (it's also something I'm working on). I also warm up thoroughly before climbing, including active mobility work for the lower body and avoid static stretching before climbing. So I figure it's a strength issue. 

So, my questions are:

1.  what are some good excercises for the hamstrings  that can preferably be performed without much equipment (i.e. only dumbbells, and excercise bands etc.) that might help build strength for heel hooks. 

2. What sort of rep range/frequency should i be looking at given that my main interest is injury prevention? Not sure if I should be aiming for neurological strength gains, hypertrophy, conditioning, or something else...

3. How should leg work be programmed with climbing and antagonist work? Right now I do climbing specific training (i.e. climbing and/or hangboarding + pulling stuff and core) on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, antagonist work (i.e. pushing movements + TRX compression stuff) on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and flexibility work over the weekend. Where would (fairly minimal) leg training best fit into that? 

4. Any other tips for avoiding injury when heel hooking? 

p.s. sorry if this belongs in the injury thread. I figured it wasn't such a common question so maybe deserved a thread of its own.
What does your training log look like? I'm curious as to how everyone here logs their training. Excel? Paper? An App? Website?

Post some pics of your training log! I'll start it off with my [2019 training log](https://imgur.com/A2UDG16.png), Some months have flags next to them representing the country I visited for climbing. The 23rd of December is a darker shade of red because I destroyed my heel on a highball, so I'll be doing mostly hangboarding in 2020
This is my first attempt on a portable hangboard. It was all made from scrap wood and almost didn‘t cost me anything to make. What do you think?
What to do/change when a climbing slump hits? Every couple of months I hit a span of 2-3 weeks where my climbing ability just goes to hell - endurance, power, and strength all feel grades below the last “good” day of climbing. Usually it feels like this just comes out of nowhere.  My climbing sessions in the gym are never to the point of total fatigue.  Apart from gym and outdoor climbing (3-4 days a week) I do some light hangboarding (75-80% max) and lifting 1-2 times a week, usually after climbing sessions.  Does anyone else experience this and does anyone have a remedy for these consistent downturns?  I’ve done a search and asked some friends but it seems like no one else gets it to this degree.  I could use some advice, thanks!
Women of r/climbharder My wife is almost to the point where she wants to chose her nails over climbing, because climbing is so hard on her nails.
Any tips/tricks to prevent nail damage? She wants to send that 11d, but have pretty nails at the top

Edit: she currently does the gel nail polish with the UV light at home. Her nails are cut short but when they are unpainted, they break past the point, over the bed causing them to bleed sometimes. Any tips for strengthening nails?
How much harder is onsighting vs redpointing? Let me please re-post here the following analyses from my rock climbing and Statistics blog *Climbstat* ( [https://climbstat.blogspot.com](https://climbstat.blogspot.com) ) because I think this might be interesting for you.   
Please comment, criticize and provide your thoughts!  

&amp;#x200B;

[**How much harder is onsighting vs redpointing?**](http://climbstat.blogspot.com/2020/02/how-much-harder-is-onsighting-vs.html)

Every rock climber knows that a successful onsight is much harder than an ascent with perfect beta after rounds of projecting. An onsight means climbing a route successfully at the first attempt without prior information or rehearsal on the route. During an onsight, we might not know where the crux lies or how long the route actually is. In contrast, being able to learn about a route, to mentally accommodate to the hard sections, the rest points and footholds, allows us to reach our maximum performance during a redpoint ascent.

Most of us also have a good sense of the routes we typically can climb in a first attempt with or without prior knowledge or in a second or subsequent attempt. But it is much harder to guess how much more difficult, let’s say an onsight ascent is, compared to a successful redpoint ascent. We might know that Adam Ondra did Silence (9c or 5.15d), currently the world’s hardest route, after weeks of practicing specifically for that route. Adam was also the first to flash a route of the grade 9a+ or 5.15a (a flash means a successful ascent of a route in the first go with prior information, for example from other climbers), and he did three 9a or 5.14d onsight. Alex Megos ,however,was the first to onsight a 9a or 5.14d, he climbed up to 9b+ (redpoint). Up to today, no one onsighted a route harder than 9a. But is the difference between 9b+ redpoint and 9a onsight an meaningful estimate of how much harder an onsight is? A first attempt without beta might be easier among lower-graded routes compared to the elite level. Here, we want to investigate this question in a quantitative way.

As in a [previous articles](https://climbstat.blogspot.com/), we will therefore access the data of the website [8a.nu](https://8a.nu) which provides climbers with the opportunity to save their climbs and view personal scorecards. A scorecard is simply an overview about routes achieved, the respective style and the grade among others. In this article, we look at the maximum onsight and the maximum redpoint grade of [8a.nu](https://8a.nu) users who made their scorecard public. We focus here on climbers who climbed redpoint at least 6a or 5.10a or higher. The available dataset covers entries up to September 2017. This leaves us with almost 18,000 climbers.

How do the results look like? First, we take a look at the overall difference between the maximum (redpoint) performance and the maximum onsight performance. The following graph shows the distribution of maximum performance for each climber in our dataset by style. This kind of graph is called a violin graph. The wider the violin, the more climbers there are with a certain maximum redpoint or onsight performance. The average maximum performance by style is illustrated by the black point in the middle of the violin. The average maximum redpoint performance is slightly above 7b+ or 5.12c. This is partly due to the fact that we disregarded climbers who do not climb above 6a or 5.10b. Apart from that the average ability of active [8a.nu](https://8a.nu) users is quite high. Climbers who do not climb very often don’t bother much about creating and maintaining a public scorecard. The corresponding maximum onsight performance is slightly above 7a or 5.11d. This indicates that the average onsight level is approximately three grades below the maximum performance.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dst3ia1jkth41.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ee2196544f98ba56b1a93ff188067292443258d

Next, we want to investigate whether the results differ across the performance spectrum. For this purpose, we group all climbers together by their maximum (redpoint) performance on their scorecard. Now we look at the average maximum onsight performance within each group.

How does this grouping work and how did we finally calculate the average onsight performance? Let us take those climbers who sent 9b+ or 5.15c as maximum (regardless of whether they are included in the [8a.nu](https://8a.nu) data). These are Stefano Ghisolfi, Alexander Megos and Chris Sharma (Adam Ondra is not included in this list despite the fact that he did three 9b+ because of his 9c redpoint). Alexander Megos did an 9a onsight while Stefano Ghisolfi and Chris Sharma onsighted up to 8c at maximum, according to Wikipedia. The onsight average of this group is therefore slightly below 8c+.

The following graph shows how the redpoint-onsight performance gap across all grades. On the x-axis, we have plotted the maximum (redpoint) performance. The y-axis shows the maximum onsight performance. If climbers onsighted grades similar to their redpoint performance, we would see a straight 45 degree line (indicated in red). The onsight performance is as one would expect, lower than the maximum performance and this is why the blue points are below the red line. It is apparent that the difference is small for climbers with a relatively low maximum performance and it widens for higher able climbers. This indicates that an onsight becomes harder the harder you climb. The average onsight maximum is 2-3 grades lower for climbers who climb up to 7a or 5.11d redpoint but it increases to almost 4 grades for climbers with a maximum grade of 8a or 5.13b (and still widens further). Interestingly, the gap again seems to be a little lower for the few climbers who can climb 9b or 5.15b or higher.

&amp;#x200B;

We have not considered flash ascents in this article. The reason is that there is almost no difference between the maximum onsight and flash performance in the [8a.nu](https://8a.nu) data. The highest flash grades are higher than the average onsight grades but the difference is very small (ca. ⅙ of the difference between one grade or between 7a and 7a+). Personally, we think this seems surprising since a good beta might indeed give you valuable information.

My max hang weight benchmarks me as a V9/10 climber. I've been stuck at V6/7 for 2 years. My fingers seem significantly weaker than the actual V9/10 climbers in my gym. What is holding me back? I've been plateaued at the V6/7 level for about 2 years now, mainly just been doing on-the-wall workouts from the Crimpd app such as Strength Intervals, Style Triad, and 6 in 6 with the occasional pull ups, push ups, and core workouts. In my six years doing this sport, I've dedicated a lot of my effort towards working on my overhang climbing technique as much as possible as it is what I enjoy the most - basically I just want to preface that I don't think technique is what has been holding me back from progressing in grades, at least on what I enjoy climbing. (I religiously studied and followed the Neil Gresham master class when I was younger. Video of me on an indoor V6 for a technique reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/bouldering/comments/cwfhjg/finally_sent_this_fun_v6_that_ive_been_working/)

Recently I started doing max hangs twice a week in an attempt to improve my finger strength because I've always self-diagnosed my reasoning for plateauing as being that my fingers aren't as strong as the climbers in my gym at the V8-V10 level. However, after looking at a lot of old threads: https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/6ios68/web_app_bouldering_grade_to_max_hang/ in this subreddit regarding finger strength benchmarks for corresponding V-grade, it seems that my fingers are actually stronger than the grade that I climb. (I hung 105 lbs at 160 lbs bodyweight off of the outer top edge of the Trango Rock Prodigy, which according to this review: https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/reviews/climbing/hangboard/trango-rock-prodigy-training-center is a 3/4" or ~ 19 mm edge.)

This seems a little ridiculous to me since this would benchmark me as a V10 climber which I am no where close to reaching. I kind of share the same sentiment with this comment thread in the same post: https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/6ios68/web_app_bouldering_grade_to_max_hang/dj85kee/ with a guy who hangs around the same % of bodyweight as me but considers his finger strength unremarkable. Looking at the V9-V10 climbers at my gym, they casually latch onto holds that are limit moves for me, and it is very clear from watching them climb that they have significantly stronger fingers due to their stability on holds that I have to full crimp bear down on.

This is also in conjunction with the fact that I am decently heavier than my peers of the same height. (I am 5'8" at 160 lbs and around 17% body fat whereas most of my climbing friends at my height - or even those taller than me at around 6' weigh in at the 130 - 140 lb range.) Which has also had me self-diagnose weight as one of the reasons I have plateaued. 

So, what I am doing wrong? Are the finger strength benchmarks I looked at incorrect and I actually do need to make my fingers stronger? Should I focus on losing some body fat and weight? Is my technique actually a lot shittier than I think?

The Anatomy of Tendon Strength Hi all,

As a relatively new climber, everyone tells you that tendon strength ‘takes time’ and is super specific to climbing. However, I am having a difficult time finding any articles on how stronger tendons ‘work.’ I understand how a rupture could occur if your muscles can provide significantly more force than your tendon can handle. However, how do stronger tendons themselves help you climb (let’s assume injury is not going to happen)?  Can tendons fail under load without injury? Given two people with the same muscular strength, could one person grip more based on their tendon strength (rhetorical)? If so, how?

Thank you in advance.
Advice on how to improve on my biggest weakness! Earlier this week I went about trying to diagnose my biggest weakness. I find it very hard to pull far and lock off with one arm when my shoulders are facing the wall e.g left hand low, right foot quite high and far away and then reaching up to a hold with my right hand statically (around 105 - 115 degree overhang).

I have come to the conclusion that I practically can't and don't engage my back and shoulders at all. My pecs make up for my lack of a strong back and I feel it is super hard to focus on my back muscles on these types of moves.

1. What kind of exercises would be best for this kind of movement specifically facing the wall with no twisting?
2. Should I prioritize fixing this imbalance(?) or just carry on climbing normally with the added back exercises incorporated into training.
3. Would I benefit from strength training using a bar and plates? e.g. overhead press/shoulder press

Edit: I am comfortable with fairly long duration (15sec max) one arm lockoffs on a pullup bar
How do I practice technique without a second person watching? Hi all

I want to sharpen up my technique. What's the best way to go about this without having someone else watch you climb and then critique? I think my technique is fine overall but think that it can be improved what's the best way of going about this?

Kind of related I also want to improve my tactics and route reading I end up just blundering into a climb either without enough thought or I don't see crucial things or the places to apply different techniques, how do I go about training that?

Cheers!
How much does the pair of shoes you're climbing with influence your performance mentally? I currently own two pairs of climbing shoes (Solutions and Evolv Kronos), I bought the kronos as a 2nd more comfortable pair for those longer sessions where I want to focus more on technique and don't want the discomfort that comes with a higher performance shoes, last night in the gym I started attempting routes that I would normally feel comfortable with my solutions, in the kronos and didn't feel like my head was there and was getting frustrated, swapped shoes and felt comfortable. 

so my question is whether that is a bad mentality to have when comes to shoes, that i can only perform with a certain pair, and if that if i work on tougher routes with less that "ideal" shoes would that somehow improve my footwork or mentally towards it?
Don't give up on your training program and keep pushing! This is a post I wanted to write for a couple of weeks, ever since I had this mini "enlightenment", but first things first:

I was a boulderer for 6 years, no special program or idea what I was doing except having fun (up to V5s).  
I started a slow semi-transition to route climbing 2 years ago and could not get passed a 6C for over 15 months. While I knew this was acceptable given the time frame, a life event lead to asses what was important to me, and how do I want to prioritize things and I've decided to take a remote coach that prepared a program and is answering any question I have over the phone.  


I was training for 9 long months on the fingerboard, general fitness, endurance, and technique, all the while feeling physically stronger but not as a climber. I was climbing the exact same grades, and worse - I had a physical slump every once in a while draining my body completely forcing me to take long rests (days).  


I started to stop believing in what I was doing and lost motivation, I kept a strict log of my training shared with my coach and completely stopped filling the comment section, for long weeks it said "IM DEAD", "ZERO POWER", "WTF IS WRONG WITH ME", yet my coach kept pushing me, he said "performance and training don't go together" and "you have to work hard before you can climb hard".  


Not sure how he got some sense into my head and I kept pushing and training. I slowly started to see changes but they were mild, very mild. I started to feel a bit stronger, less pumped, more controlled. I was climbing the same grades but \*better\*.  
Until a few weeks ago, I wasn't sure if I was imagining a progression or is it really there and I asked my coach for advice on my very long fingerboard plateau in terms of how much weight I could take.  
His advice was "keep going, but do not touch a fingerboard for one whole week".   


BOOM. It cannot sound any stupider than it already is so I'll just say it - my climbing just SKYROCKETED from this second on. On the first week after laying low on the training after all those months, I sent my first V7 and almost completed a 7B (mind you I only sent a handful of 7As until then). When I went back to the fingerboard training I was able to add 15% extra weight and finished all my sets leaving room for some more.  


I do not know if these are directly connected but I don't have any other explanation, but the hard fact is that determination and dedication yield results. It takes time, especially when it comes to sport climbing, but it happens, so as Dave Macleod says in his awesome ["How to hangboard" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKE5VH5-qg): "**MY MESSAGE IS: STICK AT IT**!"  


That's it, I hope this motivational message find someone who needs it as I needed it for so long...  


[As a bonus here's a short part of me going 200% of my last lattice power endurance assessment...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmRhrENotM4)
Simplest hangboard protocol? Went to Dave MacLeod masterclass and he told me in person that hangboard time under tension while doing max hangs is small and that everyone should do max hangs pretty much every day if you have the time.  According to him as long as you can have high-quality hangboard sessions then you can do it every day AND the hangs must be maximal.

I might not agree with this advice personally since I feel like I would be destroyed, but if coaches like him say these things I believe questions like yours are just irrelevant.

&amp;#x200B;

The algorithm according to Dave Mc:

While you can do high-quality max hangs:

1. Hang with max effort
2. Once quality degrades - stop
3. Try next day
Problems Disappearing from Moonboard App? Anyone else had this issue? Last week I was working "Borneo," a Benchmark V6. Wanted to light it up yesterday and it was just gone from my logbook and I couldn't find it in the search. In that same session I was working "Northside," another Benchmark V6. Switched to another problem for someone else and then went to look for "Northside" again and it was just gone. Not in my logbook, not listed in the search app. Anyone else run into this??

Edit: Looks like it's fixed! At least for the BM V6's...
Search-by-holds for Moonboard More than occasionally, I have wanted to use a certain hold or find easier/harder variations of a problem.

So I built it! [http://www.moonboard.rocks/](http://www.moonboard.rocks/)

&amp;#x200B;

Any comments/feedback? There are a few bugs with the buttons not matching the values initially, but mostly it works.  


Edit: There is some problem that it keeps crashing, you can try and use this so I'll have the chance to see what might cause it a bit more easily: [http://dev.scajanus.django.group/](http://dev.scajanus.django.group/)
9 years just climbing starting to train for real **tl;dr**

## early 2019
I was feeling strong, climbing a lot and felt like i was "training". Gotten a few v7, touching v8s. Send some Moonboard v5 starting looking at some v6s (Genesis Chain, Birthday Boulder). Bought a second crashpad. Resoled all my wornout shoes and got some new ones. 

Jumped on the campus board one day because it was there. A month or two before a planned Yosemite trip.  Tweaked ulnar side wrist thing.  Could not pull up on underclings. Right middle finger pulley was getting more aggravated but it felt ok to climb on.

- **Goal**:  moonboard v6, Tree route V4
- **What was I doing to get better**: There's something about pushing hard with my toes? Moonboard.
- **Best outdoors send**: Bate's Arete V4, Zorro V4 (Yosemite), Kor Problem V3 (Yosemite), Birthing Experience V3 (Berkeley)

- **Goal**: Breaking a lot of bad habits. Not getting more injured.
- **What was I doing to get better**: using my core and legs. Initiating movement. Looking at the toe. actually smearing. Flash goes.
- **Best outdoors send**: Lost Keys Traverse v6

## 2020
After about 6 months of wrist stretches the wrists finally feel better. The tweaky pulley has not gotten better. Focus on rehab: tendon glides. Started hangboarding. Hoping to do 2x a week, add weight, forever protocol. 

- **Goal**: Base of outdoor moderates. Outdoor trips: Joes (mid March), Tahoe (sept?), Yosemite(May?). 
- **What was I doing to get better**: Journaling everything, 2x week hangboarding, Getting outdoors more. Learning to do very few, high quality efforts indoors/boards. Be less anti-social.
- **Best outdoors send**: Tree route V4, Duct Tape V5, Nature Nazi Arete V7(soft)


## Long term goals
I'm 36 now. 5'10 150lb. I have some audacious goal to send some benchmark outdoor v8s before I'm 40. Not sure what my training goals are but the mindfulness and technique "training" has been amazing. I feel I'm able to properly use the strength I have.
Training while pregnant and through infant stages I'm at that stage where all my friends are pregnant or have kids/toddlers. Its mostly &lt;1yr olds at this point but as we watch them do the parent thing, leaves me wondering if anyone has/knows how to "continue" training through this period. I'd hate to see the past few years of work decline (but priorities).
Bouldering without an ACL - yes or no? So i tore my ACL last May bouldering, completely ruptured it, as well as tearing my meniscus and MCL. I had an operation initially to repair the meniscus, but i haven't had my ACL repaired yet, and i dont think i want to. Most of my surgeons/ physios have recommended that ACL reconstruction is becoming a more outdated procedure, and they think that im doing well enough without an ACL to warrant not needing the op. (im also self employed so having a long time off work again is a no go)

So my question is: does anyone have any experience/ knowledge of bouldering without an ACL? i've got back into sport climbing which i'm finding absolutely fine, but bouldering is obviously more of a worry. Bouldering has always been my preferred discipline, so its left a real void in my life. I used to climb around V7/V8 before my injury, and at that level downclimbing wasn't always possible/ you naturally fall off a lot. Obviously i dont want to injure myself again, but id love to get back into bouldering. 

If anyone has any advice id really appreciate it!
Improving finger mobility ? Hey,

As years of climbing (and training) goes, I feel that I'm loosing mobility in my fingers. For example, I cannot fully flex my middle fingers (L + R). Any tips to gain back some mobility ?
Loading for fingerboard training (overhead vs other options) Over the weekend a bunch of our national team has been visiting gyms, and I chatted with some of the coaches.

Given most of the competitors are climbing 5-6 days a week, and shoulders can only take so much load, they all do their fingerboard work seated on a yoga matt, with a loop around their feet, pulling in.

I asked why, and was told

1. less load on the shoulders
2. good scap training, teaching pull back shoulderblades
3. actively stretching dorsiflexion of the ankles at the same time
4. easier to teach 'try harder' as they are really actively pulling

He said they had tried devices that hang the weight below, and he thought it was not specific enough.

On some of the devices, they had a way to test load pulled, and they had to do repeated sets until they say a determined amount of diminished strength

Thought you guys might find that tidbit interesting. I'm going to try it this week (which works well, as I've twinged a shoulder on a compressiony problem). Almost all the sets were open hang, first three and back three, they don't do any overload work in the full crimp
"Climbing hard on a full time job" article from Lattice: anything similar around to draw ideas from? As per topic!

Context: my new job is demanding as hell, as they keep on changing requirements at the last minute and I find myself working through a schedule that is not necessarily random, but has days (like today and, unfortunately, yesterday) that drain all of my mental capacity and all of my energy due to frustration and volume of work that keeps being changed 1-2 days ahead of deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

Since at the moment I'm still wondering whether I'm due a move or not from this manic place, I'm after articles/podcasts I can read and listen to about structuring training and plans around such a silly work schedule. I have more or less come up with a "low volume - perceived-high as hell intensity" to maximise my time and efficiency, but I'm still keen on exploring options and drawing hype and ideas from sources. The [Lattice's article](https://latticetraining.com/2019/10/02/climbing-hard-on-a-full-time-job/) is one good starting point, as well as [Will Anglin's episode on Training Beta](https://www.trainingbeta.com/media/will-anglin/) and again a [Lattice article about 1-hour sessions](https://www.trainingbeta.com/transcript-highlight-lattice-training-on-the-perfect-1-hour-session/)

Other somewhat related resources I find helpful/inspirational:

\- [https://latticetraining.com/2019/04/15/training-lessons-from-the-over-50s/](https://latticetraining.com/2019/04/15/training-lessons-from-the-over-50s/) (I'm almost 35, but it puts in perspective to what I should probably focus towards)

FWIW: I'm mostly a boulderer with particular training focus on strength and power, with the occasional pre-trad-climbing-trip bouts of endurance (or I-need-fitness-must-do-100-laps-on-circuits)
Has anyone tried the Samsara Mountain Training bodyweight program? I heard about this on the Training Beta podcast and I was really interested in trying it out... until I saw that it costs $350. I can’t think of any training related thing I’ve spent that much on. 
https://www.samsaramtntraining.com
Still- there’s something by about having a systematic program that I can do in my office that’s intriguing. 
Out of curiosity, has anyone here tried this out yet?
Realization: I need to train less: So, I really don't want to come off as bragging, but I had a realization recently while watching an Emil Abrahamnsson video about training for v15.

I don't really need to get stronger physically at the moment. The things holding me back are my attitude, my dedication to seeing things through, and my commitment to climbing rather than training.

I realized I probably have spend 60% of my gym time the last year or so in the training area, 35% climbing in the gym, and 5% (is that math right?) trying my "projects." I make excuses to go to the gym instead of my CLOSE TO HOME (literally on the way to or home from work, if I go the long way) projects.

I don't take my own training, climbing, nutrition, or life advice. 

So, what am I going to do?

1. Hangboard and train when I want to, because I want to not because I feel like I need to.
2. Prioritize real life stuff, then climbing, then training.
3. Project more. I am going to try to climb outside 1x per week minimum. Even with shitty weather.
4. I am going to speak to myself the way I would speak to a client/other person. Stern, but compassionate. Understanding, but no excuses.
5. Eat enough protein, but not hate myself for eating tasty snacks. Stop weighting myself so much, base food on how I feel rather than how I want to feel.
6. Just plain get after it. Stop being a hypocrite, become a hardman. Just do it. Punch the clock in the gym and rocks, and just make it happen.
My fear immobilizes me from becoming a better climber I’ve been climbing for about a year now and can’t seem to get over my fear of heights. Some days I do very well and other days the fear kicks in and I cant climb something I’ve previously climbed before. This fear has stopped me from improving to become a better climber. I have developed the strength however my mind doesn’t let me go further. There have been times where I’m climbing and have exceptional footwork, but then when I get half way and look down, I lose that mental ability to know where to put my feet or hands and I just end up not finishing the climb. How do I overcome this fear? I’ve been pushing myself over and over again but the fear just lingers. It seems like nothing is helping. I was thinking of using CBD before a climb to calm myself. Do you guys have any recommendations on how to conquer this? If so please let me know!


Update: I boulder and I see that a lot of you guys climb lead and have mentioned to practice falling. My fear of heights starts when I’m half way up toward the top out.  Sometimes being half way up means I’m more than 6 feet off the ground.. I guess.... how would I practice falling from that?

Also thank you so much for the advice! I really appreciate it!

Update: I also forgot to mention that I did badly sprain/broke my ankle from climbing when I first started which was two years ago. It took about a year to fully heal so that’s when I decided to get back into it. A part of my fear is probably because of the past trauma as well.
Reasonable Goals? Hi all,

I’ve been climbing for a little over a year now, and I’ve been getting into outdoor bouldering over the past month. One of my goals for this year was to send this one classic outdoors V7 in my area by the end of the year. I tried it the other day for the first time and surprised myself. I think it will go either next session or shortly after. I estimated myself to be about an outdoors V3 level at the start of the year, but I’ve done some classic V5s and a V6 since then. 

Am I setting myself up for disappointment if I set a new goal for 2020 to climb an outdoors V9? I am going to continue to train a lot and I know my weaknesses pretty well. My core and fingers are relatively weak, and I could use more volume on real rock too to increase my familiarity with it.

I know grade chasing isn’t necessarily the best mentality, but this sort of numerical progression is a big motivator and source of joy for me (not just in climbing). I’m not too sure what the difference in difficulty between a solid V7 and a solid V9 boulder is. And I’m also not sure what a reasonable amount of time is or effort it takes to make that jump. 

Thanks for the help!
Technique/Style I've been climbing for around 15 years, climb V12/13, and still feel like my technique sucks. I want to have a more fluid style, rather than being so thuggy. It's something I've spent time with ever since I was coming up as a comp kid. And I feel like at this point in my career, I can barely tell what constitutes "good technique". So I guess my question is, how can I tell if I'm climbing correctly? And how can I shift my climbing style after having spent so long ingraining my current one?
How are your 2020 goals going? A while back, this was posted: https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/ebndrs/whats_your_2020_climbing_goal_how_are_you_going/

Hopefully, everyone's enjoying the year, crushing projects, and staying on track. How are your goals going? Did you add any? Drop any? What are you ahead or behind on? What have you learned or improved at?

Personally, one of my biggest goals was at least 25 days outside this year. I'm super lucky to live close to local crags and I'm getting my 10th day in on Saturday. Well ahead of schedule. One goal of mine I'm pretty bad at is doing my supplemental work like weights and warmups and mobility work. And the thing I really learned is falling on a highball top out freaking hurts and I should probably only do highballs with a spotter. Thank satan for crash pads.
50% increase in maximal hang after first 6 week max-hang cycle: sharing my plan for others. _Preface_: I did not invent this plan so I'm sure this already exists somewhere else on the internet, I figured I'd share it anyways to help anyone here looking to get started on their first max hang session.

I found this plan primarily useful as a climber that sits on the heavier side for their weight class (5'11 165lb ~22.5 BMI), since it's progression is proportional to your body weight. The results below are from _only_ max hangs, I didn't perform any climbing what so ever during this 6 week cycle due to having shattered my heel from a bad bouldering fall in December.

* Week 1 Maximal Hang: **55lb** added weight at 7s
* Week 6 Maximal Hang: **80lb** added weight at 7s
 * Technically this was week 8, as I had one week where I was out of town and another week where I was sick and didn't perform any max hangs during that time.

I'm pretty stoked at the gains, while numbers like these don't always translate 100% to crimping on real rock, I think it's evidence that max hangs are giving me stronger fingers.

**Plan:**
----------------

Everything below assumes you're half-crimping on a 20mm hangboard edge and have properly warmed up beforehand (30+ minutes). These hangs should be done at the *beginning* of a training session, not the end! Leave 48-72 hours in between max hangs sessions and don't go over two sessions a week, think quality not quantity. If you're new to hangboarding like I was, I'd recommend 72 hours in between max hang sessions.

Each session only takes ~30m to perform discounting the warmup, and is mostly comprised of resting. You shouldn't break a sweat and it should almost feel like you aren't doing anything, but trust the process.

* **Day 1 (Assessment)**: Starting with body weight, hang^[1] for 7s on your edge and rest 1-4m. Add weight on each further rep until you fail; try to add weight such that you arrive at your max in 4-6 reps after your body weight. TRY HARD on this assessment, the next 6 weeks will be based off this number. Once you determine your max, add that number to your body weight for your max hang weight. e.g. since I found my first max was 55lb, and weigh 165lb, my max hang weight was 220lb.

* **Weeks 1-2**: 8 sets of 7s hangs, 1-3m rest in between @ 85% max hang weight
 * To calculate how much weight to add, take 85% of your max hang weight and subtract your body weight
 * Using the same example above, 85% for me meant (220 * .85) - 165 = 22lb added weight
* **Weeks 3-4**: 8 sets of 7s hangs, 1-3m rest in between @ 90% max hang weight
* **Weeks 5-6**: 8 sets of 7s hangs, 1-3m rest in between @ 95% max hang weight

After week 6, re-measure your max hangs and make sure to flex your new numbers on instagram while fighting off the dread of being unable to climb.

Coronavirus Quarantine Training Hi all,

The coronavirus outbreak is getting pretty bad in my city to the point that I suspect that my local gym will close down for at least 2-3 weeks in the upcoming week or two, and I wouldn't be surprised if the whole city gets quarantined.  I have a portable metolius hangboard, a pullup bar, and various light weights. Unfortunately, I don't think that I can climb outside because I don't have crash pads (will buy a couple soon though) and I don't have any experience with lead belaying.

I  only do bouldering at the moment, so my training is mostly finger strength/power related. I currently try to climb or train 4-5 times a week, and am climbing at v7. My current climbing training regime is 2 days on 1 day off (sometimes I take 2 rests days when I feel too tired), where I just do climbing and projecting the first day, then do core/antagonist/tension board/movement related climbing on the second day. I would say that power endurance and finger strength are some of my strong spots in climbing right now, and I really do not want to lose my strength. 

So considering the worst case scenario where I can't really climb for the next 5 weeks or so, I was wondering what kind of training regime I can do at home to preserve the most possible strength so that I can go back to climbing in the summer strong and hopefully climb my goal of outdoors V7 by the end of the summer.

Furthermore, let me know if there are good climbing related training gear that I should get to really keep my strength.

Thank you all.
Is it time to start easing into hangboarding/training, or still in the "just climb" stage? Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been climbing for around 10-11 months now. I've primarily spent that time bouldering and I'm able to climb a majority of V3+ and project most V4 to V4+. However, my greatest weakness by far is my finger strength, to the point that even some crimpy V2's can give me problems. Every time my gym puts up a crimp-heavy route in my grade level I tend to focus on it to build finger strength and work my technique/foot placement to shift as much of the load off my fingers as is possible. But, unfortunately these crimp-heavy problems are few and far between at my gym around my climbing grade.

&amp;#x200B;

I've followed the "just climb" advice for beginners so far for almost a year. I've dropped from 220 lbs to 180 lbs (trying to get to 165) to make climbing easier and to lessen the load on my tendons. I know that many advise against focused training and/or hangboarding for starting out to avoid injury, but I'm wondering if I may be at the stage that it wouldn't be a bad idea to slowly ease into hangboarding. Or would it be better to wait a little longer? The other issue is I'm around 45 mins from my closest gym location so it would be nice to have a way to train at home more than I already do (I use my pullup bar and do core training at home).

&amp;#x200B;

Edit (March 11th): I wanted to say a HUGE thank you for everyone that has chipped in to this discussion. I've spent a lot of time reading everyone's comments. Most of these comments lead to me spending about 3.5 hours last night going down rabbit hole after rabbit hole of climbing write-ups and videos. After reading everything I found last night and here on this post, I think I'm going to give it a good 2 more months or so. Take those couple months and focus on hitting the gym more, with less excuses for not going, and try to bring good intention and focus for each session. After those two months, I'll reassess how I should approach this problem moving forward. Who knows, like others have mentioned, I may realize that finger strength isn't what I was lacking after all. I appreciate all the advice!
Request: How to believe you can do it, when you know you can't I'm a trad climber who's moved to sport and bouldering.  I've noticed a key impediment seems to be trying really hard when things are beyond my ability.  I've always approached trad climbing with a do or die kind of approach.  I fall occasionally but I usually climb with the mindset that I'm not coming off.    As I've turned my attention to sport climbing, I don't have a problem trying hard and falling.  Fear of roped falls is not my issue.   However, I have noticed when I boulder on limit problems I have a hard time believing in myself.  This sounds kind of corny but it seems like trying hard requires the inherent belief each time that you will send.   I seem to approach maximal bouldering and harder sport routes with the mindset that I know I can't do it.  Not because i have a defeatist attitude (can't never could) but because i just know that i cant.  It gets frustrating to feel like I am working above my pay grade and being right about that.  Especially when the key lacking ingredient seems to be the determination and conviction that this is the send go.  I just don't believe so I don't give 100%.   **TL;DR how do you silence your inner-regulator to try harder and do the impossible?**
Unilateral body weight exercises vs weighted exercises for general strength (Shoulders, core) Hello everyone :-)

I have searched this forum for any previous discussion around this topic and came across very interesting comments, which although helpful, were focused more around hangboarding (finger specific), rather than general strength (read: shoulders, core, etc.).

So specifically concerning general strength conditioning, I am looking for suggestions on training more difficult/unilateral body weight exercises versus adding more weights to bilateral/two-armed exercises.

For example:

* Weighted pulls ups vs one-armed pull ups
* Heavy pressing and/or rows vs difficult variations of body weight push ups (hand stand?) and rings

I am curious to learn what has your experience been cycling through these two different approaches? Which one gave you most benefits; i.e. did you notice any specific gains (or less injuries) when you switched from one protocol to other).

I am at a point where going heavier feels more strenuous on my shoulders and recovery times is starting to get longer. So, I am starting to consider more harder variations of bodyweight exercises (one-armed, difficult positions). But, I am not sure if I should continue having weighted exercises in the routine for maintenance; and if so then how frequent should it be.

For hangboarding in general, I plan to do a mix of of one-armed hangs &amp; max-hangs; max-hangs being for maintenance rather than adding any more weights now.

**A bit of my climbing/training history to add some perspective if that helps ..**

I am 37, climbing for 9 years, training consistently since 2014/15 and I climb at V9ish levels on most problems (*with a few 10s every now and then thrown in the mix*) that could be defined as fingery, technical, pockety, feet-on-body-tensiony climbs.

My shoulders feel week comparatively, but I am not sure anymore about that anymore, since I do relatively well on gastons, deep lock offs and shouldery moves. In general I am perceived as a weak climber who has to rely on specific micro-beta and specific positions to be able to send things.

My climbing to training ratio is 80-20 with hangboard and campus thrown in the 20%.

A few years back, I saw big jumps from V4 to V6/7 levels over a period of two years when I started doing weighted pulls and presses. I simply continued doing it for a couple more years - consistently and gradually going heavier - mostly with pull ups and dips.

As of now, I am at 50% of my bodyweight with weighted pull ups. Although pressing weight is lower, but bodyweight handstand push ups (against the wall) seems much harder than pressing heavier.

Thanks!
Trying to take a more data driven approach to progress tracking. Any other stats that you think would be interesting to see?
Self isolation training Right guys and gals. As we all know things are moving quick and I've just frozen my climbing pass so I want to create a training plan for the next month or two as I don't plan to leave the house much. I've got a beastmaker 2000 so I'm planning to possibly do three hangboard sessions a week, I have a patio where I can do some cardio (skipping) and I'd love to focus on a lot of core too. I'd love to know what a good climbing core workout would look like without any equipment except for a mat. Hit me!
Climbing gyms in my country closed due to Corona, how to stay strong with only a dumbbell? Hey all!

My country is going in full lockdown to the Corona virus, and unfortunately this means that all climbing gyms will close for at least a month.

Does anyone have some exercises to stay strong (fingers, chest, shoulders, core) with only a dumbbell and around 20kg of weights at my disposal? Unfortunately I can't install a pullup bar or my rings in my home since we are renting and no drilling or anything is allowed. For this reason I also don't own a beastmaker. I also own a 10kg weight vest but I suppose I can't do much with that without a pullup bar, other than maybe some squats and pushups.

To give ideas on where I am strenght wise: Upper body strenght is my strongest area. I project routes of around the 7A-7A+ range in my local climbing gym, with 2 7Bs the past few months that were very achievable yet at my limit. I can do about 2 pullups with 50KG added weight (at a bodyweight of 63 kg) and can hang on the half pads of the beastmaker for around 8-10 seconds with 25KG added weight.

Thanks in advance!
Tension Block Workout Ideas As with many, many gyms are closing and I am doing my best to self quarantine . That being said I don’t want to lose finger strength during this time.

I have a tension block and the Flash board. Does anyone have suggestions for workouts with these?

Context: I can hang the Flash board and have weights to hang from either one up to about 80 pounds (35kg)
Why does bouldering stress my (arm) tendons so much more than top roping? Anything I can do about it besides bouldering more? Been climbing for about 6 months now. Mostly top rope (2x/week) but try to boulder at least once a week as well. My arms usually feel pretty good while top roping but always feel like they're on the brink of injury while bouldering. Have always started slow, trying not to push myself too hard and listening to my body. But 6 months later this still seems to be a problem.

Anything I can do about it? Or just keep doing what I'm doing (i.e., progress slowly and listen to my body)?
Training using limited equipment during self-isolation/ lock down **This guide** is created so we can have a consolidated place for training ideas during limited access to gyms/ crags. It is not for those who have extended experience training from home, rather it is a general guide for those who have never had to &amp; is confused as to where to start. The post is structure such that you can pick out what you would like to improve on (weakness) or maintain (key performance factor for the season), it then gives you a list of options in terms of how to train this aspect using when you are likely to have at your disposal.

In terms of training volume, just make sure you are not going hard on the same muscle group/ connective tissue two days in a row. You want to rest as much as needed to feel fresh for the next set. Pay a lot of attention to how you feel waking up, any pain, soreness, discomfort or loss of RoM means you should back off. Please apply common sense when programming your own workouts, no one can tell you how much to rest. A hard training session for me might be barely a warm up for Ondra.

**Preface:** If you still have access to stores, it is wise to buy some timer, screws &amp; have some woodworking tools at hands so you can whip up simple structures/ gadgets to help you through what can potentially be a few months. If you have no idea how to do any of the exercises with good form, google it.

Essentials:

\- Patience

\- Creativity

\- Positive outlook

Good to haves:

\- Dumbbell (bonus for adjustable by plate)

\- Theraband (or other exercise bands)

\- Pull up bar

\- Hang board

\- Home wall (you are a lucky SoB)

**Training ideas (choose your own depending on your fitness level &amp; available equipment)**

**Upper Body Strength – Pull**

1. Pull up at various width (req: anything you can hang from, bar, house beam, door frame etc.)

* Alternative: Australian pull up with a broom stick between 2 chairs/ lying face down toe hooking a heavy furniture &amp; pulling on TheraBand’s
* Function: good for basic pulling strength
* How to perform: hang from the structure &amp; pull up (duh)
* Rec volume: 3-5 sets of 3-10 (if you can’t do 3, do negatives. If you can do 10 easily, add weight or choose another workout)

1. assisted one arm pull up (req: anything you can hang one arm from. Bonus points for a place to hang cord/ TheraBand)

* Function: good for one arm pulling strength
* How to perform: as per pull up but reduce the pulling power from one arm by hanging from 1-2 fingers or holding the assist cord/ TheraBand.
* Rec volume: 3-5 sets of 3-5 (if you can’t do 3, do negatives. If you can do 5 easily, reduce the opposite arm assistance further)

1. one arm pull up, typewriters &amp; other advanced variation (req: anything you can hang comfortably from)

* Function: pulling strength training for the strong
* How to perform: if you can do these you don’t need instructions
* Rec volume: if you can do these you don’t need instructions

**Upper Body Strength – Push**

1. Push up at various width (req: floor or any flat surface)

* Function: good for basic pushing strength, antagonist training
* How to perform: lie down on the floor with palm down at the correct width (depends on what you are doing) &amp; push up (duh)
* Rec volume: 3-5 sets of 3-10 (if you can’t do 3, do negatives. If you can do 10 easily, add weight or choose another workout)

1. Shoulder push up (req: floor or any flat surface)

* Function: good for front deltoid strength &amp; general shoulder strength, antagonist training
* How to perform: start in downward facing dog yoga position &amp; push up in closer to the direction of spine than to be perpendicular (bonus points for elevated feet)
* Rec volume: 3-5 sets of 3-10 (if you can’t do 3, do negatives. If you can do 10 easily, elevate feet or choose different exercise)

1. handstand push up (req: floor or any flat surface)

* Function: pushing/ shoulder strength training for the strong
* How to perform: if you can do these you don’t need instructions
* Rec volume: if you can do these you don’t need instructions

* Function: pushing/ shoulder/ core strength training for the strong
* How to perform: google
* Rec volume: if you can do these you don’t need instructions

**Upper Body Power – Pull &amp; Push**

Perform upper body strength exercises with speed (stay in control, I don’t want you going to snap city). If you have a home campus board, good on you but don’t flex at us gumbies.

**Forearm/ wrist general conditioning (** [Grip Strengthening Workout](https://youtu.be/YZEhcvilgsg) is a visual guide**)**

1. wrist curls &amp; reverse wrist curls (req: anything with a handle &amp; even weight distribution, broom, mop, dumbbell etc.)

* Function: general conditioning for the weak, scale it up to be forearm maintenance &amp; antagonist training for the strong
* How to perform: google

1. Wrist rotations – both directions (req: as above)

* Function: general conditioning for the weak, scale it up to be forearm maintenance &amp; antagonist training for the strong
* How to perform: Hold object at handle with weight away from fist, forearm parallel to ground. rotate with control from left to right.
* Rec volume: 3-5 sets of 10 (adjust weight or change where you grip the handles, the further down the tougher)

1. Hammer wrist curls (req: anything with a handle &amp; a weight on far side, broom, mop, one-side loaded dumbbell, chair etc.)

* Function: general conditioning for the weak, scale it up to be forearm maintenance &amp; antagonist training for the strong

Covid-19 Prep - Pull up bar? Hey folks. Coronavirus has closed most of the gyms in London. I was wondering if anyone could recommend me a pull-up bar for my small flat, as well as any other equipment which would help keep strength during periods of shutdown. Thanks!!!
Technique in bouldering: Outdoors vs Indoors Recently I sent my hardest grade outdoors (V7) and a highball (V5+) in the same session. Great day to say the least but I am perplexed... the problems I gravitate towards indoors are alot less techy and more powerful, I find that I do worse on problems that force a specific body position and offer less freedom of movement. That being said, I spend ALOT of time on powerful boulders outdoors and get shut down, but problems requiring alot of varying positions and longer problems in general I find are much more my style with both the problems I sent being that style. What is the cause of this? The techy problems indoors have very specific footholds and outdoors you have varying options, perhaps this is why? If my goal is to send harder outdoors, does this mean I should focus on power? What would you guys recommend? Thanks for reading :))
How can I half crimp? So I'll try to keep it short, I never half crimped and always used open hand whilst hangboarding. Is this bad? I can't use halfcrimp form, I try and I just switch to open hand. Should I learn to half crimp and if so how do I?
The basics of properly warming up off the wall Regardless of situation, a proper warmup before training or climbing is crucial to prevent injury and make sure you perform at your best. At it's core, a proper warmup involves sequentially:

1. raising your heart rate

2. increasing blood flow to working muscles

3. warming up joint synovial fluids

4. Actively working up to full range of motion in relevant areas.

In regards to climbing, it's important to promote blood flow and warmup the joints in and around the shoulders, biceps, elbows, forearms, wrists, and fingers. The hips and groin should be properly warmed up to achieve full range of motion. These goals can be met in as little as 5-10 minutes, or a more extensive warmup can last as long as 20-30 minutes depending on the individual. Creating a warmup routine takes trial and error over several months, and should be catered to your specific needs as a climber. Current times means many of us are training at home with minimal equipment, but simple exercises such as jumping jacks, arm circles, leg swings, etc. can be used as a basic warmup with zero equipment.

I'll use my current warmup routine as an example of achieving the goals above. My current warmup has been tweaked over 5-6 months to reach the point it's at now. I'm mostly a comp climber, but occasionally boulder outdoors. It's important to me that my warmup can be done anywhere regardless of equipment, and focuses on my shoulders as that tends to be the area that needs the most focus for me.

Currently, I do the following exercises in order:

1. 1 minute jumping jacks while opening/closing fists (raise heart rate, promote blood flow)

2. 1 minute shoulder dislocates and mobility circles with a Theraband (warmup joint fluid, work up to full range of motion)

3. 10-12 Standing Theraband IYT's (promote blood flow)

4. 30sec each: Zombie Walk/Leg Kick, Squat Sits, Wrist Circles (work up to full range of motion)

5. 5sec per finger pulley stretch (work up to full range of motion)

This routine takes about 5 minutes max, and only uses  one piece of equipment that can easily be fit in a gym bag. Some people chose to include more active finger warmups with rice buckets or portable hang boards, but warming up the fingers on the wall after a proper warmup for other areas is also viable.

Here is a basic list of exercises that can be done to achieve each warmup goal:

1. Raise your heart rate:

Jogging/Running,
Jumprope,
Jumping Jacks,
Rowing Machines,
Bicycling

2. Increase blood flow to working muscles:

Scapular Pulls,
Pushups,
Light Wrist Curls,
IYT's,
Facepulls,
Forearm Grip Trainers,
Pullups

3. Warming Up Joint Synovial Fluid:

(This is mostly achieved as a periphery benefit of the other three points)

4. Achieve Full Range of Motion:

Leg Swings,
Hip Circles,
Zombie Walks,
Lunges,
Shoulder Dislocates,
Wrist Circles,
Pulley/Finger Stretches,
Squat Sits

An important caveat: while it's tempting to create a very sophisticated warmup routine, the key is to make one simple and short enough that you will actually follow it. While a 30 minute warmup routine might be perfect in theory, in practice it may be hard to stick to it 3-4 times a week, especially on days where the psyche is high and you want to jump straight in. Create something short enough that you won't lose interest, but long enough to warmup properly. Any warmup is better than no warmup, so even a short 5 minute routine will achieve far more than jumping straight onto v0's and working your way up in difficulty.

I hope this post gives you some ideas for warming up (even at home) and helps you work towards an optimal warmup routine for you. Properly warming up can make a large difference in your climbing/training performance, and hitting these key points before jumping on the wall is vital to preventing injury. If anyone's interested, i'll consider making a post about on the wall climbing drills that can be done after your basic warmup that will continue the process and train relevant techniques in 10-20 minutes.
With all of my local gyms closing I had to get creative with how I train. I can't mount a hangboard in my apartment so I made a pinch block!
How should I train endurance for sport climbing? With this whole pandemic happening has anybody found a way to train any kind of endurance for sport climbing/long routes? I don’t have a crag nearby and would like to train somehow in my apartment.
You rent cardio/endurance, you don't buy it. Is it worth trying to maintain it during this? Endurance is something that requires ongoing high training/volume to maintain. It goes quick, and it comes quick. I can't help but think that it's a waste of training time to half ass try to keep endurance on a hangboard. There's a very low chance that we will be able to maintain it throughout the pandemic. No matter what, it'll take a bunch of sessions when the gyms open to get endurance back to normal. 

Do you guys think this a better time to focus on max strength on a hangboard first? If the gyms stay closed longer than 4-6 weeks, then maybe look at block periodization? 

Would love to hear some opinions on this.

Edit - I mean sport specific endurance for climbing. I plan on continuing generalized cardiovascular training with running and biking.
Waiting 4-6 weeks for the 2016 Moonboard holds or buying just the wood holds for the 2019 set which are currently in stock? Just built a Moonboard frame in my garage and placed an order for the 2016 hold set. I emailed them about current lead times and they told me to expect 4-6 weeks for another shipment to come in. I then asked about their wood holds sets for the 2019 board and they said that they were in stock and that I could place another order for those and they would cancel my first order. Do you guys think it would be worth it to have a 2019 Moonboard with just the wooden holds or should I wait for another month of no climbing to get the 2016 hold set? I've climbed on the 2016 set at my gym and really enjoyed it but I've never been able to try the 2019 set. There are a few factors that I'm already considering but I want some second opinions:

2016 Pros:

150 total holds for $150 less than just the 2019 wood holds

Over 30000 problems with a ton of benchmarks

From personal experience at my gym (which is now closed obviously), really good for training power and contact strength

2016 cons:

Have to wait more than another month before I can climb again (is this a big deal or should I just suck it up and hangboard for the time being)

I've heard the holds when brand new really tear up the skin

A lot of similar movement patterns for a lot of the problems

2019 wood only Pros:

Wood holds are great for the skin and great for training purposes since they require more concentration to not dry fire/cut feet

Can ship immediately

2019 wood only cons:

Only 379 problems for the wood only 2019 set (and no I don't have the budget to buy the wood holds now and wait for the 2016 holds to come back in stock) with very few benchmarks as well

Slightly more expensive for only 80 holds, almost half of the 2016 set

EDIT: I decided to stick with the 2016 hold set. As it turns out, they actually have the black holds in stock (yay!) so they're shipping those to me first while we wait for the yellow and white ones to arrive.
There Are No Coronavirus Training Rules Ok, so in very few cases to people ever tend to elect to not climb for several weeks and go right to training instead. There are no hard and fast rules to how often you should do "X".  Instead of misering over the details, which no one knows, here is an easy way to start figuring out what you can do and how much you should do.

Do you need to do a ton of crazy circuits you see Alex Puccio doing?!?!! NO!

Do you need to work every muscle from every angle??!!? NO!

What's the right protocol??!!? Guess and test, just like everyone else.

First [this Lattice guide](https://latticetraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Lite-Guide-to-home-adaptations.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3gL0ofOUeymI414PsZwbG7Xd3Tah8uKgb9b4sasnORhgeSMVl0JeKGAk0) is relevant for comparing just the targeted physical adaptations of various bouldering sessions.  You can break other types of sessions down any which way you want, but this is a decent starting point.

I will use myself as an example.  Before Corona I was doing the equivalent of:

* 1 board 10 (my day on a board every week)
* 1 strength intervals (my indoor volume day 1)
* 1 limit boulder (an outside or projecting day/days)
* 1 boulder intervals (outdoor volume or indoor day 2)

and off wall:

* Wide grip pullups
* Shoulder Press
* Wrist curls and wrist wrench
* 6/10 repeaters once every 7-10d
* 1/2 levers once a week
* Optional face pulls

This is not a perfect match at all, but it's a starting point.  So using this I should do:

* 2x max hangs (workout sub)
* 1x an cap hangs (workout sub)
* Max weighted wide grip pullups (workout sub)
* Something for power/velocity, preferably on a campus board (workout sub)
* Stabilizer work (broadly speaking)
* And whatever isn't covered that I was doing prior

I also have some additional bandwidth since there isn't the climbing load placed on my muscles. My focus before covid was shoulder stability/teres major/minor strength, power/big moves, and wrist stabilization/strength.  Really that just boils down to finger strength/capacity, some pulling and shoulder girdle strength, and basic wrist strength. Nothing really too fancy about it. No HIIT, no workout of the day. I can then try to add a few more movements to things, these movements to my final list are in bold below:

* 2x max hangs
* 1x an cap hangs (my former 6/10)
* Wide Grip Weighted Pullups
* Campus max moves workout from Crimpd
* 1 arm KB press (what I have at home, could do handstand press or whatever else is remotely similar)
* Face pulls 2x/week
* Wrist curls (both directions now) and wrist wrench
* 1/2 levers, increase volume by 1-2 reps
* Low ring rows (for shoulder stability)
* Since I can't climb I want to keep maintaining something similar to the big pogo and dynamic moves I was working on. I have a table on my porch so I will add some box jumps and maybe 2-3 sets of pistol squats to keep my legs firing.
* Pinch block hangs
* Ring IYT prone since I'm doing zero compression climbing and that is a style I was focusing on.

Wow, this is a big list, I will divide it by 4 days roughly grouping things together. Then I got and do that 1 week and note how I feel after each day. On week 2 I look at and assess any progress. If nothing moved then I give it until week 3. If things went down, then I do 10% less volume per movement.  If I progress each week, then next cycle I add volume or another movement.

**EDIT: Since it wasn't clear these are just sample workouts. They are not done 4 days in a row. I would have 1-2 rest days between them and just rotate through them in the general order listed below**

* Day 1: Max hangs, wide grip pulls, KB press, 1/2 levers, wrist curls
* Day 2: 6/10 Repeaters, ring low rows, reverse wrist curls, face pulls
* Day 3: Campus workout, box jumps/pistol squat complex, pinch block hangs
* Day 4: Max hangs 2, prone IYT, face pulls, maybe I feel add on another core movement.

What am I not doing? No supine IYT since I get that all from my pull work. No pushups as I have a push movement and some frontal plane movement. No weird crossfit style circuits because I'm eating less and going for runs and would rather save my recovery. No contrived pullups on various edges or workout challenges. Just bare bones shit. Fingers, pulling, some pushing, some core, repeat. Just as one would do while climbing.

What if you don't need finger strength? Work on maybe some aerobic capacity hangs or some anaerobic capacity hangs. Or, do the basics to maintain and up your pushing strength. We're all winging it here.

There you go. It's that easy. Just like in normal training you cannot always work everything. What you can do with your time is find a physical weakness and hammer it out with the extra headroom. Your technique is going to suffer unless you can climb, just get comfortable with that.  We know from the RCTM that people improve finger strength and forearm energy by doing mostly hangboarding for fairly long blocks. If you monitor your load right there is no reason why you shouldn't maintain and likely no reason why you can't improve a capacity.

If you're a beginner and haven't hangboarded, just search the sub for the many threads involving beginner hangboard routines and pick something else you can do- mobility, core work, overall cardio fitness, weight loss, whatever. There are no hard and fast guidelines just like normal training. There are no new whizbang workouts. Most of what you see is people throwing a ton of shit at a wall because they want to make this harder than it has to be.  Plenty of athletes do extensive cross-training for much of their off-season and yah, they can do drills, but they can dramatically improve physical capacities and body composition with a fairly simple set of movements.  Their coaches go through the same iterative process I am recommending here.

Hence forth and use the search feature!
Any advice on my home wall build? Hey everyone. With all the gyms being closed I’m looking to build a home wall so I figured I would follow this guide. 

https://www.instructables.com/id/Freestanding-Indoor-Rock-Climbing-Wall-For-150/

I have 2 sheets of 4x8 plywood sheets and 12 2x6 planks that I was going to use to roughly follow this guide but since I’ve never built a structure like this I wanted to see if there’s something I should do differently with my wall build. 

Let me know!

How to set up rings on a hangboard, when you don't have anything else to hang them Friend n°1 bruh  


EDIT : I was doing this for years when living in a flat, but yeah, this isn't my setup at the moment (of course there's a beam just next to it, and also a T-nuts w/ bolt on the back of the board), I just did a picture to explain the idea to people who are in quarantine without any place to hang a TRX, and thought sharing it here.

Relatively new to climbing - hangboard to train during virus? I got into bouldering \~2-3 months before the virus and fell in love with the sport. Prior to our gym closing, my girlfriend and I were climbing 3-4 times each week and also doing bodyweight exercises/core. Now that I haven't been able to climb I'm going a bit crazy feeling like my gains are being lost. For what it's worth, I'm currently climbing V4-V5 indoors. 

My question is - for a relative newcomer to the sport (less than 6 months of climbing), would it be too dangerous to get a hangboard and start doing very light sessions 1 or at most 2 times each week? I understand that typically people strongly advise against this type of off the wall training before 1-1.5 years of climbing, but I am wondering if it would be possible if not done *in addition to* on the wall climbing.

 FWIW, I also happen to be a high level cyclist, so I am already inclined towards structured &amp; periodized training and know that I eventually want to bring this structure to my climbing training, just not sure if this is too early.
Easy DIY Homemade Pinch Block (2x4 and cord) If your stuck at home and want a simple project to make a pinch block, find a small piece of 2x4 and drill two holes in it nearly center or slightly offset. You can then use it to train wide and narrow pinches. Sanding the wood a little bit with &lt;100 grit sandpaper helps improve the texture a bit. You can hang anything off this (kettlebells, dumbells, plates, a canvas bag with water bottles in it).

Should you bulk when training for climbing? Now that most of us just train for climbing, and I guess trying to become stronger. What do you eat? What is your calories and protein goal for the day? 

I am just asking because I am not so sure about what should I do.

Up until now i tryed to not cross the 2500 cal a day but still get about 120 gram of protein. I weight about 70-71 kg and my hight is 185 cm.

edit: the question I am trying to ask is the following, is it possible to get stronger while eating "only" 2500 cal a day?
5 months of max hangs, visualized [Here's the chart](https://imgur.com/Knja3cO)

**TL;DR:** ***around 60 max hang sessions over approximately 5 months. Went from +25lb added (115% body weight) to +52.5lb (133% body weight) with proper form for 6x10 second sets on a 15mm, slippery wooden training edge. Max hangs are hard, frustrating, and a lot of 1 step forward, 1 step back, but it PAYS OFF.***

So back in September, our climbing season ended early. I had been working on my first 5.13b all season, although I'd gotten a finger pulley injury in May. I had been falling at the first crux of the route ... 40+ times. Then, on the final weekend of the season, I made it through the first crux, then the second, falling at the LAST hard move before the thank god jug.

Then it snowed, and that was it.

So I decided, fuck it, I need to fucking change something. Fuck.

[And I watched this classic piece of Dave Macleod magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKE5VH5-qg)

I was particularly stunned when he said that one season, he just did max hangs 6 days a week for 6 months and went from 8b to 8c+ or some insanity. I was like... well I can do that. And so I did.

My training edge is 15mm wood, with +2mm rounding for a total of approximately 17mm-ish. It's one of Sonnie Trotter's old VICE hangboards he gave me a few years back.

When I started, I was barely able to do my full 6 x 10 second hangs with 25lb added. And what's worse, my form was utter shite. I couldn't hang straight arm with that much weight, and would arch my back or pull up. Weak ass shoulders are a thing.

**I set myself goal of +50lb added weight for 6x10second hangs.**

I decided to make a plan to do as many days of hanging as possible, and cut back on regular bouldering. Slowly, week by week, I was starting to see small progress. I was adding around 2.5lb per week, and quickly seeing gains. I arrived at around 37.5lb added without too much trouble, but things started getting pretty tough around 40lb.

It was common for me to fail to do the full 10 sec x 6, often failing out on the 4-6th set at 6-7 seconds.

I also suck at cutting back on regular climbing, so I ended up getting a mild DIP joint strain injury around December, due to pushing too hard, which killed about a month for me.

Fortunately I came back strong in late January, and was able to quickly ramp back up to the high 40's.

**Then, last week... the impossible happened. I did the full 50lb x 6 x 10 second set without failure, and today did 52.5lb x 6 x 10 without failure.... AND WITH PROPER FORM.**

Anyways. I hope this inspires you guys to commit to the long haul.
For those looking to buy a hangboard and having trouble finding one available - Beastmaker themselves are still producing and shipping boards worldwide. After shipping, the Beastmaker 1000 is currently selling for 90eur (111usd) As someone who desperately wanted to start a hangboarding routine during these times of isolation, I was having a hell of a time finding anything online - almost all retailers are sold out. However, it looks like Beastmaker is still keeping it up as long as they can. Hope this is helpful!
Working the moves on sport routes Hi all


Im a boulderer turned sport climber with not that much red pointing experience. I was wondering if any experienced sport climbers were willing to give some insight into how to properly work moves on a rope.


So imagine you get to a boulder problem crux on a route you're working. Do you generally bring up a clipstick and work it out essentially on top rope? Do you just dog the route and try and "ground up" the boulder problem from the last bolt? 


A lot of routes near me start vertical and then turn into short a roof which generally contains the crux. So when working this, if I were to clipstick out into the roof, every time I fall off I'll swing into space and have to jug up the rope to get back on which sucks for you and your belayer. But on harder routes a lot of these boulders can be like 7C&lt; already so this process can be like 3 sessions worth of falling like this which just doesn't seem right? And bolt to bolting and then working the moves on the way down with the anchor clipped (what I unusually would do on less steep or easier routes) doesn't work because trying to "ground up" a 7C boulder without feeling the holds etc just takes so long.  


Tldr; how do you work a crux in a roof when there are no bolts near the moves you're falling on and while working it out you're staying on for 1 or 0 moves at a time?


I hope this is reads okay, words aren't really my thing.


Thanks
How did you get your first finger injury? I couldn't find this kind of information readily available, only lots of anecdotal advice, so lets collect some unscientific data! We are talking about internal finger injuries severe enough that you didn't recover from them within days and they constrained your climbing in some way. Obviously only climbing related injuries count. There is plenty of good data on how many are injured so no need to answer if you have never been injured. 

Bonus question, include in the comments how many minutes into the session you were when the injury occurred.

Daily stretch routine Flexibility has been starting to limit my climbing ability. So I am looking for a daily stretch routine to hammer in while quarantined. Looking for a full body routine that last &lt;10 minutes. Any plans/schedules you guys follow?
AMA #3 Neuroscience of Training and neuroathletic considerations for climbing sports Hello climbers and  boulderers,

&amp;#x200B;

since we are all pretty much locked down and have no opportunities to get training as much as we would like maybe there is some time to think about the theory of training and climbing/bouldering. Therefore I decided to do a 3rd AMA to have discussions with you about several topics.

My expertise is in functional neurology as a fundamental theoretical basis for training and climbing as a sport. You can find the previous AMA's  [here (AMA#1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/f16kaq/ama_2_neuroscience_of_training/), [and here (AMA#2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/e9mog2/ama_neuroscientist_athletic_trainer_with_a/).

I am looking forward to some interesting discussions with you, shoot me anything you would like to know.
What are your new maxes/metrics? A discussion: I just wanted to start a thread where people can post their most recent max's, training/mental/climbing/life "wins", ask questions of each other, after reading the aforementioned info, and just generally spitball about how to stay psyched, fit, and happy during this time.
How do I actually train for climbing? Especially now that im stuck home for quarantine. So I've been climbing for about 8 months now and I climb around V4/V5 but I've never actually had proper training or anything aside from watching a couple videos when I first started. Now that im stuck home all day I want to actually start a training schedule that I can from home so I'll be ready and stronger than ever when I actually get back to the gym. Overall I basically need to work on everything but I truly dont know which exercises would be the most beneficial for me. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Strength between grip types I've been climbing with various levels of training and commitment for the past four years, but decided to start really hangboarding during this quarantine. When assessing where I was at with my max hangs, I was shocked by the difference in strength between my half crimp and my three finger drag.   


Using half crimp on a \~18mm rail, I can hang at 140%  body weight (+60lbs) for ten seconds.

Using a three finger drag on the same rail, I can only hang about 107% body weight (+10lbs) for ten seconds.   


I know that the three finger drag is a weak point for many climbers, but I didn't think the difference in strength would be so large. Is this your experience as well? What kind of strength differential do you see between grip types? Should I be focused on closing the strength gap between these grip types? I'm curious to hear from people who train in a more dedicated manner than myself.   


Thanks!
Massive Newbie Hangboarding Gains Due To Not Climbing I've never been much to stick with a hangboarding regimen for more than a month or two, seemed as though adding it to my routine never stuck, or I would get some sort of injury and the first thing to remove from the routine was hangboarding. 

Now that I have been stuck at home for a month Ive been doing it religiously 2x a week. Ive gone from barely being able to hang on the medium edge for 7 seconds to doing it for 20 seconds with 15lbs added on. I never seen gains like that while also climbing - is this due to an inability to recover ( in my 40s ) ? 

Also my fingers hurt a lot less from not climbing 4x a week.
Thinking of a garage woody. Is a 8 ft wide 10 ft tall wall at 50 degree with a 1 foot kicker worth? Thoughts and recommendations....
Too much torso/shoulder engagement? (Lattice Training - common hangboarding mistakes) Just want to discuss this new video by Lattice Training. As some background I've been climbing for 3.5 years training for about 20 months off and on. I used to do repeaters from the RCTM but now I'm 2 weeks into max hangs as per T4C.

Link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRMqKnQyfZE&amp;feature=emb\_rel\_end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRMqKnQyfZE&amp;feature=emb_rel_end)

**First**: the main thing that surprised me in the video was how over-engagement of the shoulders (semi front-lever type body positioning) can be problematic because it's "very hard to work maximally on the fingers when you're putting so much stress and strain into the rest of your torso," and it's "quite the strain on the lower back," just to quote exactly.

I found that when I started doing max hangs, the only way I could hang on the 8mm edge for enough time on the rock prodigy board (with little or no weight added) was to highly engage my torso like this. I could tell that it was my fingers failing, not my shoulders. Although, when doing heavier max hangs on 20mm, I don't find the need to engage my torso like this, and I engage my shoulders more like the position Tom recommends. It seems like adding weight to the strenuous position may be the main concern. Also, I chose these two holds on my board since they would carry over to other boards at the gym more easily; I know it's recommended to use 14-20 mm for max hangs this board is a bit odd. Any advice/experience relating to this?

**Second** (kind of relating to the video): my hands naturally go to an open crimp even on 8mm (may suggest my half crimp grip is relatively weak?). Does anyone relate? I do plan on forcing the crimp position into my training now that I know I haven't even been using it (I got someone to take photos during a hang, haha!).

As I said, I just started this type of hangboard training, so I'm learning and trying to create good habits, not bad. Let me know your thoughts and experiences! Thanks and take care.
Who are the world class climbers who got to that level the fastest? Hi guys, I was curious if anyone happens to know who the pro climbers are that got to that level fastest. It seems like pro climbers start at older ages than pro tennis players or pro baseball players or other sports. So does it just take less time to be a world class climber for some reason? How long is the fastest? 

The only one I know of personally is Anna Davey in Australia who I think started in her mid 20s and now climbs for a living, though idk what grades or if it’s truly world class grade wise for her. Does anyone come to mind for you all?
Keep yourself busy during quarantine - I made a fingerboard training app Hi there,

during lockdown I decided to create my own hangboard / fingerboard app, as the ones I used did not satisfy my needs. E.g. pausing by just taping on the screen or get credit even for half assed workouts :D.

Here are the main features:

• customizable Interval Timer  
• timer visualization as animated background  
• workout logging  
• save your favorite workouts  
• add notes to and edit your workouts  
• choose between 300, 500 and 700 Hz beep sounds  
• climbing grade converter

I hope you also have some benefits from this!!! If you give it a try and give me any feedback or suggestions, I'll really appreciate it :)

Techniques to calm down before your sending-attempt? As soon as i know I'm close to send a long term redpointing project i feel super nervous before I start climbing. This results in high heart rate, overgripping, and shaky and bad foot placement. I'm curious -has anyone developed techniques to deal with that? Best!
As a younger climber, what workouts should be avoided for safety? I've heard a lot about how hangboarding/fingerboarding is dangerous for teenage climbers, as their tendons are still developing.

Does this mean all hangboarding should be avoided?  Are there other, safer, alternative workouts?

I'm lucky to have a phenomenal home wall, but I still want to add in supplemental strength training as my improvement slows down.

Just some reference for the difficulty I'm at: I'm 15, current best outdoors is v4 (I have done three, but one was soft as hell, and another is an FA), and have been able to send almost every v4-6 at my gym back when they were open.  I can do 8 pullups and have been climbing somewhat seriously since August.
3 Finger Crimp Training https://www.instagram.com/p/B-ytTDjjkQf/?igshid=jxidt9o7vxo0

Was scrolling through Neil Gresham’s insta and saw this. What do yall think? Does anybody have any experience training front 3 and back 3 half crimps? Does it translate well to climbing or 4 finger hangboarding improvement? I am currently going through a small repeater phase where I incorporate a few sets of front and back three and was wanting to get any info on it.
How Do You Know When to Rest? I've been going to a years-long project of mine pretty much every day (mostly) for the last two weeks and it got me thinking about resting. I realized I don't really have a good feel for when it's time to take a day or two off (or three). Furthermore, when you DO feel way too wrecked to actually stick the move or do the boulder, does it still make sense to go out the next day and try it? More simply put, does trying a boulder/move while you're wrecked actually add to your training (assuming you'll rest afterward), or is it more or less pointless?

Mostly asking you sports-science peeps on this sub..
A small hack to use both sides of a Tension Flash Board I'm currently using both sides of the flash board for one-armed in the center and two-armed hangs on the other side because I'm not terribly strong and that feels most stable for me. 

I got sick of having the board rotate under me or having to keep adjusting the rope, but I found a low-effort way to adjust less rope that works almost as well. 

By placing carabiners in the two loops on either side, you can get a positive angle on the other side. The positive amount it gives might be too much for people stronger than me, but I'm quite happy with it.

Overcoming mental game of climbing overhangs Hey people!

I have trouble pushing myself in overhanging climbs, despite knowing they are overall safer than face climbs. 

I find the moves in an over hang a lot more committing somehow, which is where I am struggling. I also struggle with the clips, even when I am clipping from a jug which I could probably hold for a long time.

Any one got some specific overhang mental tips that could help? 

My question relates specifically to an outdoor sport climb, the route in question has some run outs but not that would be a show stopper for me on a face climb. 
I think that my problem stems from trusting myself to keep holding on with a pump and committing to bigger moves on the overhang. 

Thank you for anyones personal experience!
Sharing some hangboard training routines for every level ^(English is not my first language, excuse me for any typos or mistakes. If you find any -and you will-, tell me so I can edit it. I hope you find this useful for you.)

Since many of us are here trapped at our homes, without access to a climbing gym or our crags, I'm sharing with you some routines that can be done on hangboards that will make you suffer, cry, and hate this devil's invention. You will ask for mercy but many of you will also understand that hangboard training is also one of the most specific tools we have to train our physical condition for climbing and that it is pretty useful not only right now, during the confinement, but also during the climbing season.

**If you want to go straight to the routines, tables are at the very bottom.**

You don't need a huge grade for using these workouts, but note that on the lower grades, the limiting factor is mostly technical and mental rather than physical. Your training should always pay special attention your weak points but right now, during this lockdown our resources are limited and many of us only count with a hangboard.

Keep in mind that hangboarding is not the definitive and ultimate way to push up your grade because every hangboard routine is always repetitive and lacks technical and problem solving aspects that are very important for climbing performance. In the end, the best way to train climbing movements is climbing and climbing, and there aren't any shortcuts for that. However, hangboarding is a pretty effective way to train power-endurance and endurance of your upper body.

These workouts are an effective way to train flexor muscles of forearms and muscles involved on the elbow flexion (biceps brachii, anterior brachii and long supinator), and shoulder extensors ("retropulsors" latissimus dorsi, teres major, deltoid (especially the posterior beam), and long triceps), not to mention the pectoralis major, whose action is very important for the shoulder joint from a position of maximum "antepulsion" (basically, hanging with the arms stretched out from a bar).

There are so many different workouts you can do on a hangboard, but with these workouts you may be able to develop your own routines. Please note, you should not always use the same routine or eventually you will get to a plateau. You should consider certain signs or parameters to keep evolving into harder routines.

# How do these routines work?

These routines are based on "**contracts**". Each contract is one minute. That's the time you have to do one or two exercises and to rest until the next contract starts at the next minute.

So you have one minute to do one or two exercises and you can rest during the remaining time you didn't used. At the next minute you will have another set of exercises and another minute to complete them and rest. Check the tables and you will understand it easily.

If you have to do more than one exercise on the same contract, you have to do them consecutively, and you can only rest after finishing both of them, until the next minute and contract starts.

For most people, one round is 10 - 15 minutes and most people do one or two rounds.

**Don't forget to warm up your fingers.**

# What do I need?

* A hangboard. Obviously. You have to identify its different holds before starting the routine so you know exactly which holds are you going to use. These routines are planed for a pretty much standard hangboard that counts with jugs, slopers, pinches and crimps, but it can be adapted to your own. A jug can be exchanged with a pull-up bar. As an example, in my personal case, I don't count with slopers on my hangboard, and as my usual crags don't have many slopers I don't really care about them, so I changed slopers for two finger pockets.About the holds:
   * Small, medium and big crimps (aprox: 1.5 cm, 2.5 cm and 3.5 cm). You wont need the small one on the easiest level. Always use open crimp or switch to a bigger edge. Avoid half and closed crimps on this particular routines. Why not half crimp on this case? Well, [here's my answer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/g69ian/sharing_some_hangboard_training_routines_for/foa6rb5/)
   * Slopers: *Sloper1* is a better hold than *Sloper2*
* A crono or timer. Specifically an interval timer or programmable one, like the ones used for HIIT training. I use this [android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deslomator.complextimer&amp;hl=es) and it's perfect for this (It doesn't has an English version yet -only Spanish- but it's pretty easy to use). There are similar websites, but I haven't seen anything as complete at that app. [Example.](https://fitlb.com/tabata-timer)
* Notebook: (Recommended) to keep track of your training to measure your progress.

# How to plan this routines?

Ideally you could train for three weeks with your routine, then rest for one week, and repeat the workout for another week before considering to introduce substancial changes on the routine.

Depending on your level, you could do this workout twice or three times per week. Right now, during this lockdown, if you can't go climbing you could push it up to once each two days would be, but be careful. Do not get injured.

Depending on your level you can do one round, or two rounds, with a long rest between them (15 minutes or so)

# How to choose my level?

For trying for the first time, each routine has an ORIENTATIVE level considering your (outdoor) grade. However, as said before, grade depends on many different factors that can't be measured on a hangboard.  You can also check the total amount of pull ups each routine has. Also, each hardboard is different and same workout will feel different on different hangboards. (For example, I have climbed 7c, but I couldn't do the level 4 (that's a shit ton of pull ups for me!) so I'm on level 3).So in order to perfectly identify your level you have to:

* Be able to complete all contracts in time on your first round (if you do it more than one rounds). If you can complete the first round but you struggle during the second, that's a nice nivel. If you can't do the second round, just do one round. That's fine too.
* **Moving up to the next level:** If you can stay for more than one minute on the last contract (see the tables) that level could be too easy for you so you should add another round. If on the second round you stay for longer than a minute again on the last contract, then it's time to move to the next level routine or to add a third round.
* Some ideas for a more personalised **routine:**
   * Add or quit one pull up at each contract in which you have to do pull-ups.
   * Use smaller/bigger holds
   * If you are on the lower levels and at some point you struggle with pull-ups, don't worry, try to do negative pull ups or use an elastic band to assist them.
   * I would not recommend: Add or quit rest time. Add extra weight.
   * Check more ideas [here](https://www.metoliusclimbing.com/training_guide_10_min.html).

**IMPORTANT:** The point is to stick to the same routine during a planned period. Do not improvise. This way you will be able to track your progress. We climbers are like Spartans, but you have to be honest with yourself and don't plan a routine that is to hard for you. Train smart is way better than just train hard.

# Glossary

* Pull-Ups: I guess this doesn't need any explanation.
* Hang: Hanging with straight arms. ^(Not so straight, you always need to use correct technique, see photo below.)
* 140º Hang: Hanging with arms flexed at 140º. [Like This](https://i.imgur.com/lK8MELX.jpg).
* 90º Hang: Hanging with arms flexed at 90º (right angle at the elbow). [Like this](https://i.imgur.com/GmTibmi.jpg).
* Top Hang: Hanging with arms completely flexed (So your hands should be at the same height as your shoulders, like holding a pull up at the top). [Like this](https://i.imgur.com/kr6RPZh.jpg?2).
* Last hang: This is always the last contract. It is like the previous "Top Hang". In this case you have to hold the position as long as posible. When you can't hold it any longer you will go down as slowly as posible. When you get down you should write down how much time did you lasted there.
* Hang until 45'': You will only find this on the higher levels and you will hate it. It means that after the exercises of certain contract you will hang on a certain hold until second 45 of the contract so you will only get a 15 seconds rest before the next contract.

Does anyone have a mobility routine they want to share? It's the only thing in my program that I feel meh about.  Anyone has something they've been doing for a while and/or really like it?
Jordan Canon and Mark Hudon posted a multi-pitch efficiency workshop on Instagram today. It'll be available for (a little less than) 24 hours. I know multi-pitch isn't really the focus of this sub, but if that's the type of climbing you train for then you might learn something useful in the workshop. Mark Hudon is an absolute climbing legend and a treasure trove of knowledge.

Edit: https://www.instagram.com/cannonjtc/
How much does warm up prevent injuries? Almost any study on the topic concludes that strength training reduces injuries by a good margin. Also plenty of studies conclude that neuromuscular training reduces injuries, but not as much as strength training does.

There are lots of anecdotal evidence that warm up reduces injuries. Doing an exercise with "cold" muscles just feels like you are asking for an injury. Also studies seem to conclusively indicate warm up improves consequent maximum performance.

However, almost half of all studies on warm up reducing injuries find no measurable effect. And those that do, had mainly cardio athletes do some form of strength (or neuromuscular) training as the warm up routine, where the control group just skipped it. Which makes me wonder was the the added strength/neuromuscular training that actually caused the injury reduction rather than the warm up effect. It seems so simple the separate the two possibilities by having the control group perform the same "warm up" just at another time, such as after the workout instead of prior to it. But I have been unable to find such a study.

Its sort of frustrating because almost everyone praise and insist on warm up and I hate going against the prevailing opinion as there is a high risk I am the one making the mistake. Yet the evidence is somewhere between non existent and very weak. Warm up also takes up quite a lot of time and in some ways restricts possible workouts (since you cant split up workout without doing additional warm ups). Here are two meta studies on the topic.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25694615](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25694615)

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK72912/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK72912/)

My bottom line for now, literally, don't take it for granted warm up reduces injuries.
No psyche Surely I cannot be the only one, but I am feeling a considerable lack of Psyche recently. Most definitely related to a deficiency in climbing over the last six weeks.

What to train to send? I am working on a 15m, 15 degree overhung 8a (soft undoubtedly, but first of the grade for me). The climb is basically small holds , with no good rest. 

I can do all the moves but cannot link the two cruxes so I am perpetually 2-hanging the climb because there's no good rest so I power out between hard moves.

I think my issue is lack of power endurance...?

How should I train so that I can link the moves and send? 

Practice 20 move problems on circuit board? Hangboard at max 80%?
How common is it for hands not to sweat? What the title says, my hands don't or can't sweat. 

I didn't realise this until I started climbing and was able to compare with how much chalk  people were using -and why they were using it. I was wondering if any other people experience this or how common it is? It probably plays to my advantage  but it's possible it might disadvantage me in some way. I've yet to meet another person who experiences this.
Training deficiency from mainly climbing outdoors Up until now I have mainly focused on training lead climbing indoors. During climbing season I climbed on real rock maybe once every other week. However, this year I am going to spend my summer in a location with a lot of crags and I am therefore planning to mainly climb outdoors over an extended period (3-4 months).

I have repeatedly heard that only climbing outdoors does not have the same training effect as climbing indoors has. Is this true? If so, what skills or strength will I most likely lose and how can I best make up for it? Will I be a lot weaker when I return to the gym?

Quarantine training works! I'm writing this post to share some experience and to help climbers that are still in lock down to be motivated to train.

In my country we can climb now and this weekend was my first climbing experience since a 2 month break. In this period i was training a lot and tried to focus on my weaknesses which are flexibility, core and finger strength to some point. I was stretching 5-6 days a week, doing core training 2-3 times a week with a focus on a stabilization and used the hangboard every other day, doing max hangs. I made visible improvement in flexibility although i didn't measured anything, my core got a stronger and i was able to do 2-3 reps more on every exercises i did and i added 7 kgs on the hangs. 

What happened was amazing! I onsighted a 7a and my hardest onsight before was 6b+ and i sent my hardest route to date a 7b+ on my second go and I wasn't even pumped even if I didn't train any endurance prior to this. My other hardest ascents (7bs) took me on average 2 days do complete.  I went on the trip with expectations to feel bad and don't climb well but this wasn't the case. I didn't feel really good on the rock and my feeling for the moves wasn't really there but it quickly came but i was feeling super solid on the rock probably because of the core training and i was able to step higher and keep my hips closer to the wall which allowed me to climb much more efficiently and this is probably the reason i did so well on the trip.  Also i was much more comfortable holding small holds. 

Guys just believe that you can improve even if not climbing and you will for sure! Good luck.
Another Quarantine Training Success Story: Broke my 3+ year plateau! Happy to announce my quarantine training has helped me break through my 3+ year plateau!

Have to admit, i have never been big on training.  I just never felt like i had time to build a program and stick with it.  I casually tried the Rock Climbers Training Manual, but it just didnt work for me because I like to get outside as much as possible and i kept breaking my schedule and having to start over.  I just assumed that was the training bible and didnt do much research after that.

I took the month of January and some of february off from climbing, and I started lifting weights again for the first time in 10 years. I was following Wendler's 5-3-1 powerlifting program. When i was ready to start climbing again, i took it slow.  it's around this time i learned of Bechtel's nonlinear periodization training, and instantly i knew this would be the program for me.  I have combined my 5-3-1 program with the Bechtel program, as the Bechtel program does suggest powerlifting for strength.  been doing this since the beginning of March. (would be happy to share all the intimate details here if anyone is interested).

So i sent my first 5.12b in late 2015, and my first v7 in 2017. since then i have done several more 5.12bs and v7s, but no 5.12c's or V8's.  Two weeks ago, i was able to get out with my housemate and send my first 5.12c! a project from last season that went really fast in one day.  Over this last weekend, i was able to put down my first v8 on saturday (another of last seasons projects), and another 12c yesterday (third go, so pretty suprising)!

Stick with it guys! It's working! Thanks for all of your help along the way, this sub is invaluable!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Alright let me explain

* First I would recommend reading the Wendler 5-3-1 book. it takes about 3 hours. dude is an absolute meathead, but his knowledge about strength training is amazing.  You can find summaries of the program all over the web though.  I like it because it is uncomplicated and easy to adjust it to suit a climber's workout.
   * The idea is rotate out the four main power-lifts: military press, squat, bench, and deadlift.  The program provides you with the specifics about reps and weight, but essentially the idea is low reps and slow gains over a long period.  you supplement these lifts with accessory exercises on lift days (this is where you alter it to be more climber specific), and conditioning on off days.  
* Second, I would recommend your read Steve Bechtel's nonlinear periodization protocol. It's contained in his book "climb strong", which you can also read in 5-6 hours.  the idea behind this type of training is important, as well as the idea behind 3-6-9 ladders. good summary of this stuff [here](https://strengthclimbing.com/steve-bechtels-3-6-9-ladders/).
   * the idea behind nonlinear periodization is not too different from the RCTM.  It takes the same concept, but where a RCTM program takes a minimum of say 8-12 weeks, the nonlinear periodization breaks it down into 4 week cycles (or less).  I'm currently doing the easiest version of the training which is basically about a week and a half cycle. 
   * Bechtel breaks the cycle down into: intensive endurance, power endurance, Limit bouldering, and strength.  his philosophy is also that actual climbing (aka bouldering) is the best training you can do, so never replace a bouldering session with a campus or hangboarding session. the other part of this philosophy is that if you are getting outside a lot, you have to treat your outdoor sessions like a day of training as well. this way, getting outside does not break your cycle.  I'll break down my main workout in each category:
      * intensive endurance: 7 minute hangboard minus 50 lbs on a pulley system - cycle holds for 1 minute, then shake out for one minute, repeat until the 7 minutes is up. 3 sets, 15 minutes rest between sets.

1. before the pulley system, i just had my feet in a chair. this works perfectly well, just hard to quantify progress
2. I also started at 5 minutes and worked my way up to 7 minutes.
3. Bechtel talks a bit about this protocol in other material, where he recommends doing 4 minute reps, 30 seconds cycling and 30 seconds shaking out.  I'll try this next cycle, i just didnt know about it at the time.

* power endurance:  I'm lucky enough to have a moonboard in my garage. for this i have been doing pyramids, rhythm intervals, etc. basically the exercises that gets you rapid firing problems for set time limits and set grades.  the other type I do is traversing jugs for 15 moves, then trying to fire a boulder problem around my onsight or slightly above. I mix this up a lot, so just follow the individual exercises.
* limit bouldering: like it sounds, just trying to climb hard stuff i cant climb. Bechtel's book gives you details on how to structure these sessions, but it is essentially just try hard things you can't do for a session.
* Strength: these are the days i lift and hangboard.  Bechtel explains the benefits of doing this on the same day, but honestly the time saving aspect is the most attractive thing for me.  basically you choose the 3 hold types you want to train (should be the same for a full cycle) and follow the 3-6-9 hangboarding routine, the 5-3-1 lifting routine, and some mobility exercises in a cycle. one set might look like this:

1. 3-6-9 on 22 mm +15 lbs 
2. deadlift 115 lbs 3 times
3. doorway stretch
4. rest until 3 minutes after first 3-6-9 rep
5. repeat for 3 sets

Next cycle

1. 3-6-9 on 15 mm - 3 finger drag
2. push up cycle
3. shoulder mobility exercise
4. rest until 3 minutes after first 3-6-9 rep
5. repeat for 3 sets

etc. etc.

* So if you do climb outside a lot, you can see how you need to treat your outdoor days like your training days. 
   * set yourself up a week in advance so that your endurance day lines up with the day your are going to a steep crag. or make it to where your limit bouldering day lines up with a day you plan to project some blocs. do them back to back like i did this weekend (limit boulder day was saturday, intensive endurance was sunday. this back to back combo is great because they use such different muscle groups and doesnt tax the fingers).
   * then when you get out there, think of it with training in mind.  dont just give a red point burn or two and crack a beer.  think of a pumpy climb as a set of intensive endurance. you gotta do at least 3! how do you cool down inside? 
* my week might look like this:

1. monday: strength and hangboard (1 mile run)
2. tuesday: power endurance
3. wednesday: rest (20 min. stationary bike)
4. thursday: limit bouldering
5. friday: rest (1 mile run)
6. saturday: day at pumpy crag. rp burn then 3 laps on pumpy 5.11
7. sunday: day at shorter, power crag. 5 rp burns on power endurance line
8. monday: rest
9. Tuesday: strength
10. etc. etc.

Some notes: you HAVE to keep a workout journal for this to work. that was another issue i had: i couldnt build a proper program because i just didnt want to keep up with a journal (leading to a lot of unstructured and unproductive "training").  

Another thing is I am focusing way more on general fitness.  I realize now that I, personally, cannot get any better at this point without working my whole body.  so i am counting calories and macros, eating a ton more protein, running hills and short distances on my off days. been doing very strenuous youtube ab workouts (madfit 20 min total core stuff is my favorite) about once a week on days i feel my workload was light. basically acting as best i can like an athlete.  I think this could just be working well on my confidence and subconscious as well, but I'll take it.

Hope this helps anyone. if there is anything i can make more clear, please let me know.  I owe this sub a lot to my recent success!
Hangboard routine breakdown from the latest Hooper's Beta video. Highly recommend checking out the video and/or show notes to fully understand this routine. Based on lots of research and practical testing. Again -- there is no BEST hangboard routine.
Do we put too much time into core? I feel like so many climbers are smashing out core workouts non-stop since lockdown began. I am all for the little and lots approach; a few simple exercises with progressive overload seems fine, but I feel 1hr core workouts are a little over the top.

I've never found that my core was too weak for anything, only that I've failed to engage it properly: but that's a technique issue really.

Are people over-thinking core, or should I be doing more?
BoardCat: a new app for home walls. (Looking for testers and feedback!) Hi folks,

I'm posting because I built a new little app for logging problems on my home wall, and I am wondering if anyone else would like to try it out.

Like many others, I recently built a quarantine wall. While I'm a big fan of the existing commercial board layouts (Moon, Tension, Kilter), I didn't have room in my space for a full 8'x12' board. So I built my wall with a mix of holds, and started to look for a way to track the problems that I was setting.

I did a bunch of searching and tried out the existing apps -- Stokt, OpenClimb, Spray, etc -- but none of them fit my needs. The biggest limitation of these apps is that they work by having you take a photo of your *entire board,* and then overlaying a highlight for the holds you select as part of a problem. This means that if you decide to change any of the holds on your board, you'll need to take an entirely new photo, and potentially lose all of the problems that you've created!

So I decided to create an app that would work a bit differently. Instead of taking a photo of your entire board, you upload photos of your individual holds. Then, you "set" your holds on the board dynamically, so that you can change them later without having to reset the entire board. This lets you do some pretty cool things... like seeing "which problems do I use this hold in?" and "which holds on my systems board are the least-frequently used?"

As of right now, I've just been working on the app in my spare time. (Which I have an abundance of, due to quarantine...)

But I'm curious to see: would other folks with systems boards find this app useful? Does anyone want to beta test and provide some feedback?

https://preview.redd.it/i5yzon4e6dy41.png?width=2876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96f22c3e018486c300f6c0215a86d5706dce539f

&amp;#x200B;

**UPDATE: If you would like to test the app, please send me an email at** [**info@boardc.at**](mailto:info@boardc.at) **with a photo of your board. I'll review that it looks like a good fit, and get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks so much for the feedback everyone!!**
How do those of you with home walls approch setting climbs beyond your current level? There are some simple approaches to this. For example:

1. Move the holds further away.
2. Same moves, worse holds.
3. Try moves until there's one you can't do.

Those are obvious enough. I'm curious if anyone has a more thoughtful approach to the task.

What x-factors contributed to the greatest breakthroughs in your climbing? Hello all, 

I am interested in hearing about subtle factors that have influenced your climbing. I’m thinking more micro-beta things (the type of tape you use, skin care, breathing, climbing partners, climbing environment, etc) as opposed to physical training routines or experience on rock. 

An example for me was learning how to try climbs around stronger climbers without feeling embarrassed/anxious. 

Thanks again for your input, I hope I can gain some insight from your responses!
Diet, Body Mass/Image, and Climbing: ED Trigger Warning Here is my question: Do you all experiment with your diet in order to climb harder?  
Personally I have. I historically (last few years) sit around 165-170 (just under 6 feet tall) most of the year, but for bouldering season cut to 160-163ish and for sport/trad even lower (maybe 158ish?). I find that lower than these rough numbers I feel too sluggish and "ill" but above them, I'm not to my full snappiness and strength. 

But, when I am training I like to be higher in order to fully recover and feel healthy mentally and physically. I have also started supplementing creatine, which has helped my recovery and performance hugely (however it has skewed these numbers about 3lbs higher in my personal case.)  I don't find it hinders my endurance at all (in fact I have been able to send some of the harder routes I've ever tried since taking it). 

Basically: My question for y'all is this: What tactics do you use in order to trim down to a fighting weight? Do you find this sustainable? What do you like/dislike about this process? What are warning signs/red-flags you think to look out for re: relationship with food or body? Do you supplement cardio in order to balance your CICO ratio?
A review of my top x-factors to improve climbing performance post. Hello,

I just finished reviewing the comments from this community on my previous post about what x-factors resulted in your greatest gains in climbing. The responses were mostly really helpful, so I wanted to summarize them here.

Technical:

1. We had one response (+ comments) about gaining experience climbing on bad feet. I see this as a specific example of the broader advice of climbing on lots of different rock types, wall angles, and discipline (trad, sport, boulder, ice, etc). 

Physical:

1. Stretching. Essentially these responses claimed that consistent stretching and antagonist exercise helped their climbing the most. This makes sense, as you get stronger you need a stronger set of antagonist muscles to support the new strength. Implementing a consistent stretching routine is not something I have committed to, so I’m excited to try this one!

2. Eating well before sessions. This makes a big difference. I need to focus on finding the right balance of pre/during session foods/drinks to keep me healthy and feeling good. Another great point and something I can try.

3. Learning how to rest on the wall. This one comes from experience on rock, so I think this one can fit under improved technique from climbing on different rock types, wall angles, and in different disciplines.

Mental:

1. Try Harder. This is easier said than done, but it’s true for most anyone that they can exert more force/discipline than they are currently. Hugely important and worth the constant reminder.

2. Mindful Climbing. I think this is the most important response. It doesn’t matter how much you climb, if you don’t actively internalize movement, new techniques, and question yourself, you will not get better at anything. This includes analyzing why or why not a movement didn’t work, trying new things, and visualizing sequences. This was the most repeated response behind trying harder, but to me by far the most valuable. Try as hard as you want, but if you don’t learn every session, improvement won’t happen.

3. Motivations. Whether it’s having fun, pushing yourself, or just pure psych, many people said the most important improvement they made was in sorting out their motivations. Specifically, learning to let go of others opinions of you / expectations you put on yourself and just climb for you. Letting go of pressure and climbing hard for yourself will make you better and happier with your progress.

4. Self Deprecating Jokes. Only one person said this, but it’s interesting. I’ve never considered this and it’s worth exploring as sports psychologists often claim negative self talk can slow improvement and reduce performance(no citation, from a course I took).

5. Beta Videos. Beta videos can help you see how better climbers have done your project, so it can be a great learning tool. Just remember to try and figure some climbs out on your own first, as this trains you as well!

Thanks for the responses, I hope some of you benefit from this. Missing anything?
Results of my first hangboarding program, 2 months. Stupid gains. A little under 2 months ago (coincidentally when quarantine started) I began a max-hang program/cycle. I had done hangboarding for about 1 month prior, but only for rehabbing a tweaky finger, so I never went hard. I've been climbing for about 2.5 - 3 years. Prior to this I could send V4/5 in a couple go's, ditto with 5.11c-d (outdoors, at few different spots).

I used the Metolius Compact II. All holds were within 7-10 seconds. I used a simple counterweight system to remove weight. My height is 5'7" (170 cm) and weight 154 lb (70 kg). Here are the results after 15 hangboarding sessions.

* **+50 lb Pull-Ups \[Jugs\]**: 7 reps ---&gt; 10 reps
* **One-arm Sloper, Left:** \-40 lb (74% BW) ---&gt; -10 lb (94% BW)
* **One-arm Sloper, Right:** \-30 lb (81% BW) ---&gt; +0 lb (100% BW)
* **Half-Crimp \[15mm\]:** \+30 lb (119% BW) ---&gt; +70 lb (145% BW)
* **3-finger Drag, \[15mm\]:** \-10 lb (94% BW) ---&gt; +45 lb (129% BW)
* **Back-3 Half-Crimp, \[15mm\]:**  \-10 lb (94% BW) ---&gt; +12.5 lb (108% BW)
* **2-finger (pointer+middle) pocket, \[25mm\]:**  \-35 lb (77% BW) ---&gt; +25 lb (116% BW)

Some points that these numbers don't show:

1. My sessions were structured as follows: Light warm-up, first set of hangs at \~30% intensity, second set of hangs at 60-70% intensity, third set of hangs at 110% intensity (listening to [Of Mice and Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csh496MAD_0&amp;list=PLCBA06CCBDB900B85) :)
2. I would attribute a large amount of my 3-finger drag and 2-finger pocket gains to decreased discomfort in those positions. Over time the intrinsic pain of that grip has become less and less of a limiting factor. I hope to make a similar progression in middle+ring 2-finger holds in a later cycle.
3. Besides the max weighted pull-ups, the last set of numbers are probably slightly higher actually, but not by much. I chose weights slightly higher than my previous max, and surprisingly held many of them for more than 10 seconds.
4. I also trained core and antagonistic stuff throughout this program. I also go solo bouldering at some random boulders nearby (literally nobody ever goes there) whenever the weather is good, about 2 - 3 times per week.

Now time to start my first repeaters cycle! :)
Decreasing Skill Does anyone else get the feeling that, as they've matured as a climber, they've developed worse movement habits? I feel like I've noticed this in my climbing lately. I don't know what to chalk it up to. The likeliest explanation is that I spend a lot of time doing very power-oriented bouldering in the gym and much less time climbing routes outside (growing up! bummer!) but I think it also might be distraction, the lack of excitement I had in the early days. I'm not necessarily looking for advice but I'd love to hear similar stories!

Hip Mobility Workout Specifics for Climbing Hi All. I am a V7/5.12 climber, 29, office job 5x a week. I got a steroid injection for thumb tendonitis, so I figured now would be a good time to improve mobility. I have a mobility workout that I have been doing every other day. I end up doing about 30 minutes of TUT total.  My problem is I don't know if I am doing too much, too little, or the wrong exercises. 

I have terrible hip mobility, partly because of having club feet. I can tell it is limiting in my climbing. For example, on a route I was trying some time ago it was very, very difficult for me to lift my left leg up in order to place my left foot when I needed to use a drop knee that was on a foothold that was close to the extent of my leg reach. When I could get my foot on the foothold it was very weak and I couldn't really feel "strong" on the foothold when I applied force. It just felt weak. 

Here is a rough outline:

1) Froggie stretch, \~45-60sec, 6x (3sets, 2x each set)

2) Cross leg stretch (sitting cross legged one foot on the other knee), \~45-60sec same set as (1)

3) Bent knee stretch (sitting with one bent knee and other foot on the bent knee), \~45-60 sec same set as (1)

4) Side split attempts (See [https://youtu.be/x-1OJW3OMb4?t=1138](https://youtu.be/x-1OJW3OMb4?t=1138)) \~30 sec same set as (1)

5) Knee lunges while holding my foot \~30 sec same set as (1)

6) Hamstring lunge stretch \~30 sec same set as (1) 

Problem is - I have no clue if this is helping. I feel like maybe (2) is slightly easier after doing it for 4 months. The rest all feel about as stiff as always, every time I attempt them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1) How much mobility work is required to see an improvement? This may come across as lazy, but I am new to this and wanting to not become a mobility expert while still improving in climbing. I want to improve my mobility but not become a yogi.

2) My hamstrings are very, very tight. Doing the side split attempts in the video of (4) feels almost painful. Are tight hamstrings limiting in climbing?

3) Are there other stretches I should be accommodating?

4) Are strength exercises that work the hips likely to increase hip mobility also? 

5) I basically only do those above stretches, and don't incorporate anything new. Should I be finding new mobility to incorporate?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.
Morbidly obese, how to “train” during quarantine I am morbidly obese (BMI 42, 5’ 4”, 280lbs). As a kid I was a climber, grandparents had land with very climbable trees, and I generally enjoy being up in high places. So to me climbing seemed like a good place to start. 

Most of my exercise is either 5k training or BeatSaber. My diet isn’t great, and I’m getting help with that. There is a climbing gym in my town, closed during quarantine. Is there a guide of what exercises I can do at home or where I can start to prep for when the gym opens?
Recruitment Pulls and Density Hangs on same day? Or a cycle of Recruitment Pulls followed by a cycle of Density hangs? So, I've been following the Beginner version of the **Workout 1: Recruitment pulls** written in here [https://www.trainingbeta.com/the-simplest-finger-training-program/](https://www.trainingbeta.com/the-simplest-finger-training-program/)  in the section ***When and How Long – What the Program Looks Like***, I was rereading the article and now I'm not sure of something. When in the same section, on the **Workout 2: Density Hangs** he mentions "... Done after recruitment pulls" in the frequency row, does he mean I am supposed to do the **Recruitment Pulls** followed by **Density Hangs** on the same day, or is he saying that I should do one cycle of **Recruitment Pulls** and then one cycle of **Density Hangs**?   


I assumed he meant "Do one cycle(4-5 weeks) of Recruitment Pulls, then, one cycle of Density Hangs(4-5 weeks)". Therefore I'm only doing Recruitment Pulls at the moment and might do a cycle of Density Hangs after I'm done with the Recruitment Pulls, I'm 2 weeks in.  


By the way, has someone already done this program? And how were the results? :)
Should i train pockets if I don't climb pockets. So as now I'm able to climb on rock i want to boost my endurance and start doing some repeaters. I'm not really experienced in training endurance on the hangboard but now i'm forced to because the gyms are closed. 

My question is: is it beneficial to do some pocket repeater training on the BM2k as i'm not climbing on pockets. I know this is a very specific training but is going to transfer to 4 finger climbing.
To train or not to train? Hello folks,

This summer I will be leading a crew for 3 months in the wilderness with 5 day hitches and 2 days off.
Last summer as a crew member I was exhausted at the end of each day after hiking on average 12-18 miles a day. I rarely had the energy to do any climbing related training 

My question for you is what is the best way to utilize my 2 days off from work to gain climbing strength and other light activities that I could consistently do while out in the field. Are there any good lightweight portable training boards I could hang from a tree? Also I would preferably not like to be in a gym for the little time off I have so if there are any ideas for training on actual rock that would be great!
Homewall Setting Tips and Suggestions Now that a bunch of new homewalls have gone up what are every bodies tips/suggestions for setting/getting the most out of your homewalls?  I have had a home wall for 4 years, it's short 7ft 9 inches high but 12 ft wide.  Angle is 46 degrees.

Things I have learned.

1. Put up a wide range of holds.  Initially I only had a few jugs and few absolute garbage holds to hang onto.  This will encourage a bigger range of climbers to climb on your wall.  The more people you get on your wall the more potential new problems there are that you don't have to set. 
2. Feet - put a variety as well.  I know quite a few people say you should only have bad slippery feet.  But I find a good way to increase the difficulty is to set stuff you can barely do or have to project with the good feet then start trying to send them with the bad ones.
3. If you have a small steep board there is only so much crimping your fingers can take.  Get more slopers than you think you need.  They are more expensive but generally let you climb for longer or continue climbing when your nursing your way back from injury.
4. Spray wall, aim for a really high tee nut density and do your best to fill it.  This means shopping sales and comsetic seconds.   
5. Since I set 90% of the problems on my wall I'm constantly looking for ways to not just set to my style.  The two best things I have found are 1. To set replicates of both outdoor and indoor climbs.  2. Make a list of moves (rose, cross through, back step, drop knee, etc).  Then you can pick multiple moves randomly you have to set in a row or you can try and do the same style of move as many times as possible in one boulder.  The later if you make some climbs like this as part of your warm up ends up being really good technique training.
Afraid of being too light - A different kind of weight loss post It seems like every post about weight on this subreddit is about how to lose weight. Whether the question is overweight people trying to get into climbing, or perfectly healthy climbers trying to scrape out an extra V grade, its always about slimming down. 

I have the opposite problem, and recently I've had some significant weight loss without trying which has been frightening. First, a little personal background. I first hit my adult height of 6' when I was 17. I weighed 135lbs, and I was running about 45 miles a week. In college I replaced running with climbing and gained 5-10lbs a year, peaking winter of my senior year at about 167lbs. Physically I felt amazing, but the last 10lbs or so were driven by body image issues and a compulsive need to be "big". I ended up having some serious mental health issues that spring and dropping 10lbs in 6 weeks. I spent the summer weighing myself every morning, drinking a half gallon of milk every day, and lifting 3x a week, and I gained back up to 161lbs by August. A month in Kalymnos later I was sitting at 157lbs, but I'd moved, gotten a new job, and a healthier social environment. I no longer felt such a need to get size for size's sake, no longer had such a hard time with depression, and started seriously climbing again. This continued up until quarantine with me at about the same weight. Now I've stopped climbing because of access, but I do hangboard/pull ups/push ups/core 3x a week, and a short (&lt;2mi) run 2x a week on the off days. I hadnt weighed myself since the start of quarantine. 

Yesterday I did my first ever dead hang one arm pull up, which felt amazing, but the progress was slow. It took me 3 months to go from a pull up from just above deadhang to the full rep. I also have been feeling quite tired/cold much of the time. I also measured myself for the first time in 3 months, and I came in at 151 in the late afternoon.

This is scary. I feel like I'm at a healthy weight when I'm in the upper 150s, but unless I'm careful it seems to melt away. I eat what feels like a lot, and I just want to stay the same weight. It doesn't seem like it could be healthy to be this lean and losing weight. I just want to be able to recover from my workouts and continue to get stronger, but somehow I don't seem to be able to maintain weight without a ton of work. Im also frightened because the last time I lost significant weight without noticing was coupled with serious mental health issues. I think mentally I'm doing alright but it still makes me wary.

I apologize for the rambling post. I know there must be other people with the same issues, but the community often feels like it is singly focused on weight loss as a goal. If anyone else has been in a similar spot I'd love to hear your story.
A neurophysiological approach to returning to climbing Fact is, when the climbing spots reopen and climbing gyms are back we must return to our usual climbing gradually. There are important aspects to keep in mind such as revisiting basic technique, slowly increasing intensity and monitoring climbing frequency, and where your RPEs (rate of perceived exertion) should be throughout the process.

The main issue with motivation for training until the gyms or outdoor spots open is the uncertainty of our return to climbing outside or indoors. By having a foundation upon which you can practice movement skills and strength exercises during this period (which many of you are already doing) \[1\], we can move on to having a solid and structured plan when we are finally returning to climbing \[2\]. This will allow for a safe and healthy return to climbing, with fitness and injury prevention in mind as well as health longevity approach for long term fitness andperformance. \[3\]

\[1\] Many things have been mentioned on this subreddit before, such as flexibility and mobility exercises, hangboarding and bodyweight strength exercises. I will briefly mention the importance of each of the recommended practices.

Flexibility and mobility: These exercises will help you become more adaptable on the wall(being able to put your foot up high) and able to use your hands and feet in stretched out positions and able to get power into your movement from these positions (actually being able to pull and push from a high foothold). If not practiced this will create balance issues and will affect

Hangboarding: Obviously important for intermediate skill climbers and up, stronger fingers permit for more powerful pulling motions on smaller holds as well as being able to hold on for longer and at a lower rate of forearm pump. It is very important to maintain tendon strength and skeletal mass through this exercise.

Bodyweight strength exercises: A very important aspect of climbing, maintaining posterior chain muscles strengthened will keep your body tension strong, shoulder strengthening will permit for better movement up the wall as well as injury prevention, and abdominal exercises are important to climb strongly and get your feet up high. Calisthenics will not only maintain your power and muscle mass but also practice a skill, strength training involves technique.

These are just some of the benefits of these exercises, there are a lot more, this has been discussed before and there's lots of information on the internet for this.

\[2\] The importance of practicing movement as a skill and in fact is encouraging to practice these movement exercises to maintain body awareness, dynamic balance and to strengthen the neurological pathways.  The rate of decline in performance is not only due to muscle and tendon strength but is also the fact that climbing is really a technique oriented sport and is dependant on our mind-body connection. Climbing is a sport where perfect practice and precision movement is of the utmost importance. Without access to real rock or a climbing gym, the rate of decline in how expert one becomes at a skill has more to do with how one practices than with merely performing the skill a large number of times. Given the fact that we cannot train climbing, we may be able to train movement through a series of precision movement exercises.

The locomotive approach to proprioception is inherently valuable and this presents an excellent opportunity to practice ways to exercise your mind and body.  Precision movement practice helps to improve the body's balance and range of motion. It will allow for practice in quick movement and body dynamic body transition between two states. Practicing precision movement is important for climbing as we are constantly going from static to dynamic, dynamic to static, static to static, or dynamic to dynamic movement or any combination of 3 part of 4 part movement sequences.

The importance of the concepts of these types of movements is the improving of cognivitive function since movement and memory have strong neural links, a way to practice movement, balance, conservation of kinetic energy or momentum.

I invite you to read or watch videos about quadrupedal movement, primal movement, and plyometrics.  Proprioceptive training will lead to meaningful improvements in somatosensory and sensorimotor function. There is no program to follow: just do something. Nothing strenuous at all. These movements are novel movements.

Even if you didn’t lose as much strength as you thought or that you gained strength, you’re really going to be susceptible to fatigue when you start back, and this is why incorporating these technique concepts into training is fundamental to our neurophysiological abilities of proprioception, balance and kinetic movement.

\[3\] Maintaining good fitness and health is important, and the above concepts may mimick or translate well to climbing, but they do not replace actual climbing whether it is skill or physical endurance. It is important to not get carried away and to remember to follow safe protocols when returning to climbing. The key is to slowly try harder grades, and try harder over time. Climbing everyday a little bit, or climb a little bit hard every other day. Depending on your time schedule upon return and general fitness level, there are different methods to go by to prepare yourself during quarantine and have a solid return plan.

Think of this as a long term game, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years that you’re going to be training for, these three or six months isn’t going to mean a whole lot in the grand scheme of things. Sometimes risks need to be taken, or sacrifices must be made for our projects and pushing past our grades, this is an inherent risk in every sport and it is why we must be cautious with our approaches when returning to climbing. This is why a longevity approach to performance in climbing is super important and that is why we must have a structured foundation of good sleep, good nutrition, good exercise and good management of stress (stress affects digestion/nutrition, exercise/mental sport performance, sleep/recovery).

Wishing you well.

Edit: In response to a lot of the criticism I've added a few more paragraphs to my post. I feel I haven't been clear enough in explaining the science behind the concept of primal movement in regards to climbing training.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been of the belief that incorporating novelty in movement is one of the best options for increasing movement intelligence. A lot of things train skill but primal and novel movements stick out to me. There are plenty others, but my concept is something I've used extensively and has helped me with proprioception, balance and energy transfer on the rock and indoors. It also makes sense to take other sports like gymnastics, calisthenics, or slacklining which encourage the brain to get the most out of your neuroplasticity by protecting new and old neural pathways through novel movement and primal movement training.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only is it backed by neuroscience but it's actually really fun and good for your body. It is a shame that the reception of this concept has been so scrutinized and misunderstood. People are naturally drawn to exercises which grant immediate results, usually dopamine boosting exercises, because they can "feel" the results, but not all exercises will be easily felt. The main noticeable immediate benefit of novel movement through primal movement training might be proprioception, body tension awareness on points of contact and an increased ability of efficient kinetic energy transfer, but to say it applies directly to climbing above other exercise methods is not the point of this post, it is meant as a supplement to the lack of aforementioned benefits that are not practiced through hangboarding, strength training and cardio.

&amp;#x200B;

The research suggesting our brains follow a neuroplastic model of training. The model simplified is: you have a small pool of neurons that are dedicated up-front to a task, which you then iteratively optimize by deliberate practice. The brain is large and complex enough that when adding a new type of stimulus (novel movements, in this case primal movement) it will be calculating a vast array of previously learned functions (climbing technique) and making connections with the new skill or technique being trained (novel primal movement). Learning is then a process of figuring out which of the neural pathways is the optimal route for achieving a task. These connections are strengthening your previous learned ability to balance and co-ordinate kinetic movement learned from climbing experience by stimulating the growth of new pathways (from novel movement) through already establish neural pathways (previous climbing training).

&amp;#x200B;

The idea of optimizing the efficiency of neural pathways by making new connections through novel movements is done by using the same pathways trained through climbing and adding new paths from novel, primal movement.

&amp;#x200B;

When taking time away from climbing, the connections you stopped using have been trimmed, and so your movement reservoir is less diverse (also known as rustiness). By incorporating novel movements, the movements that incorporate balance, kinetic energy transfer and body tension let you respond more efficiently to what you know already, but since there's a difference there's less chance that climbing movements previously detrained will be trimmed, thanks to the new tasks that are similar but practice the same concepts (the reason why climbers are good at primal movement). The added benefits are not only seen when returning to climbing but even through climbing a lot of stiffness (unnecessary body tension) and kinetic energy transfer (dynamic moves) will be eliminated due to the added neural pathways that increase movement efficiency.
I Haven't Been to the Gym in Over Two Months, but I Just Climbed My Hardest Grade Ever. Hello all,  
I'm curious if anyone else has had a similar experience recently. My gym, like  most others, closed in early March. Before all of this pandemic stuff going on I would climb in the gym 2-3 times per week, and outdoors usually 1 day on the weekends. The hardest grade I had redpointed outdoors was 5.11d. Then the pandemic came and the gyms closed. I was worried about regressing, as I imagine many people were. Not only were the gyms closed, but there was strong encouragement from the community to not climb outdoors (which I agreed with). So I was left to my hangboard. I also purchased a pair of gymnastic rings to workout with a couple of times per week.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Fast forward until a couple of weeks ago... I've started climbing outside again. One climb I did was a 5.11b that I had climbed before, but it felt much easier than I had remembered. Fast forward again to last weekend, I redpointed my first 5.12a. While it was hard, it wasn't near as hard as I expected it to be. I feel like I've actually gotten stronger during the quarantine than I was beforehand when the gym was still open. This leads me to wonder if I'll go back to climbing as often in the gym once it reopens, or if I'll continue doing more hangboard and rings work. I'm curious if anyone else has found a similar result during these crazy times. Anyways, thanks for reading and stay safe!
need some new goals for 2020 Some of my goals for 2020 were to consistently climb V7 and V8 in my climbing gym and climb V5 outside(I could also probably climb harder outside but I don't have much outdoor experience), and there were one or two sport routes I wanted to send outside. I also wanted to be able to do a muscle up, front lever and one arm pullup. My gym and local crags have been and still are closed so I have not been able to focus on my actual climbing goals and instead have been focusing on the muscle up, front lever and one armers. However, I was able to do my first unassisted muscle ups earlier this February, I was able to do my first front lever about a month ago, and now I can do a one armer with my right arm and I am pretty close to being able to do it with the left arm. So I am in a position where I have completed half of my goals and don't have a chance to attempt my other goals. What would be some good fitness goals that I should set for my self? I have only a pullup bar, hangboard and pinch block to train with.
What does a limit-level route feel like? For those of you that have invested weeks or months or years into stuff, what does it feel like at the beginning? Every (sport) project I’ve ever done has gone down within a few days of being able to do all the moves, and I’ve usually been able to do all the moves the first or second day. How long do you spend stuck on individual moves before you decide if it’s possible or not? Do you spend more than one working burn per day at the beginning or does that usually end your day? Do you go in with certainty that it’s possible or are there a few days where you’re figuring out whether it’s worth the effort?
What supplements, if any, do you take for climbing performance? I've read a lot about various supplements and their benefits (as it pertains to climbing), but I'm curious how widely used supplements are in the climbing community.

If you take supplements, which ones and why? And if you don't, why not?

During climbing season when I'm training towards specific goals I usually train &amp; climb with:

  - **Creatine**: Seemingly improved power and power endurance
  - **Whey**: Muscle maintenance / growth
  - **Beta-Alanine**: I enjoy the paresthesia feeling while trying hard
  - **Caffeine**: Helps me focus and get pumped up before redpoint attempts
  - **Fish Oil**: General health

I'm really not trying to start a war on the efficiency or claims about any of these supplements, so hopefully the discussion can remain civil; I'm purely curious in what other people are doing with supplements if anything.
Does hangboarding have to be combined with other exercices to be effective? To clarify, by effective I mean that the forearms would constantly get stronger.

  

I come from a powerlifting background and if, for example, I would want stronger triceps, it wouldn't make any sense to do only tricep extensions forever. At a certain point, you will need to add some other exercises such as bench press or military press to break those plateaus.

  

Now in normal circumstances, I would supplement my hangboard workouts with climbing as well as some general strength exercises using my bodyweight and/or dumbbells. However because of the current lockdown, I only have access to a hangboard and nothing more. It might be possible in the near future to buy dumbbells though.
Let’s talk about TOES... Most threads are on fingers/pulling routines, but I wanted to see if people had much insight into maintain healthy and strong toes (more specifically big toes).

I have had off and on issues with my right big toe from getting overworked. I also know older climbers who have persistent toe problems. 

QUESTION: Are there routines/exercises out there for climbers to maintain healthy toes in climbing? Does anyone on here do anything specifically for maintaining their toes?
Rope drag simulator &amp; silly things about rope drag I made a Matlab program that simulates rope drag for climbing routes on a vertical wall and looked at some silly questions. Info about how friction is calculated and more about the program at the bottom. I realize this is all trivial, but I had fun with it.

If you have Matlab and want to play around with the script, it is published here: [code.](https://github.com/kylemathenia/Rock-Climbing-Rope-Drag-Simulator) This is basically the first thing I did with Matlab or coding, so go easy on the bad/noob practices. Lots of comments though :D

Based on:

* 30% humidity environment
* Mid-life 9.9mm BD non-dry rope

Drag isn't just double the single pitch (8 lbs), it's way more.

Max Rope Drag (lbs):

Perhaps obvious, but rope drag compounds on itself at every bend. The larger the bends, the faster the growth. Not exactly exponential growth, but kind of like that.

Also maybe worth pointing out, with a lot of compounding occasions, the total drag is really sensitive to small changes in the friction calculation. So small changes in angles make a big difference over a lot of bends. Same goes for coefficient of friction. A humid day or fuzzy rope could have big have a big effect for max drag over a lot of bends. So maybe don't try to climb your 70 meter linked mega proj with a fuzzy rope and no extensions? Already a bit obvious I suppose. But maybe fuzzy ropes are holding you back. I'm adding it to the excuse catalog.

Maybe the take away is that if you already have a lot of drag on a climb, it might be worth really prioritizing a straight line for the rope because the drag is increasing very rapidly with more bends at that point.

I realize this format isn't the best for comparing between routes, but I didn't want to give the effort.

**\*\*\*\*\*\*Does it matter if you zig zag at the beginning of a route?\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

I saw a post somewhere that claimed that zig zagging at the beginning of a rock climbing route doesn't really matter because the weight of the rope is so small that not much drag is created. Below compares zig zigging low vs high.

**Zig Zag Low:**

https://preview.redd.it/d6dtqdyq4c151.png?width=537&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a68108e4363b1d50b9f7d00989cb2368436b882e

Max Rope Drag (lbs):

&amp;#x200B;

**Zig Zag High:**

Max Rope Drag (lbs):

* 10.5636

Zig zagging high has a higher max. But if you zig zag low and end up zig zagging higher up, you might have a lot of bends and a lot of drag.

My take on this is that all of this doesn't really matter. Just EXtENd Ur PieCEs, make rope go straight, make rope no touch rock.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Sharp bends vs smoothed bends\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

**Sharp bends:**

https://preview.redd.it/37yq91ho4c151.png?width=537&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b63d56a62ee81ca991383a61ba7b3ee28864b3c5

Max Rope Drag (lbs):

* 15.5987

&amp;#x200B;

**Smoothed bends:**

Max Rope Drag (lbs):

* 14.8668

Not much less than 15.6 lbs for sharp corners in this case. Generally, I saw that smoothing out the corners doesn't matter much if the rope doesn't follow a much straighter total path. But f you 'smooth out' the corners so much that the rope follows a significantly more straight path overall, then there is significantly less drag. In this example you can see the rope is still pretty horizontal between bends 7 and 8 on the smooth path plot, so there was not much rope savings.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Traversing\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

Max Rope Drag (lbs):

* 2.3641

The simulation accounts for the drooping of the rope. That gives more accurate friction calculations. The droop was actually pretty accurate when I roughly tested it. Surely this would be off if the friction calculation is off due to fuzzier/different rope, humidity etc.

Rope path follows a catenary curve like you would expect.

https://preview.redd.it/glnoa4zrzb151.png?width=533&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f233f8c9388c67f20fc6cc3594633e424dc7e09

Program iterates between finding the path and calculating the forces. Different path &gt; different angle &gt; different friction &gt; different path.

If the traverse is too spaced out the program returns infinite drag, which represents a point where the rope would just keep drooping to infinity if the belayer didn't keep some tension.

**Too spaced:**

https://preview.redd.it/16v7bhiuzb151.png?width=533&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b67979709357f20211dda7110bf52bb514c2286

The program assumes no tension from the belayer. So no simulating Tommy's mega down climb pitch :(

The Capstan equation is commonly used for climbing ropes and carabiners from what I could find. I mean, it says so on Wikipedia and an MIT thing, so there is that.

[Rope Drag Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_drag) [.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Climbing_quickdraws.jpg)

[MIT Open Courseware - Rope Behavior](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/experimental-study-group/es-255-physics-of-rock-climbing-spring-2006/lecture-notes/MITES_255S06_rope_behav.pdf)

Compared to the general equation for friction, the capstan equation basically just accounts for the extra surface area as the rope bends more.

I didn't think the surface area would increase like the equation represents, so I did a garage experiment that was not scientific in any way.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lma8eroh0c151.png?width=711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f20af8b613964dfd9d6f582ce71d0697e0c6432

"Multiplier" is what the drag before the bend is multiplied by to get to the drag after.

(drag before) \* (multiplier) = (drag after)

That normalizes things so you can compare across different loads.

This is how they compare. 'multiplier' on y axis. Bend angle in degrees on x.

&amp;#x200B;

The experiment was almost not rigorous in any way. Didn't calibrate instruments, low sample sizes, no uncertainty consideration, etc. Inferences made here are loose at best lol.

My interpretation is that friction with climbing ropes and carabiners is probably closer to what you would expect with the general equation, FF=μN, which assumes constant surface area contact. I thought it was interesting that the equation I saw being used most often, the capstan equation, had by far a greater %error off of the experimental results, and bends the wrong direction overall. I don't really think that either of the equations really do a good job of describing friction with climbing ropes and carabiners.

Anyway, all the above results were calculated with a modified version of the experimental data trendline equation. Below like 2 lbs I found there is slightly more friction than the trendline suggests. Load did not appear to affect friction above that. I know that isn't what the data above shows. I'm sure that data had relatively high uncertainty and error. Without the correction, the rope seems to droop to infinity at much less traversing distance than in reality at small loads. I did a little more careful testing  later and think there is some small load dependence at small loads, and I think the corrected equation better reflects reality.  You can select between several different equations for friction in the program.

Homemade Tension wall and holds I wanted to make a moon board to train on when COVID started so I did the research on the size, angle, etc. I then stumbled on the Tension board.   I originally ordered the moon board holds but since they were backed up on orders it was almost a 2-month delay. As I waited I did more research on Tension and decided I would make the hole patterns to fit them both. As time went on it became apparent I would not get holds from Tension or Moon due to COVID. So I decided I would make them my self. I used the pictures and measurements of the site and did my best to make them as accurate as possible.l I know this is not a "real" tension board but I am hoping I will still get the usage from the app and training gains from it.  Down the line ill visit a place that has a tension board and feel how all the holds are and modify with time and when Tension opens up for business ill try and get some defective holds so I can compare the size and in cuts and again modify mine as needed.  Let me know if you know anyone who has made their own tension holds and if you have any feedback or insights. Thanks for reading, your comments and hope you all stay safe and train hard! 

That's my tiny house I built in the back as well,  the tension board is built in 3 pieces and able to be broken down when I move so its modular as well!

I made a video going over the evolution of my thought process as to why I was plateaud for so long. You guys definitely gave me a wake up call a few months ago about my technique needing improvement and not my finger strength, so thank you! Featuring comments from you guys!
Rock Climbing mindset Hi, just wanted to know what you guys do to get into "the zone" when it comes to climbing. Any meditation exercises, songs you listen to, or anything else to get you mentally ready for climbing. I like to watch videos of elite climbers before climbing. What do you guys do?
Viewing your Mountain Project Tick Pyramid Hi folks,

I'm posting to see if there is an interest in [this](https://app.warriorsoftheweekend.com) tick pyramid app that we recently built. For those of you who use mountain project to tick your climbs, it will pull your ticked climbs into a visual pyramid to help you track your progress. 

We've seen tick pyramids talked about a lot and think it's helpful for building a strong base in grades below/at your hardest send, to help you get better and stronger for the next grade. We think that visualizing the pyramid is a really nice tool for keeping stoke up about climbs that aren't at your max, but will still help you dial down technique and get better overall.

When you tick a climb on mountain project it is public information, and is associated with your mountain project account. For the app, when you enter your email that is used for your mountain project account, it pulls your ticks and lays them out in a pyramid. 

Right now this is only implemented for route climbing. There are a few different pyramid styles that are explained in our blog. The app let's you choose your ideal grade and overlays your pyramid with an ideal pyramid, based on the popular suggestions from coaches like Eric Horst. You can also choose to not show the ideal pyramid.

I'm wondering if this is something that is useful to the climbing community. I know that not everyone uses mountain project to log climbs, but for those who do, is this something you would use? We've been using it the last couple of weekends, and it's really fun to add a climb and see it visually when you send.
Board Training is something I’ve invested a lot of time into over the years and I’ve found a selection of rules that if followed really help get the most from your training

We have already had amazing feedback about out new APP [Grippy](http://get-grippy.griptonite.io/) but now want to make it even better. We're working on a "Benchmark" feature so people can (anonymously) compare against similar climbers. Its "chicken and egg" though, we need a modest dataset to even get going...

Overcoming injury/staying in shape while you can't climb Hi all, 
A few days ago I was out climbing and tore my peroneal retinaculum in my ankle (on what would have most likely been my first one hang on a project that was coming along quickly, bummer). It's looking like surgery is imminent and the post op recovery time is roughly 3 months. I'm definitely down but am going to continue hangboarding and doing ring exercises as I can been during quarentine.

 Does anyone have any worklds of advice or resources for dealing with long recovery times without climbing in terms of both physical and mental training/recovery?
Interestingly enough, despite my body getting weaker over quarantine and losing a ton of muscle, my mental game got so much stronger. [removed]
Tips on stopping barndoor I notice I am very bad at controlling barndoors. Specifically every so often boulder problems start with two hand holds close to each other and you usually have to lean back, you have one foothold and the wall/foothold is tilted a little bit. This type of start causes me always problems.

I think it's quite important to use the free leg to try to stabilize but I still end up flying away from the holds. Does it just come down to core strength or are there some technique tips I should keep in mind?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cn18ufp0ry251.jpg?width=374&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2041274cf747ab2c00154c72f9c34d732fc3cece

Edit: Seems like my A+ visualization is maybe not good enough. Something like this [https://nicros.com/wp-content/gallery/training-articles/technique-2-la-bouldering.jpg](https://nicros.com/wp-content/gallery/training-articles/technique-2-la-bouldering.jpg) but with only one foothold that is quite close under where the hands holds are.
How do you manage sit starts as a small person? I'm 1.65 meters (5.4 feet) and sometimes I can't even start the boulder problem because I can't touch the starting holds when I sit. So I fold my crash pad a try to cheat my way up to the holds. But then, is the send valid ?
Falling on Slabs Im hoping you fine people can help me understand how to control falls on slab routes.

Storytime: I decide to lead a route on the upper end of my onsight level. The mountain project page mentions it is a bit run out and one should avoid falling on the route due to some limestone cheese grater consequences. I push through a couple mental cruxes at the lower bolts and get to a place where I'm pretty comfortable with the idea of falling but am losing energy because I spent way too much time on the lower parts. I end up falling right at the next bolt and taking ~20' fall. During the fall it seems like my feet stayed on the wall or I dragged them on the way down because I ended up going head first. Luckily my back took all the impact and my head was fine.

Thinking back on this, I'm wondering what I could've done to prevent turning upside down in this case. In general falling on slabs scares me more now than it had previously.

Does anyone have any advice to help me climb harder on slab routes without the fear of repeating this incident?
How to keep feet on after going for a long, extended move? As the title suggest, I realized I can hold tension fine when everything is compact. However, with moves that are close to my span, I just fall off. I can't keep my feet on. This is even more apparent when feet are in front of me, not underneath (like getting out of the bottom to the top of a boulder outside). I am not sure what I need to work on. I can't make static moves when I get stretched out.
Lumbrical injury from 3 finger drag So recently I have been training a bit more my 3 finger drag in the hangboard (been training halfcrimp in the hangboard for a year already) and I notice it puts so much stress in my ring finger. But since I heard it is pretty safe I just kept going.
But last time I did it I felt a lot of pain after my session in the palm of my hand when I move or use my ring finger. So I stopped training it.
A week later while climbing I used the 3 finger drag in a crimp and felt the sharp pain again which made me stop the session. And now I can feel it while moving my hand. And I can't put any weight on a 3 finger drag due to the sharp pain.
I read it could be a lumbrical injury.
Does anyone has any expirience with it and what you did to treat it?
Bechtel's second book on logical progression is out. Read the first, and it was so good for people who don't necessarily train in blocks due to having somewhat year-long climbing seasons.
Looking for advice on how to train more accurate feet and not readjusting hands while inside in a gym. I never do this inside. This was my 4th time on this climb, Magnum Opus, on the first day of ever getting on it. Thanks!
Effective 10-Minute Rotator Cuff Training for Climbers (Eric Horst) with Gifs I've really just compiled some notes for myself to reference prior to climbing and thought I would share.

Select a 5, 10, or 15 pound dumbbell that you can achieve 15-20 reps with.

**1. Dynamic warm-up of the rotator cuff (2 minutes)**

**2. Standing External Rotation — 15 to 20 reps (45 seconds):**

With your arms bent at 90 degrees, lower until forearms are parallel to the ground. Repeat at a moderate pace until you've reach 20 reps.

&amp;#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/gzthj3/video/g7d6hhimmx351/player

**3. Lying External Rotation – 15 to 20 reps (45 seconds):**

Lay on your side and place a rolled up towel on your hip. Have your arm at 90 degrees and lift until just shy of vertical. Make sure to keep your elbow locked onto the towel.

&amp;#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/gzthj3/video/sh65xzvtmx351/player

**4. Reverse Fly – 15 to 20 reps (45 seconds):**

Brace against a bench or platform so you can get low enough that your torso is near horizontal. Lift the dumbbell out to the side maintaining a straight arm. Keep your back straight and core tight. At the top position think about pulling the scapula into the spine.

&amp;#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/gzthj3/video/fxi1lfspmx351/player

**5. Dumbbell Scaption – 15 to 20 reps (45 seconds):**

Stand with a slight bend in knees and hips and a fully engaged core. Hold the dumbbells with your palms facing each other. Lift your arms up the scapular plane or 30--45 degrees out from midline. Pause at the top and then slowly lower to the starting position. This is a relatively hard workout so you won't need any more than 3-10 pounds for 20 reps. Remember, this is a warmup.

&amp;#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/gzthj3/video/rhuznawqmx351/player

**6. Lying Internal Rotation – 20 reps (45 seconds):**

Using a bench allows for a slightly larger range of motion but you can also do this on the floor. Start with the dumbbell at the belly and slowly lower until forearm is parallel to the ground. Immediately lift the dumbbell back to the starting position. Continue for 20-25 reps making sure to keep elbow locked to the bottom of the bench and tucked in by your side for the entire range of motion.

&amp;#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/gzthj3/video/zgrjbcgcmx351/player

**7. Repeat exercises #2 through #6. (4 additional minutes)**

Do this workout 3 times a week and you'll help strengthen your rotator cuff and set yourself on the way to becoming a better stronger climber.
Mental “cues” for maintaining core tension when Toeing-in on overhangs? Now that my local gym has a limited re-opening, the pause in climbing has allowed me to see major areas of improvement with fresh eyes. 45 degree overhang being the biggie when I climbed (and then fell repeatedly) these boulder routes last night.

Obviously (cause ya know, physics) this is the hardest position to climb well: and yet like many on here, I aspire to improve this angle as it’s fun to learn new stuff. As background, I’ve been entering an intermediate level of bouldering (flash many V5s, send most V6s and the occasional V7 indoors) for the last 1 year on most angles EXCEPT 45 degree-ish.

Are there mental cues that the technically savvy on here use to cue their bodies? I’m looking for nitty gritty details: ex. doing an angular deadpoint to a crimp, my feet are angled away from me at 45 degrees.... do I think of posterior pelvic tilt? Am I focusing on calf flexion? Etc.).

I recognize a wall of text will never replace practice practice practice. However, some guiding cues would be very appreciated. 

Most articles I’ve found online only offer rudimentary explanations of moves (i.e. “this is a heel hook and you pull down”). Couldn’t get it to translate well into practice until I had a few coaching sessions and the coach cued “see how your heel is parallel with the hold? Try making it more perpendicular.”..... suddenly the next hold was floating towards my reaching hand.

Thanks community!

EDIT: didn’t necessarily mean to put “core tension” in title though understand that’s generally implied.
I need help choosing between The Hard Truth and 9 out of 10 climbers. I’ve enjoyed and applied content from Dave M and Chris H over the past few years and I really appreciate both of them. I know 9 out of 10 is a classic, but I’ve also heard it’s poorly structured/ hard to tie up all the loose ends. 
The preliminary reviews of The Hard Truth look quite good. 
Do you have a recommendation for which I should get first?
Not Sure Where To Post This... Had a Lot on my Mind Lately I'm wondering about what my future goals should be and trying to decide how I should be treating climbing right now. 

I climbed v13 a couple months ago, finally finished a 30 ft v11 I've been working on, a 6-year project v10, and just finished up an oldschool v13 litz rig. I thought I'd be pretty excited about sending hard climbs, but recently I feel as if putting in all this effort just to send a handful of boulders is barely worth the time. I miss the days of just going out to the boulders and climbing tons of easy stuff with the homies and a fat spliff. Maybe it's not worth it after all. Maybe more people should put an effort into just chilling outside on the rocks rather than putting in countless days of effort just to send one or two 'hard' boulders. 

I feel like bouldering would be a much more inclusive activity if this were the case, but I guess that's just conjecture at the end of the day. But I digress...

Lately I feel bummed as soon as I send a project because I know it only means it'll be a while until I actually get to the top of something else, and so on. It feels like work picking out projects and the effort that goes into sending them seems to outweigh any actual sense of achievement I get from 'success'. 

Anyone gone through periods like this? And if so, what did you learn from it?
What do you use/do to improve your climbing, besides climbing? I guess this is the whole reason we all come here together in this forum, but couldn't find a centralised place that tried to bundle everything.

So, the simple question:

What tactics, tools, routines, favorite books, exercise habits, tips, tricks, methods and others do you use to improve your climbing?

For me (climbed about a dozen 7as, 1 7a+):

* Climbing with my girlfriend. Endless motivation, being able to push each other and spot where you're going wrong.
* Climbing with a buddy that's at my level. Really helps to pull harder, to figure out beta together.
* Training for Climbing book. Helped me understand and make sense of how training and climbing even work
* Climbing above my grade. I've learned so much about body positioning, foot placement, and core tension from trying to figure out moves above my grade by climbing them while filming myself.
* Linear periodisation. Keeps it fun, helps me push hard.
* Watching tons of youtube movies to understand how the pros do it.
* Private coaching at local gym. 3 lessons at 90 euros. Wouldn't necessarily do it again. Was hoping to learn more ground-breaking stuff.
* Since covid, started using TRX more together with an app called monkii. Feel a lot stronger because of it, though I'm having a bit of difficulty applying it on the wall up to now. 

Things I considered but didn't do:

* Online training schedules. Figured I could also figure all that stuff out myself
* Online coaching. Didn't feel it was the right fit for me, thought it was quite over-priced often-times (or badly explaining the value, depending on your perspective)

Excited to see what this looks like for others!
Fingers lock up after prolonged/heavy hang When I hangboard and hold on intensely, weighted or if I'm holding an edge for 20s or so, my fingers will lock up in that position. I can close my fist but opening my hand and extending my fingers is slightly difficult and hurts a bit in the joints.

I've hangboarded infrequently on and off. I've been climbing around 4 years now. 150 lbs, when I'm hanging with added weight I'm hanging with up to ~50lbs on 18mm. 

I often also have difficulty closing my fingertips to the top of my hand. I have to do fingerglides after I climb to restore that mobility.

I'm 24 year old male at 5'7". 

Any idea what this is and how to prevent it?
The training advice that no one likes to hear 1. **If you hate training it, you probably should-** Everyone has a least favorite type of training/climbing. If you groan at the thought of a core workout, grimace when you think of falling off a slab, or can't remember the last time you tried stretching, you probably really need to do it. The things we train the least are where the majority of gains are to be made. What's easier- adding 5lbs to the max hangs you've done consistently for a year, or improving your frog stretch that you haven't tried in a year?

2. **Flexibility is key-** This is one of the lowest hanging fruits there is when it comes to risk vs. reward and carry-over to climbing. 10 minutes a day of hip, hamstring, and shoulder stretches will revolutionize your climbing- your ass won't sag on the wall, you won't move like a tin man, and Dave Graham will be thoroughly impressed with your new found beta breaks. 

3. **Keep a training log-** Yes, it can be annoying to fill out, but it'll become the most valuable tool you have after just a few months. At the minimum, write down the problems you tried and relevant information such as wall angle, hold type, and why you fell if you did. One step better would be adding up your grade sum and calculating average grade for your sessions. This can be done in a notebook, a phone app, or written on your arm with chalk if that gets you to do it. How will you know what direction your training needs to go if you have no idea where it's been?

4. **Plan for recovery time-** We all love this sport, and taking easy days/weeks is hard when the psyche is high. Your body needs time to recover, both mentally and physically. Gains don't come with training, they come with resting AFTER training.

This sport rewards mileage, dedication, and experience- all of which are learned through actually climbing. You could have the most bomb proof fingers in the world, but if your body positioning is shitty it won't even matter. There's no secret to improving at climbing- there's no hangboard workout that will bring you from v4 to v10 in a month, or even a year. Even for the most talented, genetically gifted, hard working climbers **IT TAKES YEARS.**

Should I Keep Hangboarding/Weighted Pulls? Hey all! For the past 4 months I have hanged consistently 2x week. I went from -9 to 67 workout weight on half crimp in 3lbs increments, im pulling around 75 workout weight. I believe some gains had to do with getting used to strict HC and learning how to hang. I just finished building a 45 degree woody and feel grateful I can now hold on to/pull on smaller holds. I find it hard to manage both this high intensity work and climbing though.I have definitely just began to see diminishing returns in the hanging and pulling. I really want to achieve some goals with hanging and pulling in itself, but mainly I want to be able to climb hard outside with limited time. Its definitely a weekend warrior scenario. The crazy thing is i've never climbed v4 outside. I have only been climbing outside around 10x. My thoughts are to quit working hangs and pulls altogether, do a max hang and max pull assessment, and start setting hard moves for myself on the woody. I know its not climbing season. What would you do if you were me?
When it's time to incorporate campus board training into my routine? Let's start with my current climbing level. So far i have sent 2x8a sport routes (5.13b). One of them is an endurance test with a crux on the last move and the other one starts off with a hard boulder problem. 

As I started hangboarding my level of climbing jumped high and i'm happy to say that this type of training is really beneficial for me. So i started questioning myself will the other most famous training tool - the campus board can help me. 

How can i know if i need more power?  I can say i'm fairly strong, doing 5-6 one arm pull ups but on the campus board i have done only a 1-4-7 although i had never really trained on it. Do you think my strength levels don't match my power level? 

Share your own experience with the campus board. When did you started? How you progressed on it? How it translated on the rock? How often did you have train on it? And what exercises you saw the most benefits in?

Thank you! Good luck and stay strong guys and girls!

Training pinch without climbing during quarantine Hello :)

Like most of you guys, I've been in quarantine, therefore far from Rock or Gyms, but I dont really expect to go back to a climbing gym near in the future(and rock is limited to the weekend). At first I thought the quaratine would be less months, so I started hangboarding to improve my half-crimp and open hand strength by doing the **Recruitment Pulls** followed by the **Density Hangs**(according to this post [https://www.trainingbeta.com/the-simplest-finger-training-program/](https://www.trainingbeta.com/the-simplest-finger-training-program/)). I've been doing them on the same workout, 2 times per week. But now I think it might be a good idea to also train my pinch.

My main question is, if I get a pinch block(and train with the form that Eric Horst suggests [https://trainingforclimbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pinch-block-XL.jpg](https://trainingforclimbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pinch-block-XL.jpg), as in lifting it from the floor) can I emulate the same workout with them? I thought that for **Recruitment Pulls**, I would put on a weight heavier than I can lift, and would pinch and try to lift it for 3-5 seconds. While for the **Density Hangs** part I would put on a weight that makes me fail around 20 seconds.

Want to know your thoughts about copying the protocol for pinch blocks.

But I'm also interested on how you would incorporate it to an existing routine. About this part, as far as I undertstand, pinch training mainly trains your thumb, and if the pinch is wide and you are lifting it from the floor you also train your forearm extensors, so I would say it is kind of different from hangboarding on edges. What I want to know is, is it wrong if I add pinch train while keeping the rest of the hangboard routine? Or should I do something like, drop the open hand and train pinch instead? Or just keep my hangboard routine on one day, and do the pinch train separate in the following day?

I know that to answer this last question in a safe way, you guys would need more info about me, but right now and to not ask so many questions at once, I'm just looking for your general thoughts and what you guys find that worked the best for your pinch training and/or forearm extensors.
How to try hard? I'm really into trying hard. The most psyched i'm when i see a friend that is just almost falling and still climbing a few moves more or even sending the route. For me trying hard when climbing or training is the single most important thing (my own opinion). 

So i found that sometimes i have trouble with trying hard. There are times when i climb when i really try hard and i see the results of it, numerous times i have sent a routes even if i thought i would fall long before the chain. But on the other hand there are times when i just don't commit to the maximum for a move and i just fall. 

How can I improve this aspect of my climbing? Share some experience. What thoughts are rushing into your mind when you're trying hard?
I've been climbing for 15 years and there's been a number of technique "hacks" that I've come across that made a huge difference to my climbing. Some of these you may know, but I'm sure there will be a couple you've never thought off :D Hope you guys enjoy!
Anyone else find that they're actually stronger / able to send harder grades after returning to the gym from quarantine? [deleted]
Does Rock Climbing take place of my back/bi day at the gym? Hey guys,

When I go to my weightlifting gym I just do a simple push/pull/leg split as a way to keep the rest of my body in shape when not climbing, but I've been wondering if maybe I don't need to be doing a pull day? I climb very regularly (3/4 times a week) and I was thinking I probably get more of a workout from those sessions than when I go to the gym. Are there any specific muscle groups or movements that I am strengthening by doing a pull day at the gym that I am ignoring if I just were to climb?

For reference, I am a V8/9 and 5.12 climber

I also do not care too much about lifting crazy high amounts of weight (being able to row 300lbs) I find much more satisfaction from endurance (being able to do 30 pull-ups confidently). 

Any tips or advise is greatly appreciated :)
What have you done that has made a noticeable difference in your recovery? I'm curious what you folks have done that has made a noticeable difference in your ability to recover. It could be anything from more leafy greens to cold/heat exposure to collagen supplements to sleeping on your back instead of your side. I don't care, let 'em fly! \*Please\*
Climbing Finger Strength Analyzer 2.0 &amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ejarw5olyl851.jpg?width=1507&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83243d3740cb9838dcf146452db6161d15dd6dc6

Hi!

I've recently been working on improving my Finger Strength [Analyzer tool](https://strengthclimbing.com/finger-strength-analyzer/). The basic idea is that a climber's bouldering level is correlated with their finger strength relative to their body weight. The tool's initial version was based solely on the results of the [maxtograde survey](https://toclimb8a.shinyapps.io/maxtograde/), but the accuracy was not satisfactory. So I analyzed the input data sets that lead to errors, and based on the conclusions, I introduced some modifications to the algorithm.

The first thing that I noticed is that many people report climbing much harder than what their finger strength test results would suggest. I believe that the main reason for that could be that they underperform in the test because they do not carry it out properly in the first place.  In order to obtain accurate test results, it's necessary to warm up thoroughly and also to make sure that the finger flexor muscles are well recruited, which means that it's necessary to perform at least 3 - 4 attempts. You can find some useful tips on how to do the test properly in the post under the Analyzer app.

The second thing is that the test will produce a different outcome depending on the type of hangboard training one's been doing in the past few weeks. People who regularly train with weighted hangs will be able to add much more weight than those who train with Repeaters or those who don't use the hangboard at all, but they can all be bouldering on a similar level. I tried to take that into account by introducing empirical modifiers, and it seems to have worked.

Another issue is the climber's height. I know some very strong climbers with a lot of experience and good technique, who could send harder grades if they were a bit taller. The topic is controversial, and it raises a lot of disputes, but by compensating for height and arm span, I was able to improve the accuracy of the algorithm.

Next, I tested the Analyzer by crosschecking it with the results reported by Reddit users in the [climbharder survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/6693ua/climbharder_survey_results/) from 2017. The survey contains 555 records, out of which 157 were useful for testing the app, as they contained all the required information. I went through all the useful records and gave the algorithm a final fine-tuning.

Finally, I analyzed the test results of Adam Ondra, Alex Megos, and Magnus Midboe, which are available on the internet, to check the accuracy at the high end of the spectrum. You can find the basic analysis of the results in the post under the Analyzer app. 

Anyway, I hope that you will have fun with the tool. I created it for educational purposes to better understand the key factors determining the performance on the rock. I think it's pretty useful, and it's possible to get some interesting insights if you get creative with it.

Still, the tool is under constant improvement, so I will appreciate any constructive feedback that could help me enhance it in the future. Remember that this is only a theoretical model, and no model is 100% accurate! :) If your results seem terribly off, please don't hesitate to let me know!
Let's Write a Home Wall Wiki Entry Hey friends.

A (very) detailed tutorial to improve the wrist and ankle strength, which are known as the two common weak points in athletes.
How to start doing one arm pull-ups? Currently I can do 14 consecutive strict form pull-ups, but I can’t even start a one arm pull-up. I can’t even properly do one arm negatives or lock offs. How do I start?
Where to practice falling in Front Range ? Leading sport is scary and seems to be getting no easier after a month or so of climbing outside 3 times a week.  

The tribal advice seems to be to start practicing falling, to expose one self to the sensation of falling , or to learn proper techniques falling .  Seemingly to be less afraid of falling , I must practice falling.  Which makes sense 

So....I am looking for some insider knowledge from people in the front range who may have some recommendations for where to go to practice taking leads falls since the gyms are closed.

All the easier routes are mostly slabs and/or staggered ledges which makes falling kind of out of the question it seems like. 

Please help! I really want to learn to climb for real, but can’t get past being way too timid leading sport routes of any difficulty. 

For context I have even lead some trad pitches in eldo and honestly felt less afraid when it’s vertical falls zone than I am leading these 5.7-5.8 slabs in clear creek and boulder canyon.

Thanks so much for any replies,

Sincerely Out-of-town-Coward

I'm 18 years old, i'm climbing for almost 3 years but i have some background of calisthenics. Now i have sent two 8a's (5.13b) and i'm on the path of sending another one. I can't say 8a is at my limit because i have climbed those for 5-10 attempts and it really felt not really hard.

Weaknesses:
I have a strong back and biceps also a strong core but my finger strength for sure don't match my climbing level (i'm hanging on a 20mm edge with +20kg for 7 sec). 

What i search for:
Now as i progressed i want to start being a little bit more serious with training and i don't have the money to buy all the books out there or subscribe to a online training regime so i decided that the best option is to buy a book and follow all the steps in it.

What i want from climbing:
So first of all i want to climb outdoors as much as i can so that means when the school comes i will be able to go rock climbing only on weekends and i will every weekend. So i need a book that allow me to structure my training along with outdoor climbing even if i'm not in shape for sending my hardest route. For me being outdoors is enough. 

On the other hand I really love climbing and i want a book that will help me introduce periodization in my training, also show me how to incorporate some exercises for climbing in the best way but still leave some room for climbing. I have heart that the RCTM don't really leave room for climbing. I also now about logical progression but i have tried non-linear periodization for a year now and i want to experiment with linear periodization for some time. 

I will be greatfull to those who read the whole post and make their suggestions! Good luck and stay strong!
What would you say is most holding you back in climbing I’ll start. For me, it’s a fear of falling. It causes me to hesitate on any moves that require dynamic movement, which wastes a lot of energy and then I’m more tored by the end of the route than I should be. It also makes me jump off when I start to doubt that I can go any further.  

I’ve been climbing for seven months (not including a two month covid break), and I have a lot of v4s and one v5 (in my style) under my belt. My gym is about a grade or two below outside grades. If I could overcome my fear of falling, I could be so much better
Can we talk about this guy please I saw this posted in another thread.
https://vimeo.com/435773752

Oh my god, what is he doing to his fingers?? Is this a meme or serious? Is he seriously putting metal clamps on his fingers to train? The hardcore version off taping your pulleys? He seems reasonably strong though, his action direct replica is impressive. So what is he doing here? Has anyone tried something like this? Is it as bad of an idea as I think? 

Cheers
When to start weighted pull ups? Just wondering at what point does it become more effective to add weight rather than increasing reps of pull ups in order to increase strength. And does anyone know the best set/rep routine, including rest?
5 year plateau, what to try next? As the title says, been stuck at the V4 level (outside grades) for 5 years now. Been climbing for about 8 years total and have 4-5 solid years of training under my belt. Feels like I’ve hit a wall where nothing gets easier. 

Little bio for reference:
185cm (6ft), 74kg (~160lbs) 10-12% body fat 
Max hang, 8 secs, 20mm, 150%BW
OPU both arms
Strict 10 second front lever

Done multiple training routines over the years, Anderson brothers, power company, training beta, lattice...

Read most of the books out there. 

Overall I’ve sent a few 4’s and have some multi year long v5/6 projects that I have put 100+ of attempts on over dozens of sessions. 

I know my technique could use work, but I’m sure you could say that about anyone. I would think that at my strength, even fumbling around for a year or two I would have sent a v5 or two. 

Anyways, anyone else struggling at this level, any words of encouragement, or any advice?
 
Thanks!
Tailored Shoe Discussion Hello fellow senders, 

I am an Industrial Design student developing a tailored rock climbing shoe product-service system and am in need of input from you, the climbing elite.

Firstly, if you want to discuss absolutely anything related to rock climbing shoes, foot orthopaedics surrounding climbing or have any thoughts on a tailored shoe, I'm open to any and all related direct messages. 

Secondly, if you know of any professionals willing to part their expertise please put me in touch.

Finally, if you have a spare 2 minutes to fill out my survey I would be eternally grateful! [https://forms.gle/TEXtV1nDtjYkhN167](https://forms.gle/TEXtV1nDtjYkhN167)

 Moderators, if this isn't appropriate please get in touch.
Food at the crag I'm becoming more and more convinced that eating REAL FOOD at the crag is the only way to go for a decent climbing day, particularly after listening to the recent Nugget episode with Paige Classen. I recently went on a 2 week trip to the Wild Iris, which, while it has relatively reasonable approaches and such, is still a fairly exhausting place to climb, especially coming from sea level. The hikes are exposed to the wind, the sun beats down on you, and crags like Lower Remuda have legitimately taxing approaches that leave one relatively tired before you even get there.

I decided to stop bringing nuts and bars and dried fruit, which is my usual crag diet, and started cooking myself a big bowl of pasta or rice with some protein beforehand, and bringing a bottle of instant coffee to wash it down. I brought a variety of things to the crag: leftover curry with brown rice, wheat pasta with italian sausage and garlic, butter noodles with cheese, things like that. What I noticed immediately was that, relative to the space they took up in my pack, I felt much, much more fresh when I took the time to sit down and eat a real meal (sometimes over 2-3 sittings) while warming up and in-between burns. I saw progress with some nagging injuries, and I started sending and linking at a much higher rate immediately. Essentially, I looked to complex carbs, fat, and protein, and let my body handle the rest. I used gallon plastic bags so I didn't have to mess with tupperware containers that might come open. 

I think this is maybe one more example of climbers trying to look for some sort of packaged solution to fundamental problems that any exercise presents. Weight lifters, basketball players, and other athletes rarely spend 8-10 hours of their day at or hiking to the gym/court/whatever, and they certainly wouldn't expect to do so without a lunch break. I have a feeling that most athletes would be shocked by how little climbers actually eat in the way of real food throughout the day. If you're out cragging... how often do you eat a real lunch? Is that lunchmeat sandwich really making you feel good? Is that 3rd CLIF bar good for your digestive system? You're burning a ton of calories relative to a non-climbing day, but what's the caloric content of your crag lunch? I would guess that, if my experience is at all typical, it's substantially less calories and much less nutrient-dense than the lunch you would normally have were you not at the crag. 

What are your experiences? What do you bring to the crag? Why am I wrong?
Mini Moonboard Has anyone tried the mini moonboard? 

https://moonclimbing.com/mini-moonboard-diy-kit.html

General thoughts? 

My ceilings are 9ft and I doubt my HOA will let me build a full size one in my little yard. Seems like a decent compromise.

This is the only thing I have found so far that showcases it a bit:

Best Climbing Vids on the Web Hey gang,
I just underwent a pretty serious surgery that has me on bedrest for a minimum of 2 weeks. That means zero climbing, probably for at least the next month.

I know many of us have had limited access to climbing due to covid, health issues, financial constraint, or other stressors during these incredibly tumultuous times. For me, watching climbing videos and sort-of living vicariously through others on the wall is helping me cope. 

Therefore, I thought this commmunity could bennefit greatly from a thread that collects the absolute best (and free!) climbing videos on the web. I've personally been following the Austrain Summer Series on youtube - this is (probably?) the only "live" competiton action we'll see all summer, but I'm sure there are a ton of other videos out there for climbing geeks like myself.

I'll get the ball rolling:
13 mins - youtube - "The Insiders": https://youtu.be/Ml-rxMwcaf0

2 hoursish - youtube - Austrian Mens Boulder Summer Series Final: https://youtu.be/Log_MlYyFPA

2 hoursish - youtube - Austrian Womens Boulder Summer Series Final: https://youtu.be/OIs-NrTcO5k

TL;DR - not being able to climb sucks. Climbing "vicariously" by watching others compete, climb big walls, or just crush insane projects, seems to help. Please add your favorite climbing video links below! 

Stay safe and strong out there.
When to hangboard When the gyms where closed, I started Hangboarding. Now that I can go bouldering again I want to climb at least three times per week but also want to do max hangs once or twice per week. My question is if it is best to Hangboard on non-climbing days or before/after climbing. What is your opinion on this?
The Meathook factor This may apply more to indoor climbing than outdoor climbing. 

There is a variety of bulbous holds used to set sloping problems in gyms. Often times on these problems the easiest beta revolves around hooking your hand and wrist around a hold in a meat hook fashion rather than actually pulling on the sloping part of the hold. This also happens outdoors on occasion, however significantly more rare(typically arete climbing).

My question is how do you believe this particular grip(or abusing this hold's shape) can influence training? Pro's? Cons? 



I thought about this for a little bit, and had some inner dialogue that i really appreciated. I wanted to pass on the topic to see if others have pondered this thought, and what their opinions are.


My verdict is that figuring out how to meat-hook the best you can is a great way to exercise new problem solving, IMO a very very important mental skill. however it may be detrimental to your endgame goal of mastering slopers and sending Dream Catcher in Squamish(don't kid yourself, I know you have thought about it).
Has anyone else lost like all their high intensity cardio since quarantine? Any ideas what to do about it? I can still run like 3-5 miles without to much hassle my time won’t be glorious or anything but I can do it, I also walk like 10 mile everyday. Anyway anyone have ideas on how to train cardio to the level needed for bouldering without climbing often, running hasn’t cut it?
Hangboard cheating When hanging, the further your centre of mass is, the easier the better the edge becomes.

So I find myself subconsciously pulling my torso as far forward as I can to make the hang easier. It makes me wonder whether my hangboard gains are coming from my forearms, or from my lats/shoulder/core instead..

You see photos of people hangboading in the front lever position, often from monos or tiny crimps, which again will make the edges way better.

So, is this a bad thing? This engages the shoulders, lats and core heavily. Making the exercise really a compound exercise. On a dead flat wall you won't be able to do this, but for steeper angles it becomes useful. I'm unsure whether to force myself to avoid doing this, or to not really worry about it.
What is something that a lot of people are doing to train or get better that is a waste of time? A lot of people have posted on this sub about a magic bullet that will make them way better at climbing. I think it’s just as interesting to think about the things people are doing in pursuit of climbing harder that are a waste of time. 

A good example of this for me would be “core with friends,” as kris Hampton calls it. Everybody does the same core workout, despite there being no way that everyone in the group needs the same stimulus to improve. It’s probably a waste of time for most of the people involved.

A less helpful example would be working on your strengths too much. Obviously the guy who can one arm hang on a 20 mm edge but can barely do two pull-ups should get off the hangboard and into the gym, but it’s not very fun to talk about.
Anyone have experience with trying hard at two sports? Hi, 

I'm very passionate about climbing and running. These days I'm training for a marathon, so I'm running around 60k a week, and that number is only going up (slowly). However, gyms just opened up where I'm from, so I'm super pumped about climbing a lot. 

General question: do many of you have other sports that you like to try hard at? If so, how does that affect your climbing training? How do you mix up your training, recovery, etc? I'm mainly looking for discussion from people with a similar background (i.e. want to climb really hard, but also want to do their best at other sports as well) 

Thanks
People who have greatly increased your hip mobility, what advice can you give? Hey all, I should have been doing this all quarantine but better late than never. I want to finally commit to daily stretching, specifically hip mobility. I've found some good information on here but would love to hear from people who have made noticable advancements in their mobility and what worked best. General advice is welcome too of course. I'm curious of any must do stretches, and how often. Is it possible to over stretch as long as there isn't pain?

I was just in Leavenworth and got shutdown by a v4 I knew I was strong enough to do. The problem is the first move is a heel hook hand match from the sit start. I was physically unable to move my leg in that position, my leg would just hit a brick wall. My buddies who are much taller than me were able to do this cramped move easily. This problem will create a great baseline to track my progress. Now I just have to get there with my horrendously tight hips, and consistently stretch.
Improving One Arm Lockoff Height (Chest to Bar) It seems like increasing maximum lock off height would be really useful for for big pull through type moves (like 1-5-9 on a campus board). Right now I can one arm lock off on a bar with the bar just below chin height, but it would be great if I could lock off such that the bar was at chest height. Another way to think about this is improving the max height of a one arm pullup. One issue is that this position seems to be bad for the elbows/tendons which might make it dangerous to train. Also, is one arm chest to bar achievable/worthwhile? I don't know of any elite climbers which can do this, but it wouldn't suprise me if some could.

How should this be trained? Some ideas I had:

* Work on improving maximum lock off time in a chin above bar lockoff. I don't think this will be sufficient because I can already hold this position for a while.
* Same as above, but increase weight instead of time.
* Assisted one arm pullup negatives starting bar to chest and just doing the top part of the motion.
* With added weight, train bar to chest 2 arm lockoffs.

For reference, I can one arm lock off with chin above bar for about 15 seconds and I can do 4-6 one arm pullups per side (I don't think improving either of these will translate directly to improve my maximum lock off height). Also, I realize this is less important than a lot of other types of training.
Thoughts on Optimal Weight/BMI I’ve seen other posts related to this topic, but could use some advice or wisdom!  
I’ve been trying to lose weight to get into a more lean, compact shape for bouldering hard.  Last season I hovered around 160 lbs.  I realized I could easily shave off some pounds by dieting and doing some cardio during quarantine.  I’ve gone down to about 154 lbs. I am 5’ 8” for reference.  
I definitely feel better on crimps and limit boulders at a slightly lower weight.  
My question is, at what point should one stop focusing on leaning out and more on technique/overall strength. 
I try to focus on those aspects of my climbing even more than leaning out, but I can’t ignore the fact that most people who climb “hard” have a BMI of closer to 19-20. I’m sitting around 23.  Any advice on methods of leaning out would be welcome! I don’t want to be at such a caloric deficit that I can’t train properly but also want to continue losing weight to see performance gains.
Swollen joints Any one else, waking up each morning with swollen and hurting finger joints? It started since i moved up in grades (8a) and need to hold tiny crimps. It doesn't hurt when climbing, only when the fingers are "cold", which makes it hard for me to take a long break.

What is your approach? Who do you treat it?
What age did you start training? Just thought i put this out there, Just curious about what age people started training and whether they think they should have started earlier or later.
How do you tell if you lack strength or technique for certain moves? I'm predominantly a boulderer and have been climbing for six years. Sometimes there are moves I don't get the first time because I had the wrong body positioning or not enough tension, but there are always specific types of moves I struggle with, namely these:

- Sit start overhang boulder with a big first move and only one foothold. Usually I struggle when the next hold is beyond my lockoff point and it requires power from a sit start position.
- Campusing. Any variation of it.
- Mantling
- Double gaston to a big throw
- Holding slopers on overhangs

Is there a running theme in these types of moves? Eg. Shoulder strength, core strength etc..

Keen to get any advice or exercises to improve!

Edit: I climb around v5-6. I haven't trained at all or taken climbing too seriously so please don't expect that number of years climbing is equal to competency. I want to start training hence this post :)
How to build a Mini MoonBoard for Beginners I just submitted the first video for a two part series going over my experiences in great detail with building a freestanding Mini MoonBoard in my living room. The part 2 video is exporting now and will be uploaded shortly if anyone is interested. Hope it helps someone else stuck at home!

Here's a link:

I spent 6 months hangboarding and didn't jump up multiple grades. And that's absolutely fine. I injured my ankle at the start of the year, so had already switched to strength-training only before lockdown hit. Once it did, I found it really hard, and didn't really manage to keep up much training (especialy as my ankle is still bad, so I've had limited opportunity to cross-train even to keep general fitness up).

By the second month of lockdown, other than no-hang training, I was doing almost no exercise.

Today, gyms opened again in the UK. I went, wore a mask, and climbed a bunch of easy things before my skin exploded. My fingers felt good, everything else felt like utter trash, especially my footwork.

It was great fun. I'm psyched to be climbing again, and I know lots of things will come back quickly. 

I think from reading some of the posts on here I was secretly expecting to come back and discover that I had become Aiden Roberts. I am still not Aiden Roberts, but 'm really happy. Hopefully this helps one or two others moderate their expectations but end up feeling great about being able to climb again :).
If you're heading outside for a sweaty summer climbing day, don't forget electrolytes Made this mistake again yesterday. Why do I always forget?

After my 2 warmups, was pouring sweat and had no pulling power afterwards. It was exceptionally hot, around 85 in the shade with high humidity and I didn't stop sweating all day. Despite drinking 5L of water, came home feeling pretty dehydrated. 

You need lots of water on days like this, but also you need electrolytes and salts.
Tips for topping out Hi all! I have been going outdoors recently and either bailing at the top of a problem or completely avoiding the problem itself because of the top out. I have a huge fear of falling backwards and am quite risk-adverse because of my fear of heights (it has gotten worse since I haven't been climbing indoors). It's not so bad on low balls.

Some of the problems I've been working on don't offer much at the top except for maybe a few slopers at the edge, which aren't always ideal when I start sweating from both fear and weather conditions.

Would appreciate any tips, cues, and/or resources to help with top out technique so I can finally send some of these problems and build the confidence to approach others.

Thanks in advance!!
Live on a tiny pacific island with no rock climbing anywhere close. Is a moonboard the solution? I have absolutely zero options to practice climbing right now due to where I live. Before I moved here I was hitting v4's and occasional v5s at my gym, but that was 6 months ago with no practice in between. Im desperate to start climbing again and am thinking of building a moonboard. what do ya'll think? Have any other suggestions? I could just build a regular wall and set my own routes, but I like the idea of having hundreds of different routes in one space.
What is the biggest difference in technique between someone that climbs in the V3-5 range and someone that climbs V8+ I would like to begin by apologizing for only using bouldering terms, I’m not familiar enough with toproping to ask this kind of question. I know V5 to V8 is a huge difference but I just want to get it across. 

I’ve been climbing for about two years and have been taking it pretty seriously. I mostly keep to the wall in terms of training but I try hard to push myself and have improved at a rate I’m happy with, climbing now at a pretty consistent V4/V5 level. I’m beginning to talk more with the gym elders about technique, finding better footwork, etc. but I would really appreciate if some of you wall messiahs could isolate some of the big differences between someone who climbs at an advanced level and my own. 

Thank y’all very much and have a wonderful weekend!

05/09/2020: Grade breakthrough today! Lots of amazing advice in this thread.
Interesting phenomenon - indoors vs outdoors As the lockdown happened, I started climbing outdoors a lot more (restrictions ended much earlier here in Quebec) and climbing in grades in sport(and bouldering) climbing. Interestingly enough, my indoors grades  (bouldering) dropped a bit.  Has anyone experienced that before?

Edit : worth mentioning that the fire isn't there as much when I'm indoors, might maybe explain something?
Amateur results for pull-up survey on /r/climbharder **Preface**
----
I did my best to interpret the results, but I'm no statistician. The graphs linked had basic parsing done like removing outliers (shoutout to the guy who says he can do 75 pullups).

* [Link to view graphs](https://imgur.com/a/drIdERE)
* [Link to view all responses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g9LqDn7fkHiizblC4Hu3YQb9xPH0VEYEgm_LNf5u4tE/edit?usp=sharing)

**Post**
----

A couple months back I posted a survey here asking for responses on your maximum number of pullups compared to your highest grade bouldered / sport climbed. I finally got around to looking at the data and figured I'd share here for anyone interested.

* **Hypothesis**: Your maximum pullups does not correlate to your maximum grade bouldered
* **Findings**:
  * _Men_: Responses showed little to no correlation between maximal pullup reps and highest bouldering/sport grade. 

       One possible explanation for this is that, generally speaking, men have a greater propensity towards strength sports and thus will enter the sport with a much wider range of muscular abilities than women. As a result, pullup strength is likely less of a factor in improved performance over other skill-based facets like technique/flexibility/mindset/etc.
 * _Women_: Responses **did** show a small correlation between maximal pullup reps and highest bouldering/sport grade.

      This might suggest that there is a correlation between women who perform sport-specific strength training (like pullups) and their highest climbing grade. Unlike the respones from men, women at the entry-level grades shared a consistent level of maximal pullups. As you look at higher grades, the max pullups repititions for women slowly increase (thus the correlation with strength training to some degree).

**TL;DR:** Responses from female climbers showed a small correlation between max pullups &amp; max bouldering grade, but after 5+ pullups the correlation dramatically drops to nearly insignificant. Take away is that the initial correlation may be related to general strength training rather than pullups in general.

Thoughts?
Short survey regarding climbing experience Hi all,

I'm looking for responses on the correlation between experience/training and climbing (bouldering) capabilities for a school project. If you had some spare time to complete the short survey it'd be very much appreciated!

[https://forms.gle/AAqebRKwGagwXnjU7](https://forms.gle/AAqebRKwGagwXnjU7)

It's 5 multiple choice questions that should take &lt;30 seconds. I understand that the values won't mean much at the end of the day but it'll at least be interesting to work with

EDIT:  Please complete the survey with regards to your pre-covid climbing habits.

End-of-training core work that isn't a waste of time or unnecessary volume &amp; '6 minute abs' During quarantine I was doing something that people would call '6 minute abs' although mine was closer to 8. I was doing this for a reason - without climbing volume, I wanted to keep my core conditioned to hold tension for minutes at a time.

But since I'm starting to climb a few times a week, I'm wondering if this is still necessary? Also I've heard many people in the climbing community say that the '6 minute abs' forma is a waste of time. What do people think of this? am I just wasting my time by continuing to train like this?

Finally, If my goal is to increase my ability to hold tension on steep overhangs, what exercises/formats do you think is the best use of the last 15 or so minutes of my gym slot?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: After 1 week of getting back into the gym, I'm realizing that I really don't think I need to finish with abs every day given I've done enough hard climbing. I think I might turn this ab burnout down to once a week.
You sent your first route/problem of a new grade. Now what? I’m closing in on finishing a problem of a new higher grade. Of you all who are climbing/bouldering at the higher end of things, how did you approach training after reaching new highs, in order to keep progressing? I feel like a lot of training concepts/programs don’t exactly touch on this very well. I know how a whole climbing career can/should look, but not quite how to approach small points like this
What is the best city coastal with good climbing near by? I’m an mechanical engineer and my two loves are surfing and climbing so I want to move somewhere that will help me get better at those, especially climbing, anyone have suggestions?
Commercially available freestanding climbing home wall options? With the covid pandemic there has been a boom in home walls. Some companies have been capitalizing on this. I imagine the vast majority of people on here would recommend building your own DIY wall for a far cheaper price, but let's put those opinions aside if we can.

My question is, what are the current commercially available freestanding climbing wall options? Here is what I have seen so far (prices below do NOT include holds or padding) listed by price point (cheapest to most expensive)

1. BrewerFitness Boulderboard 4 vs. 6 (4x10 vs. 6x10 at 17-40 degrees) - $1150 vs. $1550 ([https://brewerfitness.com/product/boulderboard6-2/](https://brewerfitness.com/product/boulderboard6-2/))
2. PowerStation/Dave Macleod 2020 including powerstation/climbing wall/kick board/hangboard/pullup bar- \~$1185 ([https://powerstationtraining.com/collections/build-your-power-station](https://powerstationtraining.com/collections/build-your-power-station))
3. Rockstar Volumes Rocket Wall (8x7 at 30 degrees) - $1400 ([https://www.rockstarvolumes.com/product-page/rocket-wall](https://www.rockstarvolumes.com/product-page/rocket-wall))
4. PowerStation/Dave Macleod Pro Standard (can be configured with Mini Moonboard setup) - \~2935 ([https://powerstationtraining.com/collections/power-station-pro](https://powerstationtraining.com/collections/power-station-pro))
5. Grasshopper Climbing Ninja wall (7x10 with adjustable angle)  - $5500 ([https://grasshopperclimbing.com/collections/frontpage/products/grasshopper-ninja-adjustable-climbing-wall](https://grasshopperclimbing.com/collections/frontpage/products/grasshopper-ninja-adjustable-climbing-wall))
6. Freestanding Moonboard (this one DOES include holds) -$10375 ([https://moonclimbing.com/freestanding-moonboard-climbing-wall.html](https://moonclimbing.com/freestanding-moonboard-climbing-wall.html))

Any one know of any other options?

\*Edit: adding suggestions from below to my post
Quarantine killed my psych Not really sure if this belongs here. Been climbing for almost 15 years, and it's obviously been a huge part of my life and my identity. All my time not working 9-5 is at the gym or on trips. All my friends are climbers. It's all I think about or want to think about.

At least, that was pre-quarantine. Not climbing for 4 months, not going outside, not going to the gym - it's killed my psych. I felt no desire to climb during isolation, and now that I can go back to the gym, it's not the same. I'm not excited to climb. The drive isn't there anymore. It doesn't help that a lot of my close friends have not returned.

It's not that I'm frustrated at lost progress- I actually feel pretty good physically.  And I've been out much longer for injuries before. I'm just struggling with the loss of passion for something I thought was my whole life for so long. I'm trying to pick up another hobby, but it's not the same... because climbing was never really a hobby, ya know?

Not sure why I'm posting this. Maybe someone has gone through the same midlife climbing crisis and can advise.

edit: posted this while feeling particularly down yesterday and truly didn't expect much of a response. Thanks to everyone. Here's to taking it day by day, letting go, and staying hopeful.
Hey all! I've created a new subreddit called /r/climbingbuilds meant to host any content related to DIY / other climbing build topics. Check it out and let me know what you think! As the title says,

I've messaged the moderators to make sure this was appropriate to post here.

There's some great information in the sidebar of the new subreddit (/r/climbingbuilds) with some guidance and rules.

We're going to be very lenient to start out in order to get a nice community going, so if you have any feedback or suggestions I'll take them to heart.

At a glance, some topics might include discussion / pictures / video on things such as DIY walls, holds, hang-boards, and possibly advice and guides or links to current climbing build gear sales.

Thanks for taking a look!
Advice for a beginner moon boarder I’ve been bouldering for just over a year and am pretty solid on the V5-V7 range indoors (I’m only just starting out outdoors, but j want to improve there too) and I’m thinking of utilizing a moon board as a finger strength trainer. I currently have a hangboard and I want to use both (on different days of course). As someone who is new to moon boarding, how often should this be done and for how long? Just trying to improve my finger strength as much as possible while not getting injured.
How can I improve my precision? My aim is literally laughable I'm talking about placing my hands and feet when under tension (indoor bouldering). I will aim for a two-finger pocket, then whack the wall next to it and fall off
Fear of leading after poor belay experience Its been a few weeks since this happened but I'm starting to think it's related. When I started sport leading I was fearless because i only did routes i was confident in,  and slowly i rose my grade and did a roof and started committing to moves maybe I wasn't strong enough for.  I've always been afraid of the possibility of lead falling but after one experience where my belayer lost control after taking at the anchor, he caught me like a foot or two above the ground,  I laughed it off because in the end I didn't get hurt.  But I think I've been carrying that since and I've really been freezing up and getting pumped on what should be a warmup for me (on lead).
My top roping is unaffected the grade there is still making slow progress but I'm noticing now among my peers who I have been equal with until recently I'm not keeping pace on lead. What do you have to say? 

I started reading vertical minds yesterday btw.
I need help learning how to climb at my limit and not get injured I boulder V5-6 and I've been trying to push it harder for quite a while. However, it feels like whenever I try to go harder on the wall, I end up having a minor injury. It's always like going 2 steps forward, one step back. A couple pulleys have been tweaking lately. Not full tears or anything, but bad enough that I will feel them on 20mm and I feel small pains (not actually painful, I can just tell it's tweaked) when I press on the fingers.

For example, it feels like I can't have a single board session without worrying about injuring my fingers. I'm not sure if I'm just bad at climbing hard but I really really want to climb as hard as I can. I feel much less likely to injure myself if I just hangboard or something, but my technique is pretty bad and I know I need to work on it on hard problems. Any advice, or those that are in similar situations?
What people want in a hangboard Hi r/climbharder

I am currently doing my DT GCSE and for my project i am going to make a hang board. I was just wanting to know what features/hold types people like in a hang board. anything is welcome!

Thanks
Sent my long term project called dugout v7-. I notice everytime I topout it takes a long time. I’m not sure if I’m still using my legs as much as possible as well. What do y’all think I can improve on with my technique?
The Answer To Every "When/What/How To Train" Question. I've lurked this sub for a long time and rarely posted because of how cyclic the questions and commentary tend to be. I think we can eliminate most questions and help most climbers with this simple thought process.

Technique is not just the names of moves or ease of difficulty of a specific type of move. It is not a thing with a measurable threshold, level, or point of mastery. You never stop working on it. Simply put, I feel technique is the ability to use proprioception, body/box positioning, and the use of various types of energy (potential, kinetic, etc) to complete a move with the lowest amount of energy expenditure possible. You could quantify energy expenditure per move or across many moves. That's it. When comp climbers do crazy parkour moves and dyno into toe hooks, they are controlling a swing and using less energy. Or Janja does her kick to reduce force/transfer energy elsewhere in her body.

In almost every "critique my climb video" or lower grade/experience climber you hear "I can't do the X move" i.e. "I can't do the deadpoint from the crimp to the sloper" or "I have weak whatever so I can't X".

You are ready to train a specific strength once you can do the following on I would argue some arbitrarily high percentage of moves:

1a. Once you come off you can immediately recall where every part of your body was in space or:

1b. Use video to accurately be able to:

2. To say something like: "My left foot was backflagged and toe was an inch from the rock, which allowed me to pull my right arm deeper into a lockoff and rockover onto my left foot where my knee was angled out and I was internally rotating so as to drive with my inner edge on the most incut part of the foot. Once I reached optimal lockoff and counterweight I could remove my left hand, which was no holding little weight, to deadpoint to the sloper. After the deadpoint I pull my body a tad closer to the rock so that my left shoulder was behind the plumb line of the sloper thus reducing the amount of contact strength needed, which also allows me to adjust my grip if need be and move into the next move of the sequence from the optimal position.

3. If you didn't complete the move you must be able to identify at minimum one adjustment you have control to make, implement, and iterate.

The answer to every training question is: "Can I do this for every move, actively make changes, and be able to compare". If "yes" and you still can't do it and you've checked off basics such as temps, strategy, energy levels, skin, etc., then think about training. When you look at most good climbers that waited years to train or heed the "just climb" advice this is what you are building subconsciously. The other day someone posted a video and hadn't identified that they needed to open their hip as their knee was in the way. This is something I would consider a great example. One should be able to do this in real time and, bonus points, be able to identify which iteration was the optimal for both the move and problem.

Does this mean you can not do anything off a wall? No, just that you are unlikely to get as high of an ROI from an applied standpoint. It's always a sliding scale, but the longer you milk this process, the more direct ROI you can get. Forgoing some arbitrary amount of training (let's say T-N) allows you to go through this cycle faster and faster. Your training will be better informed when, in the example above, you can firmly say that you can't hold the right hand lockoff needed in sequence to use the most optimal beta and might need more shoulder or back strength. 

Hope this helps!
How to tackle the struggles of climbing as a vision impaired climber I was wondering how many people climb with the same struggles as I do (vision impairment) in this subreddit and how you are able to climb as well as others. I would love to see if a community of vision impaired climbers exist! Would love to hear about your struggles regarding climbing/training and how you manage to tackle them. Perhaps some things that you find very difficult compared to other climbers. 

Sincerely, A one eyed climber.
Climbing changed my life [clickbait off]. Lost 25+ kg, progressed far beyond my wildest hopes and expectations. [Long post with progress pictures and videos] Hi y'all!

Progress pictures and some video of me climbing, along with a TLDR, will follow at the bottom!

Also, to start, I know that everything below is max a V0 in your gym. Not a problem - I'll take a V0! :)

Thought I'd share my story / journey up to this point, and **also present my plan going forward where I hope for some critique and insight on how to improve it.**

First thing's first, my background. Between \~2011-2014 I was working out regularly on a gym with some kind of bodybuilding / powerlifting hybrid. I then met my now wife, and stopped working out, focusing on other aspects of my life. At most I've weighed 107kgs when I was working out (185cm), and about 105kg when not working out (aka fat). I haven't really suffered too much though as I've had a fairly strong body as a base due to my workout history so never had problems with pains or injuries etc.

Fast forward to this year. I weighed in this year a little over 185cm/97kg (or 6'1"/214lbs). I didn't have a strict plan to lose weight or anything, but I just started eating less junk. Didn't do too much to the weight, lost about 3kg between december and middle of february.

Enough of the boring stuff - cue the climbing!!

The first time I ever set foot in a climbing gym was February 20. Long story short - I instantly got hooked. Purchased my first pair of shoes (Scarpa Origin) a week or two later, and the train was moving! I'm very much of a "all or nothing" kind of person, so this also sparked a fairly extreme weight loss journey as I early understood that it's the quickest way for me to get better at climbing. To not go too much into the dieting part, I utilized the knowledge I got while bodybuilding and averaged between 1200-2200 kcal daily deficit for a couple of months which worked wonders on the weight. I have tracked the weight loss sporadically, and a chart can be found here if anyone's interested:

**97,5kg/215lbs** \- 2020-01-01 - Start  
**89,3kg/196,9lbs** \- 2020-03-11 - (three weeks after I started climbing)  
**85,5kg/188,5lbs** \- 2020-03-31  
**78,8kg/173,7lbs** \- 2020-04-30 - Here the weight loss (obviously) stagnated, as I haven't got too much fat left to lose. I also increased my caloric intake a bit since I wanted to climb harder.  
**75,8kg/167,1lbs** \- 2020-05-28  
**73,0kg/160,9lbs** \- 2020-06-20  
**70,2kg/154,8lbs** \- 2020-08-15 - Not a completely fair result as I weighed in afternoon, and it was extremely hot this day and I hadn't had enough to drink. Probably about 71,5kg is the correct result.

Earlier this week I also took a "body analysis" which is a fancy way to say that I stood on a TANITA scale which kind of measured my body composition. I don't think this is too accurate, but at least it's an indication and it's fun to have! I just wish I had done one before I started losing weight. Will do more in the future as well to have something to compare.

Note that this was done while wearing clothes at 09:56 which is why the weight is 73,5 - but for the calculations I was told that the extra weight was deducted.

But when will he get to the freaking climbing?!

Right now! As I said, I got instantly hooked on climbing and it's been a wonderful ride ever since. I started out toproping, but when COVID hit I was forced to start bouldering instead which has been amazing as well. I'm looking forward to starting toproping again in a few months though!

When I started out as the fatso above and never having climbed before, needless to say I was struggling on EVERYTHING. Just holding onto anything that wasn't a pure jug was almost impossible. But I kept at it, and at the rate that I was losing weight everything became substantially easier (obviously).

This is the first video I have of myself bouldering. It was taken on March 7. I look at it with a big smile. At least I tried!

[https://streamable.com/ugnecl](https://streamable.com/ugnecl)

My technique gradually became better (but still crap), even though I was really weak (which is extremely obvious on the second video). Both these clips were taken March 31.

\[Disclaimer: I've removed all the grades and simply called them A, B,C etc where the higher the letter, the harder the grade\]

Fast forward a month to April 30. By then I was doing a bunch of **A** / **B** ( and had my eyes set on my first **C**. There were several problems that were a lot easier (including a **D** that I had sent a week or so before this, but it was so soft that I didn't count it as anything above a **A**) but I really, really, really wanted this one to be my first send of a **C**. I think I did about 70 or 80 attempts on this problem over the span of five sessions or so and it was the first contact I had with heel hooks among with other things. It was simply WAY harder than anything I'd ever tried before. But I'm stubborn. The following clip is maybe 40 tries in or so, when I can manage the start and get to the crux (which is the heel hook on the volume, which sucks). At least I'm making progress!

[https://streamable.com/cirruo](https://streamable.com/cirruo)

But I kept at it, and did it over and over and over again. On May 8 I FINALLY made the crux, it was a big moment! Unfortunately I didn't keep my focus and slipped off in a super stupid way. The second time I made the crux, two days later,  I sent it. Unfortunately I didn't catch that on film, but I got the first attempt on video.

[https://streamable.com/5srw05](https://streamable.com/5srw05)

When I managed to send my first **C** everything kind of began to click. I felt so much stronger every session, I could do things my brain said "no way!" about. It was awesome. So I got injured. It was not a big deal, I tried a **C** with lots of finger pockets for an hour, ignoring that my hand started feeling off. I constantly have to remind myself that my tendons etc in my hands are not built up to manage everything I can throw at it and this time I had to pay for it. Fortunately it didn't require anything more than rest and some medicine, but it forced me off climbing for a month. It. Sucked. I was really afraid that I would lose all the gains I had gathered recently, but I didn't have to worry. Shortly after I came back (July 26 to be precise) I sent my first **D** (ignoring the first soft one). I don't have a video of it, but I did it really well (and I estimate that I saw only one in thirty people or so who was trying it could send it). It felt awesome to get back.

I felt like everything started having a snow ball effect, and the better I did, the more I could push myself. My technique got SO much better in a short period of time, and I could flash most **A** and **B** that I tried. At this rate I just enjoyed climbing so damn much, and I started exploring different techniques that I never "had" to use and therefor hadn't practiced as much as I probably should (such as the kneebar below):

[https://streamable.com/61cq7n](https://streamable.com/61cq7n)

It was around this time that I started looking seriously at a **E**. I think most people agree with me that there's a mental barrier at certain milestones. This was one for me. In my head it should be SO much above my ability that it was foolish to even consider trying it, but I did. I felt some holds on different problems for a while, never really taking the plunge to comitting for an actualy attempt. But then one day I found a problem that REALLY seemed to fit my style and I went for it. As with the first **C** I started projecting, it was way too hard to begin with. But as I said before - I'm freaking stubborn, and I kept at it, and kept at it, and kept at it. It didn't take as many tries as the blue nemesis of the past, but it still took quite a bit of work. But then, at last, August 1, six days after I sent my first **D**, 163 days or 5 months after I first started climbing, I topped it. I didn't expect to do it that day, but everything just clicked. Video below:

[https://streamable.com/50h3j0](https://streamable.com/50h3j0)

It felt surreal. This was a magic moment and milestone for me. When I first started climbing I never thought I'd EVER climb a **E**, during my entire life. It felt that far away. I got so high on life, and the climbing just got better and better. Five days later I sent my second **E.** I approached it with a lot more self confidence, and it was such a difference to get on it. It also fit my style really well, so I both got on and off it with a big smile!

[https://streamable.com/gg60hs](https://streamable.com/gg60hs)

Next step, **F**. My plan had been to slow things down a bit with progression as the holds are getting so much worse at this level compared to 6C, and I'm a bit afraid that my hands will get completely destroyed a session soon. But, during a session last week I found a **F** that looked so perfect for me that I HAD to try it out. It starts with a crimp campus move to another crimp on volume, match hands and get foot up on the wall, a big move to a pretty good undercling with the right hand, a decent crimpish undercling with the left, two "okay" feet, crappy pinch on volume to a crappy sloper. The reason I'm explaining this is that I do not have a video showing the entire problem. But yesterday I managed to send it. Against all freaking odds. It took two sessions working on it, then I sent it. My friend just started filming half way through since neither of us thought I had it in me.

[https://streamable.com/38d654](https://streamable.com/38d654)

I finished that session with sending a new **D** as well. WHAT A FREAKING SESSION! It's exactly on the date six months from when I first set my foot in a climbing gym. Not in a MILLION YEARS I would have thought that I'd be where I am today when I started out. Not only the weight loss and getting myself into a fairly good shape (imo), but to have done such progress with my climbing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So there's the history of my weight loss and climbing to date. I'm now trying to plan for the future. My goals have constantly been increased pushed further and further ahead.

First, when it comes to physical challenges I would like to do the following in six months:

20x pullups (I can do about 13-14 today)  
1x one arm pullup on both arms  
10x pistol squats on each leg (I can do about 5 today)  
Being able to hang in a pull up position with my chin above the bar for at least 70 seconds (I can do 50 today)

When it comes to climbing I would like to send a V6 outside next season, which I think won't be too much of a problem with one more year's worth of climbing. After that I honestly have no idea or no expectations on what I can be able to achieve. I want to start lead climbing outside as well, and take some climbing trips in Europe and Yosemite (but that's in a couple of years time). I think every climber shares the same kind of goals here.

I am however a bit unsure on how to proceed with my climbing. Up until this point I've only done climbing - I have had 0 "gym sessions" doing pullups, campus climbing or fingerboarding and it has seemed to work. I have actively been avoiding fingerboarding since I have seen it as an increased finger injury risk, but I might actually be at the point where it's a larger risk NOT to start training my fingers? Also, should I focus on just getting maximal time on the wall (I climb between 10-15 hours a week at the moment) or should I change it up and spend one of three days in the gym rather than on the wall?

Is there any other kind of training that I should start looking into at the level I'm currently at? Or anything that you can see in my climbing technique that sucks or that I should focus more on? I realize that it's not too much material and a bunch of it is it old, but all kind of information is good information! :)

If there's someone who actually read through all of this: THANK YOU! And thanks for the entire climbing community. Without you it wouldn't be half as fun climbing, and I would still be a fatso.

**TLDR: Weighed almost 100kg (220lbs), lost almost 30kgs (66lbs), sent my first F yesterday (V1 in your gym) all in six months and am so happy to have climbing in my life.**

EDIT: Removed the grades put up by my gym and simply labeled them A-B-C... etc!
I've plateaued on V5 for a whole year, what do I do? I'll start with some background. I've been climbing for 1.5 yeads, and for the past year I've been stuck on V5. I've become extremely close to climbing V6 before, but end up becoming too psyched and injuring myself from climbing too much. But now I've learnt from my mistakes, I'm confident it shall not happen again, I've become increasingly better at listening to my body. I should also mention I'm pretty close to climbing a V6 outdoors, I can currently do it in 2 half's.

So the first obvious answer is to train. But I'm overwhelmed by that whole idea. I've done tons of research online, and lurked this subreddit for long enough, but still, I can't get my head around the whole idea.

Let me explain more in depth why the whole idea of training overwhelmes me. So the first thing is how to structure it all. For me it seems like an extremely daunting task. How much should I climb? When should I do certain exercises? How much rest should I get? What exercises do I do? Do I train before, or after a climbing session? What climbing drills should I use? Should I use climbing drills? 

So yeah, there's a lot going through my head and I feel lost. What should I do?
Need advice... Who here took climbing too seriously and ruined it for themselves? So I understand this likely applies to just about anything.  But in a climbing context it is very easy to focus on the wrong thing.  I am definitely guilty of this.

The main issue at hand is that the difficulty in climbing is so measured.  When you ride mountain bikes say, you cruise down the hill with your mates and its all good.  There is no timer.  It's just fun.

With climbing I feel it is sometimes impossible for me to not obsess about the grade.  "Well if I can climb that 5.12, why the fuck can't I climb this 5.10, this is so fucked, I'm pathetic, fuck this, climbing is for losers, I wanna quit."

This actually happened tonight.  I am trying to work out why I'm such an asshole.  Is it just that?  I have a fucked up ego problem?

I dunno.  It's a few hours later and I can laugh at myself a little now.  But why the fuck do I feel so emotional when I get shut down on a climb?  Does anyone else go through this?  Does anyone have any advice?  I just want to enjoy this shit and not get so pissed at myself.

If it's just that I'm an asshole then I understand.  Let me know.
How do you structure your volume sessions? Recently started to implement volume sessions to my training, as I feel technique is the limiting factor to me progressing further.

My plan was to start by climbing the entire V0 circuit, and working my way up the circuits up to V3. During each climb I would focus of having the best technique and beta possible. If a move felt like it could be done better, or more efficiently, I would do it.

As far as the session went, I finished the V0 and the V0-1 circuit in their entirety, and only a few from the V1-2 circuit in the span of 2 hours. This came to roughly a total of 20 climbs. 

So here are the questions I have regarding volume sessions:

1. In my next volume session, should I start at the V0 again and work my way up, or finish on the V1-2 circuit instead?

2. Should I be tracking my volume sessions? Logging down the climbs I completed etc.

3. How many volume sessions should I have a week? Current plan is 2 volume sessions and one limit bouldering session.

I can provide any more information if required. Any information/advice which is given is highly appreciated.
What sports do you cross train in and what benefits do you receive? I’ve been bouldering for a little shy of 2 years and before that I never really had a sport that I was this passionate about. I’d like to try other sports as a way to have fun, get stronger and more fit in a way that translates into becoming a more well rounded climber. I ride my bike here and there but would love to get involved in some team sports when Covid is over. I’m curious what you guys do on the side and if climbing is your main focus!
Retrospective Forced First Hangboard Cycles for V10/+ "Non-Hangboarder" **Background:** I am often a voice talking about not needing to hangboard until Vdoubledigit for many folks (coached/pro climbers are  an exception). As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, I got my first hangboard setup and did almost nothing but Crimpd 2-arm max hangs on a 20mm edge, every other day, for two months. Before this happened I'd been slowly coming around to the idea that a hangboard cycle would be good for me at this point, but I was still skeptical I would take the step (I prefer to climb).

This is my retrospective on the experience, with data (no graphs, but if anyone wants to make 'em, I'll supply the data). From early March until end of August I had zero days in the gym (it was closed, then I was gone).

**TLDR Nutshell Conclusions:** I certainly increased my hangs, from 124% of bodyweight to 165% BW. My half crimp on rock subjectively got stronger-- and more fatigue-proof (power endurance; could keep my hand closed for longer). After returning to rock, I felt stronger. It's hard to total separate how much of that is just my own baseline progression that would have continued without hangboarding, and how much is due to the hangboarding itself.

**Personal Interpretation:** I think I owe some excess progress beyond my baseline progress rate to the hangboard. I think it's an appropriate time for me to introduce a hangboard, and I plan to continue incorporating it into my workout on a weekly basis. I'm confident I could climb V12 without ever touching one, but also confident that I can climb V12 faster/easier by incorporating it now.

**Stats:**

Age: Late 30s

Height/weight: 176cm (zero ape index), 64kg (±2kg)

Bouldering: \~6 years

Grade: Up to V11 outside before and after the hangboard cycle

Previous training: Essentially zero off-wall/non-just-bouldering training. Access to great gyms, and great crags. I've climbed 3-4 times a week for 2-3 hours at Vflash to Vflash+2 (in the gym that means V6-8). Virtually no moonboard. I probably get outside 1/3 to 1/2 of all weekends, and have 1 or 2 trips of 7-10 days (usually Font), and in 2019 4.5 weeks in Rocklands and 2020 6 weeks roadtripping.

**Protocol and Log**

Max Hang (10s, 20mm, two arms, 2 minute rest x 6). I did almost nothing else. A few bike rides. A few weighted pull workouts, a few pistol squats... by mid-april I gave up on everything but max hangs.

Bodyweight actually went from around 66 at the start to 62 in the very last workouts. I tend to lose weight if I am not actively working out (gym climbing) or active. I haven't weighed myself since June or so.

From June 27th until August 20, roughly, I was on a roadtrip with a lot of bouldering at a combination of new and old to me crags.

**In the 12 months before starting hangboarding** (including 2 trips to Font, and over a month in Rocklands), my outdoor ticklist looks like: V6 x23, V7 x9, V8 x20, V9 x11, V10 x3, V11 x3.

**In the 5 months since starting hangboarding** (and having no time in the gym, and actually being outside only for around 2 months of actual climbing time), my outdoor ticklist looks like: V6 x15, V7 x6, V8 x9, V9 x5, V10 x4, V11 x2.

**Notes**

Note 0: I'm not hyper-grade focused, so when I go to a crag I tend to go with the flow about what I try and whom I'm with. I"m of course always on the lookout for "hard" stuff that I enjoy and suits me. But I've gone to places and climbed nothing but V6s for a week, or gone to a new crag for 3 weeks before even trying a V10 or V11 that I end up doing in a session or two. I basically don't project in the sense that I tend to climb most boulders in 2 sessions or less, except in the cases I keep punting... then I'll go back and give burns 3-5 sessions outside of trying other stuff for fun.

Note 1: The ticklist comparison under-represents my progress post hangboarding. Most of my roadtrip this year was in new places, where I never got settled enough to try that many hard boulders until the end. In the last week alone I left at least 3-5 V11s that were quickly sendable on the table for a variety of non-climbing-limited reasons (two each, almost in a session but too tired after doing all the moves/beta/links).

Note 2: I'd make a correction (unscientifically), and subjectively consider the post-hangboard period as something like 4 months of climbing when compared to the 12 months before hangboarding. In my head I multiply the post-HB period ticklist x2-3 to extrapolate.

Note 3: I had no endurance, and poor movement patterns when I first came back after the HB cycles. It took weeks to regain it. Not having any gym sessions has impaired my big muscle group workout/stamina/strength.

Note 4: After my first day back in the gym, end of August, I have had doms. My fingers feel strong. My body is pretty strong, but something is lacking even though I've been on physical, fingery boulders for the last 1.5 to 2 months. I doubt I've lost any finger strength since ending hangboarding mid-June because I get plenty of stimulus being on rock; I do think I've lost some kind of physical strength overall by not being in the gym (where there's a high volume of thuggy boulders) even though I've been outside. When I don't get outside enough I lose full-crimp on tiny holds power, the mental space of taking long enough rests, and precise footwork.

Note 5: I may have tweaked my A2 pulley on my non-dominant hand in the middle of my HB cycles. I don't know when it happened, but I recollect in the middle and end having some pain while warming up and upon squeezing the area. I still have it. Interestingly, I almost never feel it while hanging or climbing (full crimp/half crimp/open), even at full intensity, after I'm warm or after a session. Sometimes I bump it and it hurts. But other than that my fingers have felt very healthy. It's not a lumbrical. And I'm not a PT, nor have I seen one, so I can't really comment beyond that.

Note 6: To this day I found a bizarre phenomenon that as I warmed up, bodyweight and moderate weight hangs felt harder than expected-- and getting up to my training-weight tended to feel better/easier to a point. I almost need the stimulus of added weight to try hard enough... to lockdown and stay there. 

**More conclusions:**

\- Hangboarding definitely was a net-positive for me, but in a weird time when I couldn't get into the gym.

\- I plan to continue hangboarding. My goal is to do 1 or at maximum 2 sessions a week-- strictly max hangs. The second session may be one-armed. The rough plan is to do my max hang session before a gym session, and on that gym session focus on thuggier, slopey, Vflash to Vflash+2 boulders.

\- My position hasn't entirely changed. I doubt many people will benefit that much from hangboarding instead of climbing until at least V8-V10. Some people may need to start earlier, some may be able to start later, at up to V12 or higher. This is predicated on having access to enough wall/boulders to try hard (for you) up through moves at those grades. This could be a spray wall, set boulders, or a crag.

\- If you are coached/pro, disregard my story/advice. There's no question that for absolute fastest and deepest progression a hangboard is almost definitely going to be a central tool from relatively early on-- but absolute fastest/deepest progression by definition means truly pushing the border of safety/recovery to the point that one is taking on a consequential risk for a shot at glory (the kind of risk that might end or limit your climbing). I am risk averse, and particularly so without a coach. I've been a semi- to serious athlete in other areas earlier in my life, and the pattern was similar: Nobody is really equipped to self-coach at the absolute highest/fastest level. We all need external oversight, medical care, PT, and guidance on a fluid and ongoing basis if we're going to push the envelope into the risk zone for the last 5% of progress/speed at progress.

\- I don't see any reason to periodize-- for me. I still prefer climbing to anything else. I do this for fun. And I don't have hugely defined sending/non-sending parts of the year. I like to be ready to get on anything up to my limit at about any time... depending on my free time/weather/access.

\- Half crimp went from an absolute weakness for me- to on par or even at times a safety position for me. This deficit was directly addressed by hangboarding.

\- I'm glad I did this, and I hope I'll keep doing it. I'm convinced that this was the right time and the right thing to do.

EDIT: If anything interesting happens as I return to the gym, and then move through another year of climbing outside, and if anyone is interested, I'll post an update down the road.
Why do we tell people that climbing is 'all in your feet', when the vast majority of movements require at least some level of upper body?? I've struggled with this concept for the past 10 years of my climbing career to the point that I've confused whether the sentiment is false, or if I simply still don't understand how to 'use my feet'. It makes perfect sense that your feet are a pretty common foundation for generating power in climbing, but being able to 'push from your legs' just simply isn't feasible 100% of the time. I really, really try and have dedicated time to learning how to 'climb with my feet', but still can't seem to understand what this really means. It just seems to me that the old saying, "use your arms only for balance and support" is flat out wrong. Has anyone struggled with this before? How did you manage to resolve the issue?
Flat feet and bunions, afraid to get a more aggressive shoe, any advice? Hey all, was wondering if anyone else here has had trouble with flat feet and bunions in climbing. I'm wearing flat soft shoes atm but I wanted to get a more stiff aggressive shoe for learning overhangs now that I've improved. Anyone here have experience or knowledge of how to get around climbing with poorly structured feet? Or is the solution to just slowly build structure back into my foot via leg/foot exercises? Thanks in advance!
Mental game after unlucky accident I'm pretty new to climbing, as this has been the first season climbing outdoors consistently for me. And my weakest point is definitely my mental game. Still, I have been able to send a few 7b's and currently working on a 7c proj.

Anyway, this past week I finally 'felt' an improvement in my mental game --I went with some friends on a climbing trip and we were mostly checking out new crags and trying to do hard onsights or hopefully sending in one session. During the trip I was able to do my hardest flash and in a few routes I felt I was in the flow. On the last day of the trip I was feeling great trying this hard route for the first time; and then, in the middle of the crux, I grabbed an undercling that seemed completely solid (granite), but as I put all my body tension on it --BANG. A whole chunk of the rock came off.. and I'm talking about something of around 60cm/+20in long. The thing was probably over 20kg/+40lbs. I was in an overhanging position, but thankfully it didn't impact my head too badly (8 stitches on the forehead, no concussion), and most importantly it landed away from my belayer!
(Edit: both of us were wearing helmets)

Anyway, this happened 3 days ago and today I went to try out my project. I felt like shit. I was overgrabbing everything, hesitating on the harder clips, and of course doubting every undercling or any part of the rock that has fissures (although they have been there for many years and it is a classic route with lots of people going at it). I know it's all an irrational fear at this point, but it feels so bad to not be able to continue on that flow state that I was achieving lately. 

Has anybody experienced something like this? What worked or what do you think works the best to get back mentally? Should I start doing easier routes and gain confidence again or just try on harder routes hoping to overcome the irrational fear?

Thank you for your reading!!
The thrill is gone? Wasn't really sure where to put this thread, I just feel I need to share my thoughts. 

I have been struggling with a lack of motivation for climbing for almost a year now and maybe sharing my story can help.

I have always had a thing for outdoor sports and picked up climbing when I was 20 yo, almost 10 years ago. My first objective was always alpinism, and for the first few years I was mostly climbing in mountains (rock, snow, ice, mixed - also ski alpinism and an occasional solo) and did almost no sport climbing except a bit of gym once a week only to keep myself in condition, never for pure joy. In a couple of years I have reached a point where I was stuck at a certain level that was very hard (and even more dangerous) to surpass without proper sport climbing routine. When I reached a limit of how complex routes I can climb with my sport climbing niveau I started to feel a lack of motivation for climbing and therefore climbed much less. (admittedly it also had a lot to do with a girl that I was dating at the time). I felt good with things as they were at the time and didn't feel burdened with me not climbing so much as before.

After a hard breakup I filled the void with climbing again - a lot of climbing. I picked up sport climbing, found joy in training and a nice progress curve was giving me more and more motivation. It opened another world for me, since I could climb much harder rock routes also in the mountains (alpinism still remained my primary goal), enjoyed it more because I was more relaxed with a solid gap between my redpoint level and what I was climbing on trad in the mountains (this gap was virtually non-existent before). I did some climbing trips to different parts of the world, tried different rocks and climbing styles. I also became a part of elite climbing circles in the country and had the honor to climb with some of Europe's strongest climbers (still being far below their level though). 

Then all of a sudden, I didn't feel like training so much anymore so I took a bit of break, knowing (thinking) that I can come back into form rather quickly. The break lasted a few months and in this time I started to feel uncomfortable leading in sport climbing (I was always a bit afraid of falling, but with a lot of training consistency I can overcome this), leading to not wanting to go sport climbing even more and eventually leading to kind of an embarrassment of my level being so low that I didn't want to go at all. Winter came, and I focused on winter alpinism, where sport climbing level is not so important and I played on my experiences - with a bit of luck with conditions I pulled of some of the ascents I am the proudest of in my entire "career".  But from one ascent to another, I realized I don't enjoy the climbing so much anymore and my motivation is rather just "I have to go, I can't let those great conditions/nice Sunday go to waste". When spring came, I got myself in something of a rock climbing shape again with the mentality of "it has to be done, I can't not climb". 

Now I am kinda stuck here - I want to climb, and I want to enjoy climbing - but don't want to train and don't cope with the struggle of long approaches with a heavy backpack with ease as I used to. Almost every ascent I did this summer was like "ugh, why do I have to go" in the morning, "ugh, why didn't we chose a wall with shorter approach", "you lead the hardest pitch, I don't really feel like exposing too much" and so on. When the climb is completed I of course feel happy and accomplished and kinda want more, but the story repeats next time. I just don't enjoy the struggle parts of climbing anymore. To repeat, I also don't look forward to sport climbing - I kinda always just looked at cragging as a tool to get good for the mountains. I did enjoy sport climbing, but I think only because of the main goal - alpinism. 

I still fantasize about excitement before a hard route. I still dream of doing cool moves on the rock. I still remember the happiness of reaching the top of the wall/anchor/jug/a pice of good ice. Climbing is such a big part of my life a feel lost now that I apparently don't enjoy it anymore, but I just WANT to enjoy it.

Thank you for reading and for sharing your thoughts, maybe similar experiences, advice even.
Discussion: Mental Game To what degree do you find mental game (including fear, ego, ability to try hard, etc.) influences the success/failure of the climbers around you, including yourself? What mental issues do you see in other climbers that, if solved, would lead them to "climb harder"? Do you believe that mental game is given enough importance in the discussion of "climbing harder", especially in comparison to the relative importance that training and technique are given?

Examples and anecdotes encouraged.
How does it feel to be a lead climber with great endurance? I consider myself a lead climber, as 95% of my outside experience is sport climbing. Yet I train in bouldering gym mostly, thats fine, since most of the crags I visit offer rather short routes, and even longer routes usually have good rests, and just have some cruxy moves. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I decided to work on my endurance, and I visit a sport climbing gym, with overhanging routes about 20 meters long. Obviously all the moves on the routes feel super easy for me, but I just get pumped and take, or fall from what I would usually consider great holds. It's very disencouraging, to fall without doing any hard moves, I would even say, it does feel more like pulling weights, more than climbing, which I associate with hard, interesting moves. But well, I'm on the quest to train endurance, and I can go through this experience for some time, but I wonder, how far you can train endurance. Do you, mainly lead, endurance climbers, happen to fall from moves you consider "easy"? Or can you get to the point, where you need at least a bit demanding move to throw you off? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also I happen to try a route yestarday, on which i fell 1 clip from the top, I've gone down, and started the route again, so it's like a 1-2 minutes of rest, to take the rope down and tie a figure eight. I ended up falling almost in the same place, I think it was one move less. This must mean that I have some kind of endurance system working right, yet some other type of endurance very weak, as this route was two, and a half grades lower than my outdoor max. I would guess it's power endurance I need to train, but how is the energy system that makes me recover really fast when I'm not climbing for even a minute called?
I made a simple timer utility for pull up sessions. It allows you to switch between active and rest time to easily time rests between sets and then log total active and rest time afterwards. I thought someone else might find it useful so sharing around, android only I'm afraid :)
How to have super productive climbing sessions? I’ve plateaued at V4-V5 indoors and I don’t think strength is preventing me from climbing V6-V7, so my technique and mental game must be lacking. To improve those things it seems that I should just climb a lot and not get injured, but how can I make the most of my climbing sessions? I was thinking that maybe the people who improve the fastest are getting twice as much out of their climbing sessions as other people or more. Usually I just walk in and do whatever problems seem fun/interesting and I’ll maybe try a problem or two above my level. Should I have more of a plan for my sessions? What sort of problems should I work on? How many attempts should I give a problem before moving on? This is what I’ve come up with so far:

* Try hard. No half-assed attempts.

* Rest adequately in between attempts.

* Don’t over rest.

* Don’t over socialize.

* Repeat problems I’ve done before with better technique and more efficiency.

* Try problems that aren’t my style and try problems above my level.

* Don’t start problems from the bottom each time. Start from the part I’m having trouble with.

* Don’t bang my head against a wall, i.e., spend the entire session working hopelessly on one problem.

* Don’t move on from a problem too quickly.

* Don’t get frustrated. Relax and have fun.
Looking for podcasts/videos about people who balance climbing hard with work/other pursuits. I find that the people who balance climbing with professional pursuits/other hobbies most inspiring. Such people encourage me to dedicate myself to both climbing hard and other things.

Does anyone know any podcasts/videos/media that epitomises this approach to climbing?

Cheers,
Chalk made in Europe Hello,

as we all know over 70% of chalk is produced in China. Bought for a couple of cents from the producer, re-labeled and sold off with a huge markup. Do we know about any brands which produce chalk in Europe? I know about Seven Sisters chalk. Which is mined in France and prepared in England. If you lads know of such a thing could you also point me towards the store where they're selling it?

Thanks in advance and have a lovely day
Returning to Climbing Post Lockdown Hello fellow climbers, 

As is the case with most of you I assume, climbing gyms are beginning to open back up. during my forced hiatus from climbing I didn't do any climbing training but kept up my general fitness/strength. 

How can i get the most out of my first few sessions back? what kind of climbs/volume of climbing would everyone suggest? 

TIA
Lockdown Sold Me on the Benefits of Hangboarding I never hangboarded prior to March of this year. When my gym closed, I bought a Beastmaker 1000 and started a routine. My structure was pretty basic: 3 sessions/week mixing max hang sessions and repeater sessions. My only climbing was a two-day bouldering trip in July. 

Just got back from my first weekend rope climbing trip and really haven't lost a step. Prior to quarantine, I was onsighting in the 5.12a-12b range and had sent a few 5.12c's and one 5.12d. Last weekend, after almost no climbing in six months, I onsighted an 85 foot, pumpy 5.12a, came one move away from onsighting a 5.12b, and high-pointed a 5.12d project. I don't know if I've gained much in the last six months, but it was encouraging to know that I can take a half year off climbing and maintain some semblance of fitness!
Projecting Boulders vs. Projecting Routes I was hoping to start a discussion on the similarities and differences between projecting boulders and sport climbs.

Personally, I have a good amount of experience projecting sport climbs but will be making the transition to boulders soon and realized I don't quite know how to approach boulder projects. What things would a sport climber might not know about projecting boulders?
How to improve your ability to rest/recover on a route/problem? I find that, no matter how hard I shake out and relax my forearms on the "rest" holds, my other forearm gets even more exhausted trying to hold me while the other forearm "recovers".  At this point I am just switching between hands and not really recovering. 

I have heard the doing ARC training can improve how well you can recover/rest during a route, (improving blood flow and increasing the size of capillaries allowing for better recovery).

I have also heard that increasing your grip strength makes it easier to hold the "rest" holds, lessening the exhausting of the hand holding on while the other recovers. 

Are there any other tips or training methods for improving the quality of the "recovery/rest" during the climb?
Is it possible to effectively train work capacity simultaneously to training to push your grades? Conventional wisdom in this sub and other places says that if you start a heavy aerobic routine, it’ll get in the way of your bouldering recovery and things like that. 

I was thinking about how a lot of pros and other people do cool big hard stuff not only climb 5.13 and boulder v10 or something.  But they also have a great deal of aerobic capacity, and just an overall high motor to be about to do big objectives in the mountains. Those objectives will somewhat need an overall fitness that is reminiscent of trail runners more than boulderers. 

How do people balance the “Uphill athlete” training with the “pull hard on small edges while maintaining max body tension” training? 

I’m not super well read in all the training literature but it seems like people first get to a certain level of climbing strength and then work on fitness/work capacity.  And you just maintain your climbing strength as much as you can while building work capacity. However it is that the phases tend to be divided.

I’m mostly asking because I want to get strong at bouldering  before winter (by going to the gym during the week), and also get some good mileage on trad climbs on weekends. 

But by the time winter rolls around, I’d like to  also have enough aerobic fitness to be ski touring a good amount. 4K ft vertical days etc. 

In a perfect world my winter season would look like this: boulder 2-3x during the work week, and climb Saturday/ski tour Sunday. Dunno how best to balance this from a training perspective though leading up to the season. 

Thanks in advance for any advice or thoughts
Finger stiffness after hangboard training Hey all,

I've been climbing and training quite frequently and have found my muscles never really feel sore anymore. I do notice that after a hard hangboard session my fingers feel slightly stiff - not uncomfortable, but noticeable even the next day.

 Is this normal, or should I be watching for signs of overuse or potential injury?
Increasing strength to weight ratio question So im 6'4 168 lbs. That might sound pretty lean to you, and while i can kinda see abs, i can still pinch an inch on my hips and back and I also know i could be stronger. Are there any books anyone would recommend or a training program i could buy that coaches specifically on the proper way to eat and train to increase overall strength to weight ratio without gaining weight? Id like to stay at 168-170 lbs and turn the rest into muscle. I've already read training for climbing, but i struggle with putting together a training program in conjunction with climbing. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks much
Are weighted pull ups/ one arm pull ups worth the effort? So over lockdown I've trained a bunch of weighted pull up's and have moved on to one arm negatives. Now I can climb as much as I want again, I'm wondering if dedicating some of my recovery to them is worthwhile for my climbing?

Edit: maybe I was a bit vague, I boulder a lot outside in the v8-11 range I guess. I sport climb fair amount as well. Over lockdown got my weighted pull ups from 15kg to 25kg. 40kg max hangs on 20mm edge. I'm a pretty skinny guy and feel like a bit of body strength has helped me. I've been doing a fair bit of weight training lately along with campus. I feel stronger on the rock but it's hard to pinpoint what has been most beneficial. I just want to put my time into whatever will make me a better climber, also climbing's more fun than lifting weights.
Any advice on setting on a 45 degree wall? I feel like every time it takes me 5 times to figure out where the feet should go. I want to set feet that makes me rely on them more instead of just lunging all the time
5.14 sport climbers, can you provide insight into your progression? What were the primary contributing factors that helped you break into 5.14? I have been trying to push myself in sport climbing, but I’m struggling to connect my sport grade (~13b/c) with my bouldering grade (V11/12). Looking for advice from consistent 5.14 climbers on strategies to improve at sport climbing season after season.
Relearning how to multitask When i'm on steep boulders and the difficulty and stress increases I lose focus on pushing and pulling with my feet (and probably engaging core at the right time too), I seem to just isolate on thoughts crimping hard and pulling with arms. I've had my climbing critiqued a few times and it keeps being mentioned as a weakness. Basically I struggle focussing on more than 1 thing at a time particularly when things get stressed and difficult. This also means I struggle with dynamic moves ie. putting several things in place at once like pull and push.

I have been told this is due to a lack of doing sports and activity stuff when i was younger so that you get used to proprioception and multi tasking with your body. Ive been climbing for over 10 years (im in my 40's now) but it hasn't developed.

I therefore realise this is an inbuilt default I have but i'm committed to relearning even if it takes a few years. Is there any advice on how to begin to start thinking about working different body parts simultaneously but consciously. I am sure there is a definition for that, maybe it is proprioception.  Any texts out there or videos?

Some things i've tried:

Balance beam - has helped improve balance.

Moon board - I seem to revert to the default arm pulling.

No holds climbing - dont feel it was training my weakness of multitasking.

Happy to give anything a try though.

Cheers
How to not suck at climbing on an overhang As per title, I'm awful at climbing anything on an overhang (V4-6 on slab/vert, V3-4 on overhang). I get by primarily with passable technique and footwork and okay finger strength, none of which I seem to be able to transfer to climbing on anything worse than a shallow overhang. I'm not as strong as I would like to be but working on it (when I find the time).

I know the best way to improve at this level is to just climb a bunch of overhung stuff but I feel like at my current ability I either flash the problem because its all jugs to the top or the problem doesn't feel physically possible to me.

On a vert or slab if I fall off something often that I made a mistake or I messed up my footwork etc - something I can identify and work on until I get it right. If I fall off an overhang and I know the beta is right, I often I cant seem to identify what I did wrong (unless it's just a case of lacking the physical ability to do it I.e Upper body/core strength etc).

Any tips on how to improve? Things to concentrate on? Exercises to do? Or does it just boil down to getting stronger?
My free time is pretty limited at the moment so don't have the time to climb 3 times a week and train in between.
Covid taken into account my grade climbing overhanging routes plateaued pretty heavily for a while now, I've never been able to reach high V5/low V6 on an overhang like I can in other areas.
Any feedback at all is appreciated even if its 'stop being so lazy and lift some weights'... Thanks!

Edit - there have been loads of great responses and advice, i'm at work right now but i'll read and digest everything this evening. Thanks a lot people.
Transitioning from rope to boulderering Background: long time outdoor rope climber who wants to focus on outdoor bouldering for awhile. I can send 5.12+ but struggle on V5s. Female. Short (5').

Training: I have always climbed at a bouldering gym but never really pushed gym grades. I have started to train on weighted hangboard and can now Moonboard some V4/5. Have been focusing more on power because that is a definite weakness.

Issue: How do I get better at bouldering outdoors. I noticed it's an entirely different mindset i.e. the 100% try hard mentality. The  micro beta. Slightly irrational fear of falling and breaking ankle. No one else is close to my height so it's difficult to find beta.

Any tips and tricks to get better at bouldering?
After months of blood, sweat and tears I have finally got a releasable version of an app to track climbing progression. It allows you to enter all your climbs and then view stats like average grade and see a pie chart of all the climbs in your session. iOS and Android versions available
Climbing work capacity I have been climbing for a few months (I used to climb a lot years ago and took a long break, but I don't think it's relevant to this discussion), and I'm currently climbing 4 days a week, up from 2 days a week when I started. I am currently on vacation, so my recovery is pretty much on point, not many stressors in my life and I'm sleeping a lot. Still I feel like at the moment I can barely recover from my current climbing workload. I would like to be able to climb more, ideally 5-6 days a week when time allows.

What I'm curious about is what more experience climbers have to say about how their work capacity has increased over the years. Before climbing I used to powerlift, and the difference you can make in work capacity there (as in the amount of volume of a certain movement you can recover and make gains from) is huge, so I am wondering if something similar is achievable in climbing. Specifically, how has the amount of days you can climb in a week changed over the years? And did you take an specific approach to increasing this number?
Fear of heights indoors but not outdoors I've been climbing for roughly a year, mostly indoors and mostly top-rope, in the 5c-6b range. I've always been petrified by heights, and sometimes stop a route juste because I am too afraid to throw a move, that I would do easily if it were in a bouldering context.

I've very recently been climbing outdoors, both top-rope and lead and at the same 5c-6b range. And somehow... my fear is gone. Not completely, but definitely to the extent where it doesn't hinder my climb or stop me from throwing a hard move.

Has anyone experienced this? I'd love to be able to get that same "click" indoors, and lose that really annoying fear.
Inability to memorize beta holds me back I've climbed occasionally for the last 7 years (indoors, some alpine and some rock - always kind of sucked) and started climbing seriously about a year ago. During this time I've mostly been trad climbing below my maximum onsight level (6b/5.11a) and my hardest bolted red point is currently 7a (5.11d). 

While projecting I've discovered I am almost completely unable to memorize beta. Because I'm strong, this is not a problem on easier routes. I can usually get by by memorizing one or two crux moves and improvise on easier section. But once I start climbing around my limit, 90% of my falls are due to not remembering the beta. I get extremely frustrated because I know I'm physically capable of climbing harder than I currently do. Simply "trying harder" doesn't work - I can't even visualize the moves from the ground!

I'm guessing this is largely due to inexperience. But, what I realized is that my inability to memorize things has always been a problem for me in other settings; I'm a pretty decent guitar player but I've never been able to learn an entire song. And at university I had perfect grades on essays and oral presentations but always failed on written tests. Maybe it's an ADD thing?

I've read many books on training and technique but I've never really seen anyone mention this problem or how to improve. Maybe hard red points are just not for me, but I feel my climbing has improved a lot since I started projecting!
Out of breath when climbing limit routes I'm primarily a route climber, but started as a boulderer and think my body is better in the strength aspect as well. Now when I climb a route at my limit, I often get out of breath and sweat a lot. How much is this normal and is this a sign that I should improve something? Would general endurance like cardio help? I have also been told that I rest too little and need to work on splitting routes into sections. Could this be the issue here?
I suck at most climbs on the moonboard I've gotten V7 benchmark, but it just happened to be ones that my body just understood/was totally capable of. 

I suck at not slipping off the kickboard and grabbing the holds when I do big moves to them. Power is my weakest ability in climbing for sure, which is funny cause I'm more of a boulderer than a sport climber, I just climb very statically so dynamic movement is hard for me. 

What's the best bet to get better/see improvement: just keep climbing on the moonboard or do specific training off of the moonboard?
Are there adult climbing teams? I’m a 22m and I never really got any friends who climb for some odd reason idk I guess I’ve always been a solo type of lad but I would like to make some, I go to community college so there is no path there, anyways how would I go about finding a team if such a thing exists as I also feel like it could be the next step in leveling up my climbing as doing it alone doesn’t always give you the same push to improve if you’re in the wrong mood whereas a team can get you to confront weak points. Anyway anyone have advice?
Eating Healthy on the road Hey guys, I'm starting a long term road trip in a couple of weeks. Usually, when I do these trips I kinda let my diet go out the window and just eat whatever, but I'd like to change that this time around. What kind of foods do you guys eat to stay healthy, perform well, and recover?

&amp;nbsp;


I will have a small 25-quart fridge with me. I'm preferably looking for the simplest options; and I don't mind eating the same meals every day. Thanks in advance for any advice!
Tips on breaking through a grade So I'm setting a goal to climb V6 by New Years I consistently climb V4/5 and project but hardly get V5 any training tips or anything for motivation, as my climbing partner / long time friend left me. I know it's possible I just need to consistently train and maybe not get anymore climbing injuries
Why do many climbers say that outdoor routes &amp; boulders offer better training than gyms? I see this advice offered a fair amount on this sub, can anyone explain why? Thanks! :)
How to improve reaching high feet when red lining/pumped? I tend to struggle with getting my feet high when I am truly locked off at my limit, exhausted, pumped, etc. Besides just getting stronger, better power endurance, etc. what should I focus on? Am I not focusing on pushing with my opposite foot enough? Core?  Any drills to improve?
Best way to spend an hour a week on a hangboard? Currently climbing 3 times a week, typically 1 limit/projecting session, 1 volume session and a more relaxed social session with some friends etc. 

I've identified my core and tension is a major weakness in my climbing, in particular on overhangs, so I'm focusing on that a lot more in my training with more core-centric workouts, typically twice a week.

I would also like to train on my hangboard once a week but unfortunately between being a key worker, raising/training my puppy, actually climbing and other life stuff I have extremely limited free time.

So what is the best way to spend an hour or so on a hangboard? Bearing in mind it will probably be once or twice a week, not on a fixed day (my calendar is extremely variable).

At present I'm simply hanging on the 33mm edge and doing pull-ups which I recognize is not the most productive use of my time.
Am I holding myself back by only projecting the types of boulders im worst at? I just hit the 1year climbing mark (though i didnt climb a few months in quarantine) and been indoor bouldering solely for that time.

I have devloped this completionist attitude where my primary goal has been to get 100% of all problems below X grade in the gym. I finally sent the last remaining v4 and have done 50% of the v5s but never really done or even seriously tried a v6+.

I often will spend 1-2 months trying a sandbagged v3 crimpy problem that im terrible at every session to have completed the set but have never tried to project something hard in a style im good at. (Im 6'0 with 6'6 arm span and super flexible so that often makes up for lack of finger or core strength)

At v5 already some problems feel miles away and im not sure if its more efficient for me to just spend all my time on these to address the weaknesses or if ill get better faster trying to get a v6/v7 in my style then come back later.

Can those people that can climb v10+ cruise the entire gym v8 and below or do they just specialize in stuff theyre good at?

**TL;DR** emphasize projecting Vhard problems in my style or Vmedium in anti-styles?
Climbing open hips stance vs back flagging Hi there, I have a question about the technique of climbing with open hips vs flagging. What I've been told traditionally is that climbers should be climbing open stanced when the angle is vertical or slab, and with back flagging and hips to the wall when the angle is overhung. However, when watching videos with really top climbers on mellow (and even v9-v12 climbers on youtube), a lot of climbers keep their hips open stanced when climbing overhang; I especially notice this with Daniel Woods. Here are a few example videos:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeuwTRIZgNM&amp;ab_channel=mellow

Multiple cases where Jimmy webb stays open for a very overhanging boulder.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Kn4hbI5T2o&amp;ab_channel=mellow

Why do these top climbers climb without flagging for such overhung boulders? Is it because of where the footholds are, and it would be always better to back flag if there was a really good foot placement? Or is it actually better to climb open for overhang climbs once you get strong enough, cuz it gives you more options to use a higher foot?
How to stop over-gripping Hi guys! I find Ive been over-gripping a lot. Ive been Going to rifle quite a bit and while the holds arent small on most of the climbs Ive been on, they are slimy. After day two of climbing, my skin hurts and i have pink tips. No one else seems to get this since its limestone but I think its cause I grip too hard. 

Is there a technique to stop deathgripping every hold?
Bodyweight vs Strength Having a bit of a dilemma- 

Background: I'm about 6ft 190lbs. I naturally have bigger legs from genetics and a lot of hockey growing up, played lacrosse in college. Upper body needs some strength work as I'm kinda weak for my bodyweight. I was 165 about 10 years ago before I started lifting. Then i got into CrossFit and weightlifting but trying to move away from all that.

I want to be a better climber. I know strength is relative but important. And being lighter means pulling less weight around. Should I focus on getting stronger at my bodyweight, or lose weight and sacrifice some strength? Is there a safe way to do both? Thanks!
Moving to Mecca I'm moving from the Bay Area to Boulder in a few weeks, and am seeking advice on how to balance training, climbing indoors and outdoor climbing. I'm currently a weekend warrior with a home wall, so the balance has been pretty easy:

* Train power or power endurance early week
* Train antagonist mid to late week
* Drive 4 hours to climb in Yosemite on the weekends

Now that the nearest crag is going to be sub 20 minutes away rather than 3.5 to 5 hours, and my work will be remote and on PST (i.e. free mornings) I'm going to have more opportunities to climb routes/boulders outside daily (weather permitting), and am curious if any of you strong legends located in a climbing hub have advice on how to balance indoor/outdoor training to maximize progression.
I’m not having fun anymore. I have been climbing for over two years now. Before COVID I was projecting 5.12a-b indoor and loving every second of it, minus some drama with a belay partner I didn’t feel safe with. Now I don’t even feel confident on 5.10 and I don’t even find it enjoyable. Every time my friends want to lead climb I am torn because I know I’m going to be miserable the whole time, but I also know the only way to get better and keep up with them is to do it. I just got half way up a wall and said fuck this, bring me down. I don’t know why I can’t seem to enjoy this or get in the zone but it’s fucking infuriating and I just want to love this sport again. Any advice is appreciated, though I understand I’m coming across pretty ranty.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your advice! I did not expect this much response. I think some of you really hit the nail on the head with how much pressure I’ve been putting on myself. I got used to a certain standard of climbing and my pride and performance anxiety are getting in the way of being able to enjoy a sport that truly makes me feel whole. I’m going to try and take some of y’alls advice but I’m not ready to take a break as I don’t think it would really address the root of the problem. I’m going to read The Rock Warriors Way and try to work on my mental game and on the days that I’m not feeling it on lead I’ll head over to the bouldering wall to train. Climbing used to give me a sense of zen. I lost that over quarantine and I think I need to spend some time growing in humility and mental discipline again.

Edit 2: I also have an outdoor trip coming up in October that will hopefully help reignite the fire.
How to come up with balanced boulders or circuits on a spray wall. So the thing is that my right arm is stronger than my left ( i know it's normal), but i have noticed that when i come up with a circuit on my own i feel my right arm more pumped than my left which is a result of inventing a circuit harder for my right arm. The problem is i really don't know why it is like that, the hold sizes of the whole circuit are pretty much balanced but at the same time the moves for my right arm are harder. 

For example i want to know which is harder: a big move from e small crimp to a jug or a big move from a jug to a crimp. 

I know it's a strange and a stupid question but i really can't answer it.
Brick Forearms - Help Looking to incorporate daily stretching, and rehab of my forearm flexors into my routine.

I have neglected this - and as a result I think I have knotted, inefficient musculature in my medial forearms. 

Finding it very difficult / slow to recover in between sport climbing burns outside.

I feel like god forbid I get “flash pumped”, I’m struggling to get my right forearm in particular to feel de pumped even 30-45 minutes later before I tie in again. 

While I feel this is definitely the result of multiple factors (Spent the majority of the summer working a slab/vert project, probably not power endurance conditioned, this was an over hanging route, also have an oblique tear, and I climbed the day before without stretching/properly recovering at night).

Just looking for any suggestions for high quality, efficient, quick-ish daily fore arm flexor stretching. 

I have an arm aid sitting in a closet from back in the beginner gym climber tendonitis days. I’m thinking I should use that religiously in order to de-fuck the musculature mess in my forearms that I feel is preventing/slowing lactic acid clearance? Any arm aid users? Orange big ball or white 3-balls?  Also roll over? Or just press and pressure?

Anyways.

Climbing is hard. 

Also yes I’m over gripping. 

Also any suggestions for warming up the forearms before a pump route? I bring my portable hang board but I feel that warming up my fingers with some hangs doesn’t really get my forearm blood flowing as much as it just gets the finger tendons ready.
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT (your indoor homewall builds) With the threat of a second lock-down looming in the not so distance future (almost 100% happening here in Canada), I want to prepare by getting a home-wall built in my apartment. I had one during the first lock-down, but it was outside, and I don't necessarily feel like projecting on the wall in -20C weather. 

I'd love to see your indoor home wall builds, and gather clever ideas for fitting walls into small/unique spaces!

In particular my available space is ~8-10ft X 8ft. Gonna get crunchyyy
Power company movement drills. A few days ago i asked on the sub about a book for climbing technique. That's why i bought rock climbing technique by John kettle. I already read it and started incorporating some of the drills there. My plan is to experiment with every drill in the book for a few workouts and see which of them feel odd and strange, those will be the drills i will stick to in the long term. 

On the other hand i saw that power company are selling an e-book with movement drills too. Those of you that have read both books can you recommend buying the other one and what are the biggest difference between the two. 

Also i know about sloth and monkey climbing drills that originally are designed by power company and they aren't mentioned by John Kettle. Are those of you that have sticked with those two drills have seen an improvement in their technique? And what improvement. 

P.S. thank you so much about the recommending rock climbing technique, it's an amazing book that have already changed my view of climbing technique and I didn't already sticked to any of the drills. I recommend it too!
How to build a collaspsible home woody? I see a few YT videos and Reddit posts about how to build a home woody, but I haven’t seen any that’s easily collapsible so I can take it with me if I moved without too much difficulty.

also, anyone have tips for finding a carpenter/handy person who can help, how to know if they’re knowledge, and what a reasonable cost for their labor would be?
Moonboard Ranking and Benchmark Questions So Im trying to work myself through the benchmarks, not very far so far, and two things still confuse me:
1.) Only benchmark ascents count towards the ranking right?
2.) How does a problem become a benchmark problem? Simply enough repeats with common agreement about a grade?

Thanks in advance
Would love some advice on weighted pull-ups Hi, strong people.  

I would love some advice from people who (unlike me) know what they are doing. I weigh about 165 lbs and my one rep max for pull-ups is currently around 215-220 (bodyweight + 50-55 lbs). With no weight added I can probabaly bust out around 12 pull-ups. Currently lead about 11b (6c) outside.

&amp;nbsp;

Have so far been using [this program](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/51z2z7/guide_creating_a_weighted_pullup_program/).


I'm generally looking to work on power endurance. What sort of weight/sets/reps/frequency should I be working with?

&amp;nbsp;

**More info for people who love reading / procrastinating:**

I'm in LA, so besides the occasional outdoor trip to places that aren't currently on fire, I haven't been able to climb much in the last 7 months or so. Snagged a hangboard early (BM 1000), and have been doing that 3 times a week plus core exercises, push-ups, and pull-ups/frenchies.
Exercises for improving toe hook force I tend to neglect using my lower body effectively when climbing and recently I have struggled with some boulder problems requiring toe hooks when my legs are both stretched and bent up close to my chest.

I believe that the toe hooks where my legs are bent, my hip strength/flexibility is a factor. I have no problem getting into the correct position, but creating the tension I find very difficult.

Has anyone got any tips and exercises that could help me to improve toe hooking?
What do you do in your deload/recovery weeks? I’m interested to know how you all train during your off weeks. Do you climb? Lift? Do you do any hangboarding to maintain finger strength? How often and for how long do you deload? Do you bother at all or feel like you need it?  

Not necessarily looking for specific advice for my own situation, I’m just curious as we talk a lot about training, but not so much about how we rest. 

I train mainly indoors for competitions currently, and personally I do a v light week (40-50% volume compared to normal), a week at 75% before going into my next phase. I normally do 2-3 short light climbing sessions, maybe some aerocap for example, and my regular core and weights at much lighter loads than normal.
What do you use to record video of yourself climbing? Hey All,

I want to start recording myself to better understand my technique/lack thereof. I also want to waste time making fun videos of myself climbing unremarkable problems that have seen hundreds of ascents. (lol)

Trouble is that my jank ass iPhone runs out of battery in like 10 minutes if the temperature is below 70 degrees. I'm thinking of getting a budget/mid-range action cam. Ideally $100 or not much more.

Do any of you use these? Can you recommend one model in particular? Reviews on many of the cheap ones seem mixed. Is 4k excessively high resolution?

Thanks!
How many days should I climb/workout I’ve been climbing about 2 years now, on and off for a bit than seriously for a year and then quarantine I fell off but I’m back in the gym and sending v7 again, I also started to mop board and am going through all of the 6b+ benchmarks at the moment. I hit the gym every other day and usually dedicate 1 or 2 of the days each week to just working out, this is usually a mix of weights, campus board, and various climbing oriented exercises. I’m very serious about getting better, my question is should I be going more frequently? What’s the optimal days on days off for maximum climbing gains?
Do high level climbers adjust the force on each finger individually on a hold? I was wondering if good climbers consciously decide to push harder with certain fingers on holds such as slanted crimps that are not oriented in a favourable position where you can't equalise the force on the fingers by leaning perpendicular to the crimp.
Unpopular Opinion: Technique is overrated (discussion) Clarification:

\- I am NOT saying technique is not important.

\- Just a little change in your beta (hence a 'better technique') can help you send a problem quite effortlessly compared to your previous attempts with a different beta

&amp;#x200B;

With those said, the reason I'm making this post is honestly what you guys think about the things below.

1. Ever since I started climbing about 5 years ago, the emphasis on technique both online and in real life has been tremendously huge. Virtually everyone I talked to/seen has mentioned the importance of technique so much to a point where I began to think technique is far superior to finger strength.
2. I've been told numerous times an improvement in your technique alone will help you climb at least a grade harder.

&amp;#x200B;

While I don't necessarily disagree with those, the best example I can think of why I think technique can sometimes be vastly overrated is my friend.

He has been climbing for about 3 years with virtually zero previous athletic background (unlike myself).

He can climb a grade harder than I can me climbing at around V9 range while he can climb around a V10 range (please remember his climbing age 3 years while mine is 5 years.... and I've been way more consistent while being injury free).

I have asked at least a dozen different climbers all who have been climbing for some time (ranging around 3 years to 20 years) what their opinion was on our technique.

With literally no bias on the clips I've shown them, the answer was unanimous: my technique is objectively and far better than my friend's. If anything, there are many times when I honestly think my friend's technique is just straight up atrocious.

A lot if not most people I've seen/met/read (their comments online) have seemed to give me this idea that somehow technique is far superior to finger strength and while that might be true for straight up beginners, once you learn most of the applicable techniques (which isn't hard at all!!!), it just straight up feels useless to spend time improving technique.

I think what I'm trying to say is I almost feel 'cheated' by spending so much time and effort improving my technique while there are people like my friend who just fucking ignore the shit out of technique and climb with just utterly poor technique and get away with it.

Of course, if my friend were to improve his technique, I understand that he may or may not climb a grade harder. But the point is I find it incredibly annoying that even the double digit  climbers seem to underestimate the importance and the strength of their own finger strength and attribute a huge deal to their technique when in reality I feel as if there is such a huge diminishing returns when it comes to technique whereas the same can't really be said for finger strength.

Let me know what you think.
Question about muscular imbalances... Okay, so I’ve been climbing for 4+ years, obsessively, and have never focused much on antagonist training (aside from the occasional pushups here and there). In the past 6 months I’ve had crazy tension in my upper back, through my neck, and into where my trapezius attaches to the base of my skull... tension but bordering on constant pain. Furthermore, I’m a dentist and work 5 days a week at a busy practice, so I’ve been assuming it’s work related. As in, my head is slightly looking down for the better part of my work life. 
Thinking it’s from my job, I’ve been stretching daily, using a massage gun (super fun on the base of your skull, your eyes rattle around in your head like popcorn on a stovetop), and have been contemplating a chiropractor. 
Then I bench pressed randomly the other day and immediately felt some relief. Could this actually be the cause?? As in, my muscular imbalance is so bad that it’s causing constant tension on my neck and back? Has antagonist training been something we actually should be doing regularly like everyone tells us too?? Lol
Anyways, love the community and wanted to hear your thoughts, and any advice on this issue would be super appreciated... it’s driving me crazy
Regression Hello! M/24, been climbing for about 3 years, mostly indoor Bouldering with some outdoor scrambling. I’ve been becoming noticeably worse over the last two months climbing wise. Grades yes, but also just feel heavy and bad and sloppy on the wall. I could climb most v5s before (not that grades matter, just a baseline) and now can do about half v4s. Any ideas for training to reverse this? I don’t do much off wall outside of stretching, but climb about 3 times per week
A secret technique - The Hump About 3 years ago, I thought of something that has revolutionized climbing for me. I thought I would share. I don't think this is well known or talked about very much, but most climbers whose technique I respect do it.

I've been calling it "the hump". The short explanation is this: On non-lockoff moves, you sag your hips away from the wall, then hump towards the wall. You should be latching the hold when your hips are closest to the wall.

The longer explanation: This technique has three main benefits. The first is that it effectively doubles the amount of time you get to reach the next hold. Think about it. If you bee-line it to the hold, you only get the time it takes for your COM to fall away from the wall. If you do the hump, you get the time it takes for your COM to go towards the wall, and then away from the wall. For you math folk out there, since motion is parabolic, beelining is effectively half of the parabola, where as humping nets you the whole parabola.

Secondly, it allows you to really deadpoint. If you ever have felt the feeling of hitting a hold but feel like you are already falling, this is for you (so, everyone). When most people think of a deadpoint, they think of a dynamic move and that's it. Well, the word "deadpoint" comes from latching a hold at your body's "dead" point - the vertex of your bodies natural parabolic motion. I think this concept is decently well known instinctively to climbers in two dimensions. If you have ever said "I overshot/undershot the hold" then you understand what a deadpoint means. However, the hump allows you to deadpoint in the vertical plane perpendicular to the wall. Essentially, perfectly crafted hump allows you to hit the next hold when your COM is closest to the wall while not overshooting/undershooting the hold.

Lastly, the hump allows you to utilize your feet more. Not only does the hump buy time, which in effect makes you stay on your feet longer, but the hump also allows you to generate extra momentum to carry your COM over your feet. This is especially important on fall-in moves and jumps.

I've made a (lengthy, \~20m) [video](https://youtu.be/fGhK85Chp34) analyzing why humping is beneficial to non-static movement. Visuals really help describe what I'm talking about here. Full with graphs and examples.

EDIT:  Timestamps: Initial Examples: 1:40 Increased time explanation: 3:32 Deadpoint Definition: 5:30 Close to the wall: 8:00 Humping Deadpoint: 11:24 Humping Examples: 13:40

Edit 2: it seems like people don't like the word secret. Yeah it's not necessarily anything hidden, however I think the intuitive part is the vertical axis deadpointing. What isn't intuitive is moving your hips away from, normal to the wall. I've watched thousands of climbers' and hundreds of v10+ climbers that don't do this technique well. I've talked to over 10 of these double digit climbers about this and all of them have been unaware of this. It's not just sagging, it's sagging your ass away from the wall not just down. I encourage you to rewatch videos of yourself climbing and compare it to the last example I show of @bantheunisse climbing on the moonboard. Thanks for reading and watching!

There's a couple of other subtle movement ideas that have popped up throughout the years. Let me know if this is helpful or not - I wouldn't be opposed to making videos about other moves like "the scorpion".
Is 7 months to train realistic? Hello! I am a 24 year old female, climbing for 4 years now and planning to go to Indian Creek in May. Currently I am about 30 pounds overweight and am projected to reach my goal by February. 
My goal is to crush some hard 11s and not die on the approach. 
Currently climbing 5.10 face and 5.10d crack (size dependent of course). 
I’m making the appropriate lifestyle changes and have started a training plan that I think is manageable without running the risk of overtraining. 
Just curious if anyone thinks I’m not being realistic timeline wise.
Those of you who live in your car / van / RV: What does your training look like? Hi folks! I've been lurking here for a while, but decided to make an account to post here.

Currently, I'm living full time out of a smaller car, but by the end of the year, I'll be living full time in a smaller cargo van. This is relatively new for me, so I'm still working out all the kinks. 

When I was living in an actual house, with my own room, etc., I had access to a fridge, more complicated forms of cooking, door frames to mount a pullup bar / hangboard, space to stretch / roll out, etc. Now that I'm living in a car, my ability to do these things has changed. For example, hangboarding involves finding a tree that I can hang the board from, and cooking is limited to a frying pan and a basic camping stove. These are some "negative" losses in terms of how I can train.

On the other hand, my new mobility allows me to stay 10mins away from any crag I want within a 2 hour range of my school, so long as I have service on my phone to do work, etc.

Anyways, I'm just curious... if you are someone who's living a non-traditional life, such as in a car, or RV, or van, what does your training look like? Right now, a big barrier in some aspects is that all the gyms around me are still closed. What's your training looking like right now? How has living in a car / van / RV affected, either positively or negatively, your training, performance, and so on?
What people want in a portable hang board? Hello there, 

So this a is follow on post, but I am currently doing my GCSE DT and my project is a hang board. I've decided to make a portable one so, are there any specific hold types and sizes, wood or plastic, literally anything to do with a hang board that people would like too see. Anything is welcome and I will most likely post update photos. 

Thanks
Examples of pro climbers (or semi pro) that DIDN'T start climbing as a child/youth? Looking for inspiration. I've been curious lately if there are any pro climbers, or at least climbers who are close to pro, who didn't start climbing when they were a kid or in their early teens. It seems like that is almost required now to climb at that level of V14 or above or 5.14 and above. It's been kinda bumming me out lately as it gets in my head and makes me not want to try as hard (not that I'm anywhere close to climbing those grades). I'm looking for any examples you guys know of climbers who didn't start climbing when they were in adolescence but still climb really hard. Thanks!
Sloppy climbing due to poor body tension, lack of lock-off strength, or bad technique? I recently started filming myself on some boulders and noticed that my climbing often looks sloppy. What particularly caugth my attention was that my body tension drops whenever I make a hand move. Below I added a link to a video in which this issue is quite obvious.

[https://streamable.com/a7d7u9](https://streamable.com/a7d7u9)

Back ground on the boulder: The wall is 45 degrees overhanging. The yellow holds have relatively poor friction. I think the grade is around V6 / 6C+.

I started climbing 3.5 years ago and mainly focus on lead (level:  5.12b / 7b). However, I would like to improve my bouldering where I am currently stuck at around V6. I think strength-wise a am doing quite well. I can do one-arm pull-ups at 75 kg body weigth. But from the filmed climbs it appears that my lock-off strength is quite poor since my body drops whenever I release one hand.

Is this an issue of poor technique or do I have to work on my body tension / lock-off strength?

Thank you for the feedback!
Don't know where else to post this; I climbed my first 7b+!! I've been following this sub for around a year now because I wanted to break the famous "5.12" plateau. I reached 5.11d legit the first year I started climbing, but I was never able to push through it in 4 years. Started going to the gym 3 times a week instead of 1-2 and followed some bouldering/training advice I found on this sub. I started getting more v5 flashes and some v6s here and there, but my goal has always been 5.12b or 7b+. 

I climbed a 5.12a but it didn't feel that good. I thought "eh probably a 5.11d in my style" which it definitely was. So I've been projecting this 5.12b (7b+) for about a month now and finally sent it :)!!

In the words of Chris Sharma though "as soon as you clip the last anchor, you're already thinking of your next project"... well said Chris. And now 5.12c here I come.

Thanks for the help guys!
V10+ Climbers With Surprisingly Weak Fingers (Discussion) So I know of 3 people that fit this criteria: my friend's friend, Emil from eric karlson bouldering, and Paul Robinson.

When I say weak fingers, the weight they can hang with on the hangboard relative to their max grade is much lower than let's say average of that grade (i.e. if 1,000 people's highest grade is V11, let's say the average weight those people can hang on Y edge is X, the weight of the people I'm talking about is .6X on the same edge)

As a reference, I will be providing each person's max outdoor grade with his respective hangboard data.

**Friend's friend (let's call him Adam):**

Max Grade: V12

Max Hang: 1-2 sec on the beast maker 2k middle edge (\~.9 inches; it's between .8 and 1 inch) with one arm

**Emil:**  
 

Max Grade: V13 (as far as I know)

Max Hang: 3-4 sec on the beast maker 2k middle edge with one arm.  
(*I know he's improved his finger strength so I'm obviously referring to a while back when his fingers were that strong)*

&amp;#x200B;

**Paul Robinson:**

Max Grade: V15 

Max Hang: 5 sec with \~25 lbs on the beat maker 2k middle edge with one arm (estimated)

10 sec on 10mm with 80lbs extra weight with two arms (Paul left a comment to someone's comment).

&amp;#x200B;

Now I want to make sure we are on the same page:  


1. I am well aware that hangboard number may be a poor indication of someone's ability to climb a hard problem. Example: people who never climb can train their fingers to a point where they are easily able to do a one arm pull up on the beast maker 2k middle edge, but that doesn't mean they will climb a V10. 
2. I have climbed a few V9's outdoors and I can already hang on the beat maker 2k middle edge for about 4-5 seconds.
3. I know multiple people that can climb around V9-V11 range who have either similar finger strength or much greater.
4. Finger strength data show that there is a positive association between max hangs and max grade (i.e. the higher the grade a person can climb, the greater the weight they can hang with on the hangboard, *typically).*

That leaves us something to think about.

1. How are they climbing so much harder problems with such weak fingers? (weak relative to the grade they are climbing)

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts:

I have thought about this for a while and have come to a few logical points:

1. Their ability to recover between consecutive moves must be greater than the average person who can climb the same grade in order to compensate for weaker fingers.
2. Hangboard isn't the best indicator of finger strength for everyone. It should be for more people than not though at least IMO.
3. Technique 
4. Poor one arm strength leading to an inaccurate one arm hang data

Now the thing I can't seem to understand is even with all those points I've just talked about, I just cannot wrap my head around the fact that I have stronger fingers than Old Emil who was climbing V13's while my max grade is a measly V9.

The difference between V9 and V13 from a perspective of a V9 climber is simply ***humongous.***

Like it's so big I can't even fathom how any of the points I brought up could help me climb a V13 at my current level of finger strength.

Some might argue Emil's core and pulling strength are much better and etc. and I grant such a possibility even though my weighted pull strength isn't bad (1.83x bodyweight for 1 rep max) and I can quite easily do an almost fullly extended ab wheel rollout without my knees touching the ground for 4-5 reps. I am also 2 inches shorter while being a lot lighter than he is. (I am about 5 11 and 140lbs while Emil at that time was 6 1 and about 165-170 lbs)

It's also possible that Emil just has an amazing technique although let's be honest. Is V9 --&gt; V13 possible with only an improved technique? Especially given the context I've been climbing for a while so I don't have that big of a room for technique improvement?

Ultimately, I'd like to know how these super strong climbers can climb the grade they can climb while others with similar **if not greater finger strength** with **similar level of technique and strength in other areas** can't. And sometimes they don't even come close. Like in my case and emil's.
Losing fat and weight I am a 20 year old female and I started climbing in July this year and have fallen in love with the sport. Finally a hobby I can put my time and love into. Like most beginners I've noticed a steep curve in improvement and it's been fun to get better every session. I've built strength and improved my technique tremendously. However, one thing that remains the same is my weight and I am confident that it is holding me back. I have a BMI of 24.8 and I'm struggling with losing fat.

I'm counting calories and struggle eating less than the limit without feeling hungry, starving. I eat plenty healthy, lots of volume and enough fat. I make all my food myself. I rarely drink and I also run a few times a week. I never eat refined sugar. I also struggle to figure out how many calories I should eat, like how many calories does a climbing session burn? Hard to tell. Any tips, anyone who has struggled with the same?

Edit: I'm also a type one diabetic if it matters
Value in repeating climbs? I'm primarily a sport climber with 2-3 years of experience, working my way through the intermediate grades. I try to go to the gym 2-3 times a week, 1-2 times just leading routes with a partner and at maybe once training by myself (limit bouldering, conditioning, autobelays). Like many people, I tend to warm up on routes that are a few letter grades below my flash level, then for the bulk of the session I move to routes that are at or above my flash level. Once I finish such a route cleanly, I tend to not repeat it, unless it's a particularly nice climb or there are no other good things to work on. I've been wondering recently if it could be a more worthwhile time investment to repeat more of these routes at my limit, trying to make them go more smoothly. What do you think?

Should I prioritize climbing outdoors, over training indoors? I currently climb/train 3 times a week. On Tuesday I train technique/efficiency, and then Thursday and Sunday are just max bouldering sessions. Should mention, gym will shut on Friday for 2.5 weeks at least.

So this leads me to my main question, should I prioritize climbing outdoors over climbing indoors? I remember Dave Macleod talking about training on his board, and he said if it was dry, he'd climb outdoors. I live in Wales, so by now dry days are far in-between. 

So say if Tuesday was dry, which is the day I usually train technique, should I climb on that day, or wait until a max bouldering sessions and climb outdoors then instead? Or should I climb on Tuesday, and move my usual technique session forward to Thursday? Bare in mind this coming Tuesday and Thursday are going to be my last chance to climb in the gym for the next 2.5 weeks.

So to sum up my questions:

1. Should I climb outdoors on the day I have climbing gym specific training?

2. If I do climb on a day I have climbing specific training, should I move it later in the week?

3. Should I only prioritize climbing outdoors on days I have max bouldering sessions? (Thursday and Friday)

Edit: current goal is to climb hard on rock
Is it worth paying for coaching as a beginner/intermediate? I've been bouldering, nearly all indoors, for about two years now, with a couple of long breaks in between due to injuries/covid shutdowns. I'm back to climbing about 6b which is the best I've ever climbed. I feel I could do with some guidance regarding how to structure my sessions, specifically with regards to strength training.

Is it worth paying for advice for this sort of thing? Anybody around this level have experience with it?
Bouldering rest times between working beta &amp; attempts. Hi guys, I was wonderig what kind of rest times you have when working beta on boulder problems?

Right now I'm getting into the habbit of way too many goes trying to wire moves with little rest and burning myself out before any real goes.
is it possible to be a decent sport climber but a terrible boulderer? and upper body power training tips I'm currently finding myself struggling on v5s indoors (I've done some v5s and v6s indoors before - mostly crimpy stuff) but I am just really sucking at the moment. But I have climbed 2 6c sport routes outdoors (and didn't feel like I was climbing at my limit) so I want to project a 7a outdoors - I tried it at the weekend and it was wet but it felt maybe doable over a couple of sessions when dried out.

But I'm really doubting myself and feel like I'm lying to myself. Would it truely be possible to be able to send a 7a when my boulder level is so low? Has anyone got experience or knows of people who can outdoor lead climb to a much higher level than their boulder grade?

second question: the specific indoor boulders I struggle on are involving generate power with my upper body. Really struggling on slopey/blocks/dynamic boulders that require some campusing. and when I have to generate power with one leg flagged I find that real hard too. I feel like my general upper body strength and one arm strength is limited (I am also a tiny female), any training advice? - I can only do about 7-10pulls ups, I'm trying to start weighted pull ups. I can campus on jugs but not on wooden campus ladder. thanks in advance :)
Technique feels sloppy but only on hard climbs On easier vert climbs I feel really good about rotating my hips and my climbing feels smooth for the most part.  However when the feet get smaller, I feel ass sags outward and I climb very boxy. I also feel like I have trouble pushing through any feet that aren't positive or are really small. 

So is this a core weakness? Leg strength issue? Footwork problem? A combination of all 3? 

What are some drills to work on this? I can't see myself doing drills on easier climbs because feet get better and my issue goes away.

Edit: Another note is that it's really hard for me to push off of slopey feet into deadpoint moves where my foot comes off of the shitty foot
Exercises for better body tension? Hi everyone.

Does anyone know of good workouts or videos that focus on better body tension and "foot strength?" I feel like I'm at a point that hangboarding more would me unbalanced, and my feet / core need to get better for me to actually climb harder routes.

Thanks!
Is 3 finger drag the most effective way to strengthen lumbricals? I’ve injured the lumbrical muscles in my hands on three seperate occasions due to awkward and tweaky movements on the wall that have caused my pinky finger to drop. At this point, I’m reluctant to hold a two finger pocket with the middle and ring finger or really any scenario that involves my pinky dropping. I’ve trained half crimp and open hand crimp on a hangboard for quite some time, but I’m wondering if I need to slowly introduce 3 finger drag hangs into my regimen. Would this be the best idea, or is there a more effective solution to strengthen the lumbricals?
Building endurance tips after having covid I had the corona virus a little over a month ago and got hit pretty hard. It was about 5-6 weeks of no activity/climbing and my endurance got wiped. I've been focusing on technique to get my strength back which had helped, but I still notice my endurance is no where close to what it was. What tips/exercises do you suggest to help get me back to where I was? (V5 bouldering and 11.c/b)
Deadlifting and squatting for climbing Was wondering what your opinions are on doing these lifts to increase core and leg strength? Is it worth packing weight onto your legs and glutes for a bit of extra strength in an area that’s not used as often?
"If you want to climb harder, climb harder!" (a friend of mine, a few weeks ago) (he was right, at least in my case)

Hey there!

So I just led my first 6c+ outside and I'm super excited because that's far more than what I was hoping for this climbing trip. For me personally this quote from the title really holds true. During the last few months, my mindset was like I just couldn't go any further than 6a+ anyway and so I rarely tried hard. (Nonetheless of course there can be lots of other reasons why someone isn't progressing - also I wasn't necessarily frustrated because my intention is mainly to have fun when climbing.)

So that's not really a question nor a novelty...but I thought maybe some of you might need a little hint too!
If my muscles don't feel sore after a limit bouldering session does that mean I'm not trying hard enough? For some background info I'm 19 yo, don't eat very healthily and do no sports other than climbing. I tend to climb around 2/3 times a week and I usually limit boulder/project hard moves. I don't do any supplementary training and I climb around v7 indoors, projecting v8+.

Last week I went to the gym twice in one day, barely climbed in my first session but tried very hard in my evening one, and the next morning I was sore all over (first time I've felt this way in a long time) and it made me think:

**If you don't feel sore or tired the next day, does that mean that the limit bouldering I'm doing is not limited by muscular strength rather than finger strength or technique? If I don't know what my biggest weakness is, is this a good indication that I am strong enough for the moves but am lacking in some other department?**

EDIT: Seems like volume is the main cause of soreness. Thankyou all for your insights.
mental training/overcoming fear after being dropped by my belayer resulting in a year long injury, im looking to read a book to help with fear of falling/trust. ideally, the book would have content to question my inner dialogue and unravel the limitations of my mind.

the rock warrior's way and espresso lessons by arno ilgner seem like they could be useful, but im wondering what the best book is for what i am seeking. any suggestions are appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: overwhelmed by the amount of comments. thank you all so much for sharing your wisdom and knowledge - absolutely useful in overcoming these obstacles.
When to do power endurance/ endurance during a session So I was talking to a friend of mine the other day about when to do your endurance stuff. He said you should do power endurance and endurance at the start of your session, so that you climb well and get the most out of it. He then proceeds to do a regular bouldering session after he's completely exhausted from endurance stuff. This Is how he's been doing power endurance for years. I thought the exact opposite. I usually boulder for around two hours, and then do 4x4s, and then circuits last. This way I have power to give my all Bouldering, then when im fairly fatigued but still have power left I do power endurance and finally endurance. What are people's opinions on this? I guess it depends what your training for too, as he only Boulders and I sport climb as well as boulder. So I want my power and endurance to last me the whole day for a day out at the crag, whereas he only wants to train for power endurance specific boulder problems. Thoughts?

Edit* 

A bit more context. I live in a small town and don't have access to a gym, but we do have a 40 degree moon board and 30 degree spray wall. I climb 4 times a week, with 3 moon board days and 1 spray wall day. 2 moon board days I do 2 hours, 1 moon board day I do 1 hour 30 mins, then two sets of 4x4s and lastly 15 minutes of endurance on the spray wall. Last day is also 1 hour 30 mins spray wall and then 4x4s. The general consensus seems to be: power- power endurance- endurance, respectively. If I continue to climb 4 days a week, should I maybe do 2 moon board days, 1 spray wall day and then a day for only power endurance and endurance? I've seen some comments saying cramming it all into a session gives risk of injury. 

Ive climbed a few bench v10s on the moon board and so far in my 8 years climbing havnt had tweaky fingers for more than a day or any climbing related injuries. I've only recently starting looking into proper training programs and when to do what so I'm torn between people's opinions and dont really know what's true. should I just keep doing what I'm doing if my fingers and body feel fine? Cheers :)
Slab for technique? Hi everyone, I’d like some of your opinions regarding a discussion I’ve been having with my climbing partner. 

He claims that slab climbing is a sure-fire way to improve climbing technique (greater awareness of body position, balance etc). On the other hand, I’ve always thought that slab climbing just gets you better at slab climbing and is not worth doing unless for its own sake. 

Would love to hear your views on this. Do you train slab as a way to improve climbing performance on other terrain? Do you ever climb slab at all?
Vegetarian climbers? Have been toying with the idea of going on a vegetarian diet for many reasons. My biggest worry is regarding my protein intake. I am a routesetter as well so I have to stay in healthy shape for work. 

Any vegetarian climbers out there? Any advice, recipes, supplements, app, or anything else to share?  Thank you!


Edit: Thank you all for your responses so far! Please keep them coming. This is exciting! I’ll read through them and try to respond. Again, thank you so so much!
I started a Lattice Lite Plan - here's some thoughts/observations after roughly 2 weeks Hey all! I recently bit the bullet and purchased a lattice lite plan, and thought it'd be interesting to provide some updates on here as I move through the program, and especially to compare it to my at-home training and see if it really does give an advantage over what I was able to put together with online and literature-based resources on my own. Seeing as the lite plans are even a relatively steep investment themselves, I figure I might do one of these every couple weeks to keep track of how I'm feeling/improvements/qualms I'm noticing, but mostly to be objective in comparing to the self-governed training I was doing over quarantine and a bit before and if this was really worth the $$$ I dropped on it. Anyways:

For the first two weeks, I don't feel that it's fair to speak on improvements/deteriorations, as until I move into my first deloading week mid-November I doubt I'm going to notice any real changes. That said, I definitely feel that I will notice shifts if they happen, as I was spurred to purchase the plan in the first place due to a plateau that started late-July and has, for the most part, continued into the present, so it'll be easy to see shifts in performance as I know quite well where I was stagnating before this point.

This is more barebones on general differences in how I trained versus how my plan's set up, without exact details as I don't want to breach any confidentiality stuff.

* As far as I can tell, Lattice doesn't necessarily periodize their lite plans, something I always thought was a big no-no in training. I'm doing a little bit of everything per week, whereas for my own training plans, I was setting up month-long system-specific blocks (ie. 1 month specifically power endurance, 1 month specifically max strength, etc). This is honestly a bit refreshing, as it gets boring to do almost the same exercises 2-3x per week for a month straight, so I really have no qualms with this.
* I do feel more motivated to do every aspect of my workout to completion, as the Crimpd app almost bullies you with an incomplete if you don't finish an aspect of the plan by the end of the week. This is good, as things like a proper stretching session that I maybe managed to motivate myself to do once per month on my own now feel more worthwhile (maybe because the American education system conditioned me to lose my shit if I don't see full points on something).
* It's nice to both know after the assessment exactly what my weaknesses are. Obviously, after running the same assessments on my own at home, being told that power is my weakest link wasn't terribly surprising (I'm more of a dave graham but-make-it-5'6" build than a jweb body type), but knowing exactly in comparison to data they've collected where that stands in terms of priority is cool, and I also learned that I'm stronger and weaker in certain areas than I previously thought (better hip flexibility than I thought I had, way worse power endurance than I expected).
* More of an emphasis on using climbing to train than equipment based exercises, which are what I was doing at home and what the experienced friend who was making me training plans last year moreso had me doing as well. This is great, as the less time per week spent doing mindless hangboard protocols and the more spent actually using climbing as a training tool makes this far less miserable. That's not to say that I'm not doing any weighted hangs/pull-ups by any stretch, but only doing them averagely once per week rather than 2-3x per week as the only training method makes me want to train more, so I can't really complain.

That's it for now, but I'm excited to see where this takes me, as although I certainly have fun making myself workout plans, it's nice to have one made by people who have actual degrees in exercise science and understand training physiology better than myself and my armchair google degree.
Regular de-load week? So I finally got over my pre-covid plateau and rather than take a de-load week I continued with my regular routine and subsequently tweaked my wrist a bit. 

I think I got overly psyched after sending a project and a few hard boulders I previously couldn't get near and decided to try and keep the momentum up by starting work on another limit boulder that is my anti-style.

The injury is not that bad as I cut the session short and have rested ever since, but i'm wondering if I should start building a regular de-load week into my schedule to prevent stuff like this from happening.

So does anyone else take a regular de-load week? What sort of frequency? What sort of stuff will you do (if any) while you are de-loading?

For reference my usual weekly routine is some variation of the following:  
Limit session - rest - core/strength training - Flash grade/technique session - rest - core/strength training - social/volume session
Training for sport climbing periodized vs non-periodized training? Hey!

So I've been bouldering &amp; hangboarding a lot recently, feeling strong but I've really been neglecting sport climbing. So winter is upon us and with the majority of my climbing time being spent indoors, and as I'm really looking to step up my sport climbing game for next year. I have at least 3-4 months before weather improves to train for it.

I can't decide what to do, something like Steve Maisch's plan where you're training endurance all the time. Or following something like alex barrows suggests where I'm doing a bunch of an cap and ARC'ing for a month or two then switching my focus over to power endurance/ 4x4's for the last couple months.

Tl;dr: Basically I have 4 months to train for sport climbing, what would you guys suggest?
Being tall and getting in scrunched up positions Hi all,

I'm 6 foot and I feel like one of the main challenges I run into, particularly when bouldering, is when the positioning of the holds requires you to get really scrunched up, I have a hard time staying near the wall/making the next move (e.g. low opposite pulling compression hand holds + high feet and sometimes + high next handhold). 

Do any tall climbers have tips on working moves like these? Is it simply a matter of body positioning? I find it especially difficult with small handholds/crimps because having high feet/scrunched body naturally pulls my body away from the wall and makes it really hard to hold on.
Plateau despite notable physical progress Maybe this is normal but it's been quite frustrating for me.

The last few months I was fairly succesful with my training goals, of which I had a few. The first couple of months I couldn't climb, but as soon as I got back I felt stronger than ever. That I expected, because it happened twice before when I got injured.

What I didn't expect was my improvement not making a difference on my climbing, as it had done in the past. Particularly since I had never improved on so many areas at once, specially on finger strength. (If anyone cares I'll include details about that).

Maybe I'm just tired, or long term fatigued, I don't know. It just feels stupid to invest time into training to then try to apply it to climbing with no results..

Edit: so far comments where very thought provoking and useful. I'll keep trying to improve and be patient. Thanks a lot!
How important are shoes? Shoes are probably one of the most important part of climbing, and cumulatively any climber should've spent the most money on them. That being said, how "important" are they? Is it reasonable to be able send something because you swapped your old shoes out for something "stickier"? Or are you just too weak? And your footwork is bad or you don't trust your feet enough?

The argument being if your shoes are not as good, you will be forced to try harder to have your feet stick on holds, and when you do wear good shoes you'll be in a much better position to use your foot.

However if you started with bad shoes, you might just end up not trusting your feet and pick up all kind of bad habits. As a result, is it always better to at least climb with fairly decent fairly sticky shoes? 

On a personal note my friend and I was doing the same route, and there's a heel hook Rockover which according to my friend with a mad rock drone felt very solid but to me in my climbx every single move felt like my foot is slipping away from the granite. We are on similar levels and I don't even know am I just weak or not trusting my feet or should I just change shoes.

Tldr: how important are sticky shoes? Can you blame your shoes or is it just another excuse for being weak.
Basic summaries of scientific reports related to climbing on instagram Hey! This isn't an advertisement but more of a passion project that I believe can help some people. I'm a currently studying a course in the anatomical sciences and I'm really interested in the anatomy of climbing due to a pre-existing love for the sport. I've been using my spare time recently to create digestible information from scientific literature and sports science textbooks and relate it  to the sport of climbing.

I obviously understand that my credentials are important for something like this, however I am not trying to be a coach with the account. It is just used to make information from the realm of sports science easy to access for climbers and the information is just objective reporting.

In saying all that, the account tag is @climbscience

Thanks all
Where do I go from here? tl;dr:   I'm a pretty okayish climber who just started training and saw a lot of progress and I'm now wondering if I can train more efficiently. Lot's of details in this post, but that is pretty much the gist of it.

I've never made any posts like this before, but I'm hoping some good climbers or possibly some coaches might be able to help me out here. Alternatively, if anyone could point me to a place where I can gain access to these resources, I am happy to pay (within reason) for an actual coach. All I can find is pre-scripted programs though, and I'm not really interested in that. I live in an area where there are no coaches (that I know of), and I am already among the best climbers I know. Anyone in N.Idaho/Spokane that can help me? That would be cool.

Anyway, here's me in a nutshell:

Age: 38 5'10" 130lbs

Climbing age: Basically my whole life, with periods of greater/lesser intensity due to life's circumstances.

Training age: 1 year? What is training exactly? I've climbed at the 5.12a/b level for over a decade, but have never really tried to get better. This seems to be a natural baseline for me just by virtue of having climbing as a part of my life for so long. I've kept myself in great physical shape, but have never done any climbing-specific training up until this last year. That is when I decided to devote some time to actual improvement. I bought a hangboard and a gym pass and started learning to try hard. I also improved my tactics (I had never actually had a "project" before- If I couldn't do something after 2 or 3 tries I'd just walk over to the next climb).

Current level: This year I have sent several 5.13as, two 13bs, and one 13c. All were projects. I am on-sighting the majority of anything 12b or easier. In bouldering, I have finally broken into double digits with two v10s, but both were probably soft. I on-sight or flash the majority of 7s and a large minority of 8s.

Current training: Weighted hangs. 4(6/10 x 6) +45lbs crimp (small edge on beastmaker 2000); +80lbs drag (larger edge). Weighted pullups 4(3-5) +80 on rings/+45 wide grip bar. Lots of playing around on the tension board. Basic fitness stuff (running, weight training, core, etc.). I try my best to actually get out and climb at least 2x/week, but I only try hard on one of those days. The other day is to keep things fun. Mostly on-sights or "quick" redpoints. I do think there is some benefit to this, as more routes leads to increased movement vocabulary and endurance. I think? Anyway- I love climbing and I don't want to burn myself out by prioritizing improvement over the experience itself.

Injuries: None to speak of. Like with most climbers, my shoulders/elbows/fingers will sometimes hurt, but a little rest has always brought things back to normal pretty quickly. I have good mobility and don't feel that there any abnormal limitations to how I can treat my body. I anticipate this will probably begin to change within the next 5-10 years due to wear and tear (age).

Questions: Where do I go from here? I have been so amazed at my own progress this year that it is super motivating! I don't know if grade increases are more from training or from changing tactics, but I am starting to think it would be pretty sweet to continue on this trajectory. I never thought I'd ever do a 13, and now 14 seems to be within reach!

One armed hangs? I can do them, but I feel I can add more weight with two, and finger strength is the goal with hangboarding, isn't it? Is there any benefit to going one-armed?

Campusing? I tried this for a while, but just felt like I got better at campusing without any real translation onto real rock. Big powerful problems on the tension board seem more applicable. Also, my elbows started hurting when I did a lot of campusing, and then stopped when I stopped, so I'm a little hesitant to go this route.

Training "tricks"? One armed pullups, front levers, etc. I can't do any of that stuff. Like, not even close. Is there any benefit to training these movements? I'm already married so I don't need to impress anyone :)

Keep doing what I am doing? I mean, it seems to be working, and I don't really feel like I am slowing down. I am just wondering if I can do things more efficiently with my limited time. Also, I'm not getting any younger here. At some point I'm going to hit a ceiling. I don't think that will be soon, but it would be cool to see how high I can go, you know?

Alright- if anyone has made it this far, congratulations. I really don't know if this is even the right place to be putting so much out there. But if anyone has real advice, I'd love to hear it. I don't subscribe to the idea that there is one "right" way to train, but I am sure that there are ideas out there that I have not considered.

Thank you!
England Lockdown training plan. Advice? Hi everyone, so England is back into national lockdown from Thursday, so I wanted to create a training plan to get strong! All thoughts/advice are welcomed :)

Background: Been climbing around 3 years, mostly indoor bouldering, but started outdoor bouldering in March. Sent a couple of V6s outdoors and loads of V6s indoors. Want to train to improve my bouldering for the most part.

Goals: improve deadhang finger strength, pinch strength, core strength, balance and hip mobility

Equipment available: 17mm fingerboard, 20mm/70mm pinch block, pullup bar, gymnastic rings.

Routine:

Every day - hip and groin stretches, balance board

Monday - Max hangs, pinch block max 5 sec hangs

Tuesday - pull ups: variety of grip types, front lever practice

Wednesday - rest

Thursday - repeater fingerboard hangs, repeater pinch training

Friday - rest, front lever practice

Saturday - if weather good climb outside

Sunday - if weather good climb outside

If weather bad all weekend, do an additional pull up and front lever training session.

What do you guys think?
I miss climbing, I miss gyms being a crowded social place, I don't know what to do. I can't post this in r/climbing, and I didn't know where else to post it, so sorry if this doesn't belong here.

I've been climbing once since quarantine started, and beyond that I've had a surgery that caused me to lose a lot of weight. Because of this, I've lost all my muscle tone.

At the beginning of quarantine I was regularly using my hang board and pull-up bar, but I slowly realized that I don't care much to do those things if I can't use them for anything. I liked being fit, but it was more of a nice side effect of climbing rather than the goal of climbing. Climbing was my favourite thing ever not so long ago. It was my go to for recreation and stress relief, and now when I'm more stressed than I've ever been in a long time, I can't do it anymore.

Gyms have reopened here in Canada, and I went once, but it was such an uncomfortable situation that I couldn't bring myself to go again, especially with the cases on the rise again here. Climbing was more than a sport or a form of activity, too. It was an amazing social experience where you could connect with strangers and problem solve or just shoot the shit together, it was like a home away from home. Now it's so barren and isolated. And the whole situation made me uncomfortable.

I'm a bit at a loss here. What do I do going in to winter? I have a feeling gyms will be closing in my province again soon, and with cases on the rise I don't know that I'm comfortable going in even if they don't. 

What have other people been doing to cope? How can I get a least a little bit of the thing I loved so much back in to my life?
Climbing after recovering from COVID Has any of you contracted coronavirus? If so, how severe were the symptoms and how much time did you need to go back to your normal climbing form?

It's my 25th day counting back to the first symptoms (loss of smell and taste, great fatigue, problems with sinuses), I'm healthy and I can't complain except I still feel weak and tired. If I have to walk up the stairs or a hill I instantly lose my breath and when I try to climb (we're talking about climbing outdoors) I simply feel exhausted even on the easiest stuff. Hell, just getting to the crag feels like already too much. 

It's not even about the lack of strength, it's simply a matter of having no energy at all. To be honest, at this point I start to feel a bit discouraged - especially after reading about all those people who deal with the fatigue for months afterwards even if they previously had an active life - and I was wondering if any climber here has managed to go back to pushing the limits (and how soon) after dealing with the virus.

For reference: I'm 37 and a female.
Climbing and antidepressants I'm in my early 40s and been climbing about 3 years. I've a history of depression and have been on a combo of venlafaxine and mirtazapine all this time. Over the past 18 months I've reduced the mirtazapine dose from 45mg to 15mg. The higher dose definitely caused some weight gain but Ihave managed to reduce it on the lower dose.

Since I've reduced the dosage my strength has greatly improved although this is probably more to do with greater focus on training. My general energy levels have also improved significantly. 

More recently I've had to increase the dose to 30mg and possibly will go back to 45mg.

I'm worried that this will negatively affect my climbing. Anyone on here have experience with mirtazapine (alone or in combo with other drugs) and has it had an effect on your climbing?

PS if mods are looking at this I am definitely NOT seeking medical advice or recommendations on other meds or pathways
Finger Stops Hurting Only After I Warm Up? Recently when I have been going climbing, before and when I am warming up, it feels as if I have a pulley injury and it hurts (the pain is bearable - nothing too extreme). But once I am fully warmed up, I do not feel any more pain in the finger. I can limit boulder on small crimps and my finger will feel completely fine.

Has anyone else had experiences like this? Do you think I should take a break from climbing, to prevent any further risks? I can provide more information if needed. Any insights would be appreciated.
Flexibility: getting that leg higher on the side Hi folks. I have been working hard on flexibility for the last three months and I've made some gains, particularly in doing the splits and getting a high toe in-front for top-outs and the like. However, when I was on the wall today, I found that I still have trouble getting my toe up high on the side, as seen in this high-res photograph of the climb:

https://preview.redd.it/tiuvow9u9wx51.png?width=556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12ca9e562eb54d6f72895f324aa05514f8e6080a

I'm curious what specific stretches you'd recommend for this movement. I have been doing some stuff to open up my hips:

* Yoga squats.
* Cow-Face Pose.
* Pigeon pose.
* Pulling my leg directly up in front of my chest.
* And I lie on my back with my feet touching and my knees pointing outwards.

None of this seems to be helping too much on getting mobility going on the sides. Ideas?
Does training different energy systems increase potential strength capacity? A pitfall I often run into when thinking about training is that I dont want to spend "recovery points" on submaximal higher volume training, because if my goal is to primarily climb 3-8 move boulders I want to make sure my recovery is spend on strength and power. But the question of (edit)overall capacity definitely comes to mind as well as overtraining one system leading to strength ceiling plateau. Though it would appear a lot of people specifically train near maximal in low volume with ample recovery for long periods of time. Do I need to switch up my intensities and volumes with my current goals, will this lead to strength loss or potential gains by training more diversely and less overall at a strength intensity/volume?

Also a similar question for power. You train this at lower loads and higher velocities right? So pullups for example, should I do these unweighted or just at a lower % of maximal? Would you train only power or strength in a given movement pattern per session? How do you work this in while maintaining strength, and does it have an effect on strength gains? How long does it take to get power adaptations/how close do you train to a performance day to have an effect? Im assuming power is more similar to endurance than strength in that it comes and goes more quickly and should be trained more precisely time-wise. Is power training's recovery time the same, less, or more than strength training?
Does anybody else feel nauseaus when super pumped? I wanted to say sick instead of nauseaus, but I figured you could read that differently.

Today I really pushed myself while climbing, becoming super pumped, to the point where I felt a bit sick. I get this pretty often when really fighting hard on a route, it feels like a mild fever. I'm not looking for a solution, just wondering whether more of you guys have this. :)
Do you have sessions where you just seem to suck? I'm in training season, currently on a limit bouldering day. I just can't seem to do anything even remotely hard. My flash grade is not even climbable for me today. It's not like the moves are too hard or I'm too sore, I just can't seem to generate the power or coordinate my body properly. I'm banging my knees and elbows on everything, smacking holds with my knuckles. I'm falling off of stuff I've done many times before. 

So frustrating. Obviously, climb through it. But man, does it kill my mental for the session. I can't even really get a workout or a pump cause I'm not doing full climbs and then ones I can do are super easy jug hauls.

Edit: thanks for all the info and letting me know I'm not the only one who gets these days. Ended up being one of my better training days once I pushed past the mental and managed to get my body to be coordinated again! 

Obviously I wouldn't ever climb through physical fatigue, I would cut the session and probably just train mobility and core. But mental fatigue, I make a note to not just give in to the bad days where I feel like I suck and climb through them. Usually ends up with me back at pique or almost pique by the end.
Survey on Measuring Climbing Performance Hey everyone, I am conducting a research on how climbers currently measure their climbing performance, their training habits, and the tools they use in this process. I will share the results on r/climbharder as soon as I gather some good data. The survey should take about 5 minutes to complete. Thanks in advance for the help! Here is the survey link:

An Ode to Training: My Progress with my first year of training after 8 years of 'just climbing' I sent my season project yesterday (The Invasion, 5.12d in Cowell, AR), my first of the grade.  This prompted me to have a look at the last year of sends and I am noticing a big difference that I would like to share.  humblebrag, maybe, but more I just want to get people psyched. TL;DR training works.

Background: climbing 9 years.  first 2 years I only bouldered.  Started tying in with solid bouldering strength (V5-V6), but had no endurance.  Focus slowly switched to sport and trad, sport has been my focus perhaps the last 3 years, with plenty of bouldering and trad mixed in.

Training Background: mostly just climbing in the gym with little structure.  About 3 years ago, I started doing endurance specific hangboard stuff, as well as some pyramids or power endurance stuff "here and there" but nothing really structured.  No calisthenics, no ab work, no cardio.  Most of the time I spent just working projects I had in the gym.  Then my outdoor days had no structure either, usually just warm up, try my project a couple of times, call it a day.  Never hangboarded for finger strength.

Grades background:  I sent my first 12a in 2014, then my first 12b in 2015.  From 2014 through 2019, I sent a total of 15 routes graded 12a or 12b (10x 12a; 5x 12b). I had never sent 12c or harder.

2020 sends: In 2020 alone I have now sent 10 unique 5.12s (2x 12a; 1x 12b; 6x 12c; 1x 12d).  I sent my first 12c in April, and sent my first 12d yesterday.  Just from this year, my 5.12 total increased 66% and effectively took me from 12b to 12d in a year.

This year of training:  This year I decided to follow a training routine and start lifting weights, doing calisthenics, cardio, the whole 9.  I am following Steve Bechtel's "Logical Progression" plan (level 1/2) and Jim Wendler's 5-3-1 powerlifting routine.  I've continued doing my hangboard endurance, started doing Bechtel's power endurance stuff, and started doing the ladder protocol on the hangboard for strength, and having a structured 'limit bouldering' session.  Started tracking macros, eating a bit healthier (though i was already eating pretty healthy) started using protein powder and other supplements.  I have followed it pretty strictly all year, taking a rest week ever 5-6 weeks, and took a lot of the month of July off.  Have also been climbing outside about every other weekend.  That is something I liked about Bechtel's plan, it is very flexible for the outdoor climber.  I run a short distance (0.5-1 mile) basically every day.  I rice bucket every day that I climb. On rest days I do light mobility and stretches, all of which I never did in the past besides maybe yoga once a month.

Mentality shift:  The idea of the progression pyramid really stuck, as well as treating your outdoor sessions with a little more structure.  Instead of just projecting my hardest route all day, I would try it once when i was fresh, then move on to easier climbs I hadn't tried before.  I started knocking out all the 5.11s I had been neglecting, started building my confidence with 5.11+ I didn't want to fail on.  If my outdoor day fell on the 'power endurance' day of my training cycle, I would seek out routes that were more power endurance-y.  if it was recovery or long endurance day, I would climb longer routes.  The mentality was that after the hard try on my project, the rest of the day was just more training.  Building this base of routes improved my confidence and just my ability to climb all day.  I read the Rock Warrior's Way, which also really improved my mentality and mental focus.

No real goal with this post, just proud of my progression and my ability to finally stick with a program.  I've felt pretty plateaued for years, and am finally breaking through.   I'd be happy to answer any specifics you might have, but otherwise just stay psyched and stick with it! Training works!

Big thanks to this sub too.  Self coaching and building a proper training program almost feels like you have to be an athlete, physical trainer, physical therapist, psychologist, etc. all at the same time, so a resource like this is invaluable.
Mental Illness and Climbing Throwaway because privacy reasons...

I've been climbing for over 10 years now, and have had noticeable depression and anxiety for around 5 years now. I was recently diagnosed and have started seeing a councilor, which prompted me to finally write this post. To some degree, depression has always informed my climbing, and vice versa. When I climb well or just sent something hard, I will feel that ever too fleeting euphoria. However, if I'm in a slump or plateau I feel angry and frustrated, often so much so it greatly inhibits my ability to climb at all.

About a month back I had a pretty disappointing climbing trip, and something in me sort of snapped. Due to other factors in my life, climbing is one of the few things that brings me any pleasure. I realized at this point if I want to see actual improvement, I have to invest much more concerted effort into getting stronger and better, it won't just happen by accident any more. Twelve sessions later I'm climbing harder than I ever have in my life, but the mental strain of climbing at my limit is still incredibly difficult. Does anyone with mental illness have experience with managing the mental aspect of climbing performance? I suppose I'm less asking how I overcome my mental weaknesses to send harder, but how to better accept positive or unfavorable outcomes with equanimity.



Edit:

Thank you all so much for your thoughtful responses and advice. I'm glad we can have an open discussion about mental health in this community, especially in a sport that demands so much mental exertion. I'll try to get around to responding to as many comments as I can, but I just want to say I appreciate everyone who took the time to write something. It seems many of you have faced similar challenges I have.

Some main takeaways:

1) Decouple your sense of self worth from sending a certain grade. Pushing yourself and achieving a goal is great, but it should not determine whether or not you see yourself as a success or a failure.

2) Look at success and failure objectively, and don't immediately impart judgement. Understand that climbing performance does not relate to progress, and take a step back and look at the big picture. Perhaps you didn't send today, but you made two ne links and figured a slightly easier beta for the crux. There's a quote from Ethan Pringle in a video of him climbing [The Nest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELiQBQt2Kdc) where he says you only really fail if you give up. Maybe the correct decision is to walk away for a while and come back later. Failure is an unavoidable aspect of climbing. Framing it in the right context is imperative. 

3) Anxiety over climbing performance is likely one facet of a greater issue. Seriously looking into how mental illness affects your life and seeking treatment options could be the best thing you could do. Setting a routine, practicing self care, seeking the help of a councilor, meditating, or starting medication can all be effective options for improving your life as a whole, which could carry over into climbing.
Getting started as a bouldering coach Hey all,

I've been bouldering (and climbing) on and off for about 15 years or so. It's pretty much been a focal point in my life and a source of joy and all that. I love introducing newbies to the sport and watch new climbers progress. 

So a thought formed in my head. Why not take that to the next level and get into a more "formal" coaching role. The thing is, that I do not really know how to get started with it. I imagine it takes more than an  enthusiasm for the sport. There must be certain things you must know and skills to acquire. 

What are the skills and how would you go about acquiring those skills?

I've done some googling ofcourse and only found some very broad tips; such as being a communicator and knowing how to move and such things. Some specifics would be appreciated if anyone here knows.

In my area there is not much oppurtunity for climbing outdoors or even top roping in a gym, but there is a very cool boulder gym. So my question is really about coaching bouldering. I wouldn't be looking to gain any compensation from it (if it matters) just maybe to spend the Sunday afternoon explorering the joy of climbing with a bunch of people.   


Hope this question fits the community

Hope my question is clear

Hope anyone can give some pointers  


Thanks! VDV
Isometric vs concentric core exercises Hey all.

Science shows that in general for strength training, concentric (the target muscles contract) exercises are better than isometric (muscles do not move). Pull-ups, campus boarding, these are both concentric exercises.

As climbers we also do some isometric training. In general, isometric training is inferior to concentric as it does not strengthen the muscles over the full range of motion. However, dead hangs are an example of isometric training. This applies because climbers do not use the full range of our forearms often; typically we are open, half, or full crimping. The positives of isometric hangboarding is that the strength gains apply very well to climbing since it replicates it so closely, the downside is that we may have to train different grip types separately.

But there's another world where isometric exercises are the norm, and I don't understand why. That is the world of core exercises. Planks, side planks, one arm/one leg, these exercises are isometric. This seems like a terrible idea -- why would we want to train the body to be good at planks and neglect the remaining range of motion in our core?

As climbers specifically, do isometric core exercises make sense? If so, why? Which ones? What specific moments in climbing do these apply on the wall?

And if concentric core exercises make more sense for climbers, does anyone have any recommended exercises or full workouts for concentric core strength building?
Finally after a weeks of giving my spare time to this project it's done! I have created a way to log hangboarding and strength training in my app. I've never really liked using a logbook so really solving my own problem but hopefully it might help someone else, so I really wanted to share it :) Android only I'm afraid 😬

Retro Flash; This app i‘ve been working on for over a year. (Spray Wall App) Hey There,

so i have been working on this app for quite a while now. Right now we are in the Beta Phase and looking for testers. Retro Flash is a Spray Wall App that allows you to upload your home wall for free and set climbs on it, log sends and use a lot of useful features.

We are focusing more on making this app useful for climbing gyms atm, as we hope to support gyms with Retro Flash by making their Spray Walls more accessible without the need of having any additional costs. This will hopefully cause more customers to climb at the gym, once lockdowns are over.

We also offer an Upgrade for walls, which offers the best possible setting experience and adds a few more features like adding rules to holds you set(for example: math, zone, left hand..).

I would be happy if you could test the app, but more importantly, i would be happy if Retro Flash is useful to you as a training tool! 

You can find the app here:

Breathing during hard moves I have known for a while that i don't breath properly while climbing and yesterday someone pointed it out to me again. It seems to be mostly on hard moves but I notice i hold my breath. I know this is an issue other people have had to deal with so how have you guys over came this problem?

Are there some breathing practices you've done?
Should I just so slightly less challenging boulder problems and focus more on proper breathing?

Also should breathing be consistent through a whole climb? Like in running for example while running long distances my breathing is really consistent.

How much will better breathing really change my ability to climb harder, i imagine quite a bit.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Iontophoresis instead of Methenamine solutions for sweaty skin. I'm a lurker, but god damn the stoke is high. I've climbed for 6-7 years and struggled with soft sweaty skin for the entire time. I've used antihydral and rhino skin for a good chunk of those years, but as a lot of people here know, it takes a lot of of upkeep and timing: avoiding the joints, letting it dry, wearing gloves at night (which my partner hates), is my skin too thick/thin to reapply, cutting calluses off, sanding. If I applied it regularly enough to have the desired effect, my skin almost always got too thick and started chunking off.   

I didn't think there was an alternative until someone mentioned Iontophoresis in a comment thread. You put your palms in a water bath for 20min while a little machine runs an electric current through your hands once a day 5x a week for 3-4 weeks. Once you get a result you like you're supposed to be able to start a "maintenance phase" where you only have to treat yourself 1-2 times a week. It kind of feels like sticking your tongue on a 9v battery, but on the palms of your hands ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5531963/)). 

The machine's expensive ($470 and a prescription from an online dermatologist), but two weeks into the treatments and my sweating is down probably 85-90% (100% being absolutely no sweat). I actually have some nice strong and flexible skin starting to grow on my tips for the first time without hard glassy areas and excessive callus build up from the Methenamine. 

Yep it's expensive, I can't deny that ($200 shoes anyone?), and no I haven't tested it long term yet; but the results I've already gotten have got me psyched. No, I don't think that it's for everyone, but I grease off 10s max hangs without some kind of drying treatment. I'm interested to see how it compares to Methenamine for hot weather climbing, and how dry things will stay during the maintenance phase. There's probably still a use for Methenamine if all I wanted to do was build some callus in the short term for a trip; but for general long term sweating and not being a pain in the ass, Iontophoresis might be the ticket.

I hope this helps somebody.

TLDR: For me, Iontophoresis is looking like a better long term treatment for sweaty skin instead of Methenamine (Rhino, Antihydral, etc).
Your opinion on The Climbing Bible by M. Mobråten and S. Christophersen? For those that have read the "The Climbing Bible: Technical, physical and mental training for rock climbing" by Martin Mobråten and Stian Christophersen, how did you like it?

The presentation looks great, but I am in the dark on its content. The book seems relatively beginner oriented, and I was wondering how it compares to e.g. 9 out of 10 and other books.

For me personally beginner oriented content is still interesting (only climbed a bit over a year). But I already own 9/10 and MoB, and there is a lot of good (free) beginner information online, so I am wondering what (if any) additional value I would find in this book.
Best excercises for the climbing focused climber I am a relatively new, relatively weak boulderer (tried the moonboard for the first time yesterday, and struggled very much on the easiest problems).

For this reason my main focus is of course on "just climb". I would, however, like to do some other excercise after my climbing training.

So far my focus is mainly on injury prevention and therefore antagonist excercises.

I bench, overhead press, dip, do rotator cuff excercises with bands, do face pulls, do wrist curls and reverse wrist curls and eccentric rotation excercises.

Besides these, however, which excercises gives the best bang for your buck? I am especially interested in core excercises, as I am not sure knee raises are working for me.

Besides core, I suspect that weighted deadhanging from a hangboard is good? And pull-ups? As I said the primary focus is injury prevention, but the long term goal is obviously to get stronger!
I'm surprised about the rate at which I'm losing finger strength when I don't hangboard In September, I was adding +7.5 lbs on a 18 mm semi-closed crimp (no thumb). Then in October, I dedicated the month entirely to hard bouldering. This week I started a new strength phase on the hangboard only to find out that I can barely make it on the same hold by removing -5 lbs when in reality, I was expecting to be even stronger due to the hard bouldering!

Everything is exactly the same as in September: my bodyweight, the hangboard and the friction quality. I'm also not overtraining since I took a week off between my last bouldering session and my first hangboard session.

Am I missing something or are my fingers really weaker despite the hard bouldering?
More Power and Strength for bouldering. I would like to gain more power and strength . I am female and short. I realize my weakness in explosive power. When I moonboard or boulder, I lack the explosive power to jump high enough and push hard enough for those reachy holds/ one move wonders. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have thought about doing:

Power:  route campusing, power pull ups, learning how to muscle ups . 

Strength (body strength): weighted pull ups, one hand pull up progression. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear your thoughts. I would like to keep it simple.


Edit: about my strength/power... I can do MB V4. Feel stuck on V5. Max pull up 1rep 145%. I can do 1-4-5 but not 1-4-6 on campus. 
I am a long time route climber so tend to climb very statically outdoors. 
I basically just moonboard if I gym climb. (1-2x a week for 60 min)
Tension between keeping the hips close to the wall and hanging with straight arms? I have been climbing for about a year, and this might be noob question, but there are two core rules of climbing that sometimes seem to be in tension for me.

I am a somewhat tall climber (6"0´) and it would seem that staying close to the wall sometimes limits the distance between footholds and handholds so that hanging with straight arms (in order not to engage the biceps as much) becomes more difficult?

Is this a correct assesment? What to do about it, and which rule to prioritize?
How long did it take/how many sessions did you spend on your longest project? Curious to get a sense of how hard/how light people go with the projecting process. Also curious to hear people’s thoughts on projecting and why they do what they do. If you have a climb that you’re still working on I’d like to hear about it too....spray as much as you want/share footy/etc.
Making varied board problems/ addressing weaknesses? So I'm climbing on a board frequently at the moment, setting hard projects that I'm working for a while with progressively smaller foot holds. I'm not very systematic with my projects however, just making up random hard boulders that I find fun. I'm looking to structure my board sesh more.

I've realized I don't actually know what my weaknesses are. How do you guy's structure your board problems, and find out your weaknesses. I'm looking to compile a list of varies types of movements relevant to steep board climbing, to include in my board problems. In the hopes of making them more varied and address weaknesses. Has anyone got a minute to give me some suggestions of types of movements too work, or some random suggestions. I've looked around but couldn't find much.

Thanks!
Post-covid pump I had a very mild case of Covid a couple of months ago. Just before my infection I was in great shape and had just spent a week alpine climbing, hiking and even did an unsupported mountain marathon. I was only ill for 24 hours but spent 10 days in isolation. After my infection I was extremely tired but got back to training as soon as I was allowed. 

Strengh wise I notice no difference. My hangs, lifts and max boulder have actually improved. But my route climbing is way way below what it used to be. I get extremely pumped even on easy routes. This was something I noticed just before getting ill (before any ”real” symptoms) and it hasn’t improved at all even though I’ve climbed lots of routes both on rock and plastic. 

I’m not sure how my cardiovascular fitness has changed after covid. But I’m guessing there could be a connection between decreased cardivascular capacity (which is well documented even after mild cases) and my ability to recover and shake the pump. 

I’m curious if anyone else is experiencing the same thing and how you have adjusted your training.
Dave Mcloud tries Carnivore diet (Improved eczema and strength) https://www.instagram.com/p/CHzkX-ODwrI/?igshid=1949r0q3alxmz

&gt;I’m exactly four weeks into another diet experiment, this time my second round of carnivore diet (my first was in 2018). I’m doing it to test a very specific outcome. I’ve had severe eczema all my life which affects my feet. I was hospitalised as a kid for it and spent a bit of time unable to walk at times. Pain, itch, broken, bleeding skin and resulting infection and topical steroid medication has been a constant part of my life since then. I basically cringed every single time I put on or took of rock shoes, with pain.

&gt; However, in that first carnivore experiment, my eczema unexpectedly disappeared completely, for the duration of the diet. It also disappeared completely during the prolonged fasts I’ve done (but obviously they are necessarily temporary). So I obviously had to repeat the carnivore experiment.
&gt; 
&gt; This time around, the same thing has happened, the eczema just stopped by the second day and is 100% gone. In due course I’ll need to reintroduce some favoured plant foods one at a time to monitor for specific foods or ingredients that provoke symptoms. I’ve done baseline bloods and will have another round of bloods after another month or two. More on that in a video soon.But a nice additional side effect has been that I feel really strong. I’ve just been trad climbing and with only 6 or 7 fingerboard/board sessions since June. I should be really weak. But I could just step straight on the fingerboard and break my PBs on all grip types, first try. Excellent!

Cold Weather Comfort Whose got the beta for dealing with cold weather bouldering? I can't stand being freezing. I've got hand warmers and long johns but I want something next level. Think down slippers sized up to fit over your climbing shoes.
The Lattice Lite Plan log - 5 week check in! Hey all, here's the first follow up to [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/jjz1ca/i_started_a_lattice_lite_plan_heres_some/) although admittedly slightly belated; my life has been pretty hectic. I'm going to jump straight to the chase, as I feel that I gave the necessary context to what I'm doing here in my first post, but for a short summary to anyone new:

* started a Lattice Lite Plan 5ish weeks ago, and am now about to enter my 6th week. the intention with this is pretty much to just to present in an objective light whether I can see any changes in my climbing ability through the course of a lite plan, especially comparatively to previous training I structured on my own since these fuckers are expensive. For any more context, I guess see the first post, although none if it's terribly important.

With that out of the way, I guess now for the actual progress report! If you aren't interested in what is essentially going to be humble bragging and somewhat vague talk about what I've been doing with my plan (due to confidentiality stuff), the jist of this post is that my climbing fitness has definitively improved already, even just being 1/3 of the way through my full plan. Sick! For a bit more on why/what I've been doing,

Improvements:

* The weekend after the first post of this series, I was able to pull the crux on a 5.12b that I'd consider pretty stiff, probably around outdoor v5/6, that I previously was completely unable to do around a month before and had to bail on. This was a pretty significant initial indicator to me, as although I did receive some better beta, the crux move itself still remains extremely strength/core tension dependent, to a degree where it was a noticeable shift just to be able to get to the chains with (relative) ease rather than bailing off the crux permadraw.
* Right at the 4 week mark, I sent my first moonboard v6, which felt equally huge as the largest deficit that Lattice noted immediately in my profile and even I was aware of before was max power. Steep climbing with large moves is definitely among my weakest links along with bad friction slopers, and so jumping from barely being able to do moonboard v5 to most 5s feeling doable in a few tries, and getting one 6 solidly and nearly sending another, I would absolutely call that visible improvement.
* I can somehow finally hold front lever for a couple (2-3) seconds! Granted, still not my goal of 5 with good form, but also a serious improvement from essentially only being able to hold one for around a half-second!
* And finally, yesterday I reached a massive new highpoint on a hard 12a project, putting me less than 20 moves below the chains and past the first crux, which feels enormous. My endurance has genuinely never been better, as this climb specifically is a great fitness test being completely sustained from start to finish with no stopper moves, but no moves easier really than v2. Woo!

What I'm doing:

* As stated in my previous post, since the plan isn't necessarily periodized, the way I've been breaking up my weeks is essentially power drills and some conditioning on Mondays, endurance on Tuesdays, and hangboard stuff and power endurance on Thursday with weekends open for climbing and some stretching interspersed throughout the week, which has been really good thus far.
* Although the overall areas of focus of each exercise seem to be the same for this next 4-week block as the previous one, the exercises themselves (up until now, will explain at the end) still managed to evade redundancy by at least to some degree being mixed up in the equipment used, exact muscle groups targeted, intervals, and type of climbing required. This definitely has kept me super motivated, as no two weeks have felt identical, which at least for me is definitely a positive.
* Due to the interchanging drills, I feel that my overall fitness is improving in a relatively proportional sense, in that my endurance is finally relatively close to my finger strength, and hopefully by the end of this plan my power endurance and overall strength are closer as well.

The caveat here is that due to living in Oregon, my state just entered a "two-week pause," meaning that my local gym is closed. Despite this being a bit of a hinderance, Lattice has been really helpful in getting my climbing-based exercises converted to hangboard/bar drills, and I plan to also use some outdoor bouldering days as a way to still do some of the climbing exercises as well, weather and covid restrictions permitting, as my semester has essentially ended.

That's all for now, I suppose, as there's not much more to update on. I'll probably do my next follow up in a couple weeks, as if things don't completely fall apart I'm planning on doing a climbing trip (local, with only housemates), which should coincide with a de-load week, and should be a good next chance to check-in on progress. That said, who knows with everything going on. Wishing you all good health and the best through this next rough patch of lockdowns and case increases; this too shall pass, and more hangboard training is never a bad thing, even if a bit arduous.
V4/5 climber here. Can't hang bodyweight on 20 mm edge, how to progress? Hi there,

I've been climbing for two years, getting the odd V5 and fairly comfortable getting V4s in 5-10 goes or so.

I can't hang my bodyweight even for a second from a 20 mm edge, my intuition is that this is weak for the grade and I'm compensating elsewhere. 

I'm fine on a 40 mm edge and trying to gradually add weight. Currently at 60 kg BW, 6 kg added.

Is this the right approach? Add weight on a big edge until I can hang 20 mm? And am I right that this is weak for the grade? Thanks!
Moonboard 2016 progression video playlist, or how I learned to stop worrying and love the board. Following the trend of home woodies, lack of access to gyms, and COVID/winter training, I built a moonboard. I was very hesitant to get one because in previous attempts to use it I would either fail spectacularly or barely get to climb anything, but ultimately I thought of that as motivation to try and get better.

The first times I used it I could finish one or two problems max, and maybe link two or three moves in other problems. It felt extremely hard. But the thing was built and it was there taunting me every day, so I had no choice but to keep trying.

I thought it'd be useful to share my process in case anyone else is struggling with starting on the board. This is an ongoing process, but I'm uploading videos of problems I can complete here:

[playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf7mAiDmZjUM5qWxyfVenkq3SUcNnEKjU)

A few notes on my board:

* The feet only has a single row of "standard" (upper) holds, and the rest are scattered below that one. This was to save space and fit the board in the basement.
* The top-most row of holds are "switched" with the top-most row of LEDs. Same reason as above.
* The rest remains standard.

Overall I don't think it changes the problems much, save some of them feeling pretty scrunched at the bottom.

My Moonboard user name is "peicou" and I'm keeping the logbook updated if anyone is interested in what I think is the path of least resistance to start using this training tool.
Treating RED-S in female climbers Hi everyone!

About a year ago, Mina Leslie-Wujastyk published [this article](https://www.ukclimbing.com/articles/features/relative_energy_deficiency_in_sport_-_a_cautionary_tale-12345) about her experience with RED-S (relative energy deficiency in sport), and she’s been pretty vocal about the challenges in recovery and returning to climbing.

Now, I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar story, or can speak about their experiences. It’s clearly such a prevalent issue for women in our sport, and something I’m realizing I’ve been struggling with as well, so I’m a little confused about why I feel like I haven’t seen many similar stories (from pros or just people at my gym). It seems like plenty of people look back and say “yeah, I had a problem,” but it’s been harder to find concrete steps they took to get out of it.

Most of all, this is pretty broad, but does anyone have advice?
Is it more effective to climb on a home wall a few times a day in short bursts, or keep it to 1 longer session? Got a home wall, looking to maximize gainzz and minimize injury risk.

Edit: I’m blown away by all the great advice, thanks all! Some other factors I hadn’t mentioned are that my time is quite limited for longer sessions (kids) and I’ve been climbing on and off for about 12 years. 

Considering all the advice, my plan is to do 2 micro sessions a day on Monday and Thursday. Then one longer intense session on Saturday. I’ll add more days in the new year as I adapt to the intensity. (40 degree overhang wall). I’ll update on how it goes!
Coaching from the Pros I've been seeing a few pros on instagram (Puccio, Matt Fultz, Paul Robinson, ...) opening up spots for their individual coaching and personal training programs, and I was wondering if anyone here has actually signed up for it? I'd be curious to hear how it's turned out for them and if they think it's worth the increased price compared to something like Lattice or PPC?
I have noticed I have this tendency of dragging my feet like in vid, especially when I have very bad handholds/other foot is in a high-step position. I wonder why this might be and how to minimise/mitigate this. Thanks [deleted]
Hangboard protocol summaries Hey!

Whilst doing a lot of research on hangboarding and hangboard protocols, I've found it can get kind of overwhelming. Therefor, I've tried to make summaries for the most popular hangboard protocols, in an attempt to make it more digestible for climbers less familiar with them.

You can also view and download the summaries (PDF + PNG) on [tenso.app/protocols](https://tenso.app/protocols.html)

Please let me know if you feel there's room for improvement or if you'd like to see another protocol summarized.

Hope this is valuable!

How do you train your shoulders for dyno catches? I believe I have a bit of a weakness with catching reachy dynos where my arms are extended.

I can catch dynos just fine if I can overshoot and catch in a bent elbow position and with my scaps engaged. However, I can't catch them in an extended position. Last time I tried one of these moves, not only did I fail to do it, I developed some upper bicep/front deltoid pain that took me 2 weeks to recover from. How does one go about training (either on the wall or off the wall) for the shoulder and contact strength to catch these types of dynos?
Passive hang position Why is it considered dangerous to use a hangboard in a passive hang while doing deadhangs from a bar is said to be beneficial for shoulder mobility and posture?
Looking for advice on how to identify my weaknesses and move forward with my climbing? Ok so I hope this doesn't end up being too long of a post but I'll start with some background-


Female, 5'5" 120ish lbs. I've been climbing consistently (ie a least 1-2 times week, usually 3-4 times though) for about 5.5 years. Only a handful of 1-3 month long breaks due to injuries. 


So i started out as more of a sport climber for the first 3.5 years of climbing, only really bouldering inside but didn't care much about bouldering outside. The past 1.5 years I've been more drawn to bouldering outside rather then sport climbing because I have found that I love being able to push myself to my physical limit on boulder problems and see progress. 


Myself and my boyfriend just moved to central Oregon 3 months ago and have been (until 2 weeks ago when we went back into lockdown) consistently bouldering inside (3 times a week for 2 hours each session) the very nice gym we have here as well as a bit of training and then trying to get outside and boulder as much as we can on our days off. I have found myself progressing with my indoor bouldering and felt like i was getting stronger in the past 3 months, sending a couple of V6s and getting V5s in the gym much quicker then when we first moved here. I thought great, this might translate to getting better outside but so far I feel defeated and frustrated that I am still stuck projecting V3-4 outside, and have yet to send anything above a V2 (which I usually send after 2-5 tries) since moving to Oregon. Previously in CO where we lived I sent my first couple of V4s outside this summer and was usually able to send most V3s I tried after a few sessions. 

So I guess my question is, am I expecting too much progress too soon? Am i getting caught up in the trap of comparing indoor grades to outdoor grades (i know the gym we climb at is soft even for a most gyms)? The rock here is very different then what I am used to in Colorado (it's all volcanic tuff and basalt in Oregon) but I've been bouldering and sport climbing at least a dozen times if not more in the past three months so I thought I was more used to it by now. 

I've been projecting this particular V3 for the past two weeks (split over 3 sessions) and today was my last chance to send before the road closes for the winter but I did not get the send. I wanna take something away from my failure to work on this winter but I truly don't know how to correctly identify my weaknesses when my failures feel like things I don't know how to train for. The rock here is sharp but somehow very slippery at the same time and it seems like moving past the hard moves is just- how long can i hold onto this fucking sharp crimp before my fingers can't take it anymore? how can i keep my body so tense that my foot won't slip? 

I apologize if this is a bit ramble-y and not cohesive, I just am determined to work on my weaknesses and come back stronger then ever next Spring but I'm also feeling so discouraged after today. Every problem that I fail on and am trying to project seems so vastly different in terms of what I need to work on (fingers/feet slipping, not being able to keep my body tense, blindly throwing for a hold i can't see at all, not being able to pinch or crimp a hold for long enough to move off it because it's just fucking painful)
Supposed to do 2-5-7 but not able to get to 7. Doesn't feel like I am able to push off lower hand... any advise or suggestions? Thanks!
A Training Philosophy of Leaving Boxes Unchecked Certainly this is not a new training philosophy and I don’t claim any of these ideas as my own, as they’re too simple and straightforward to be any one person’s. However, I’ve seen so many posts recently of training plan critiques, exercise recommendations, recovery tool ideas and the like, so it seemed to me this could perhaps be a positive contribution.

The training philosophy is simple: leave as many “boxes” unchecked as possible until you truly need to check one in order to improve. This doesn’t necessarily mean it’s been 2 months since you sent a new grade, so you’re in a “plateau”. Improvement must be looked at on a much larger scale and is not directly linear in the short term, but that’s perhaps a different topic (that I would be really interested in a discussion on if anyone else is.)

So what is a ‘box’? In my mind, a ‘box’ is defined as a tool used for improving at rock climbing that isn’t directly rock climbing (i.e. diet, flexibility, strength training, hang boarding, core training, and anything else that isn’t directly climbing). 

Now that a box is defined, the major question is: are you improving? 

Again, I don’t mean in the span of two months (kudos if you are) - I mean year over year. In my mind, improvement should be the #1 metric. If that metric is met season over season, without checking any boxes, why check them? By leaving boxes unchecked, you allow yourself a less exhausted tool bag to pull from when you do encounter a real need. Mastery does not happen in two years - or three, or four, or five. Mastery in climbing (and anything in life, really) is about incremental improvement over a lifetime, so why exhaust all avenues at once if you don’t have to?  (If you love doing all of the other things, then do them. I don’t want to suggest anyone should stop doing what they truly enjoy.) 

Of course, this philosophy applies a bit more directly to newer climbers (&lt; 5 years), but can be applied to anyone. 

I’m interested in hearing other folks thoughts on this, so please let me know what you think.

TLDR: Are you improving by climbing? Keep doing that until you aren’t, then do as little more as possible until you’re improving again, and repeat for eternity.
I just watched Adams new video and noticed that he uses a a very specific grip positon to hold these crimps. It looks like a half crimp but with the thumb? I was wondering if any of you does this too and if it is even possible for everyone because it seems like you need a pretty flexible thumb.
Improving my clipping I have relatively little fear of falling when I'm sport climbing, but that is only true when I'm not clipping. I am not great at clipping and I have always found it the scariest part of lead climbing. I have fallen twice while clipping a quickdraw one inside once outside, both times it resulted in a 15ft+ whip which ended with me landing only 2 or 3 feet above the ground. I think my clipping ability is really holding my lead climbing skills back, I can do moves on all of these routes but then if I have to clip a quickdraw from a relatively unstable position I freeze up and cant do it. I really end up burning myself out and losing a substantial amount of energy when going to clip. I can usually climb low to mid 5.12s. Any advice on how to improve my clipping/clipping head game?
I built an app to track climbing and bouldering sessions and do hangboard workouts: meet Quopi (iOS and Android) **TL;DR: I built an app to track your climbing and bouldering sessions and hangboard workouts. Check it out in the** [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/quopi/id1439696146) **and** [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quopi.quopi)**.**

Hi all,

The last couple of years I used to track my climbing and bouldering on a notes app on my phone. Regular things, such as date, grade and when I climbed outside also the name of the route and crag. But I missed some things, such as visualizing my progress over time, or adding a nice photo. Hence I started building an app: [Quopi](https://quopi.com/).

Over time Quopi has evolved to an app to log your climbing and bouldering sessions, strength workouts and hangboard trainings. The app contains some climbing related exercises and a couple of standard hangboard protocols, but you can easily create your own. You can spice up your activities by uploading some photos, share them with friends, and follow your friend's activities if you’d like.

As said, I created Quopi to scratch my own itch. Currently a couple of my friends also use the app to track their climbing performance and do their hangboard training. They’re enthusiastic, so I thought others might enjoy it as well. The app is free to use.

I hope you guys like it. Let me know what you think in the comments below. Feedback, suggestions or other remarks are more than welcome.
Climbing Training Habits Survey for University Research (also "free" gear!) Howdy! 

A friend and I are both university students working on climbing training habits. We're really interested in how people go about training technique and how important training technique is. 

I've heard lots of climbing coaches, and other people in general say that newer climbers focus a lot on getting really strong but not so much on their technique. 

We also have a concept technique trainer that we're using as a way to get people thinking more about how they might be able to train climbing technique more efficiently!

We'd love to hear your thoughts and share the results of the survey when we're finished. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the survey: [https://byu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_6KDDfZWp3bRCXoV](https://byu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6KDDfZWp3bRCXoV)

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any feedback for the survey (specifically if you are experienced in research and good give us some tips to make it easier for the survey takers) please reach out!

p.s. We have a some funds to buy one or two respondents a new pair of rock shoes, boulder pad, or climbing rope up to $200 in value.
Moonboard and injuries Hi guys,

Not new here but my first post. I'm climbing around 6C and been stuck in this grade for 1 year or 2. I started climbing 4 years ago and I've been on-off until a year and a bit ago. Pretty much after 6 months climbing I was doing 6B+, injuring, building back, etc.

I changed the way I climb, but both before the lockdown and 2 months ago, if I start climbing in the moonboard, I get a minor injury. I really don't know why, I have the strength and make the problems clean and with good technique, I warm-up properly and give max. 5 go per session to the moonboard problems.

I feel like my fingers are strong enough but my pulleys aren't, and I don't know how to manage that. Could it be also due to a lack of flexibility and being my tendons to tense? I watch out what I eat, hours of sleep, water (maybe I don't drink enough tho', trying to change it), and really try not to overtrain. After the last injury, taking it easy... went from 6A to 6C+ in 3 months, not giving more than 5 go to a problem per session if it had any crimp.

I read make or break and training for climbing (Hörst), and I'm seeing I do everything recommended. Still do not see the way to progress without literally breaking myself. Thanks in advance, cheers!  


UPDATE: Right after posting, went to the gym to try something, climb open hand and everything... 3 finger drag in a easy 6B+, lumbrical strain now. Seriously, why do I get so many small injuries? I guess I'll have to wait another week or two to climb.
barefoot climbing on steep woody Hi there. I'm training once a week (V6 max) at home on a steep woody (45°) quite like a tension board. I tried a few times to go barefoot and found it really interesting in terms of proprioception foot-wise. Do some of you train on boards barefoot ? would it be detrimental to proper footwork and technique or beneficial ?
Keeping endurance off the wall? With COVID I can really only climb once a week, and it’s an hour 30 minute drive because not a lot of outdoor spots. Basically just wondering if there are any simple things I can work on at home to keep endurance? I’ve never formally trained besides hangbording and some wall routines so I’m quite oblivious to training techniques off the wall. Especially for endurance.
At 18 seconds, my feet cut. I have trouble keeping that right toe on. This has happened three times and keeps me from completing the crux. Any suggestions on how I can stick that right foot the first time?
Here's a video with suggestions for handling frustration and expectations in climbing! Hope it is helpful for people who struggle with feelings of disappointment or frustration when things don't go as well as expected!
Speed climbing Many climbing gyms have a speed wall these days, either the official IFSC one or a custom one with different holds. Speed climbing is of course totally different from conventional route climbing - it's ultra-dynamical, very powerful and it's about trusting every move without even thinking of falling. Do some of you spend some time speed climbing? It feels like it could be a good way to teach yourself to be more explosive, especially for static lead climbers.
Anyone else just flat out ignoring injuries because climbing is the only thing getting you through lockdown? We're still in lockdown in the UK - leaving full lockdown for tier 2 measures means not much has changed for me other than the ability to socialize outside (In the UK in December - fun) and the fact that climbing gyms are open. I am a key worker that cannot work from home so climbing is the only thing that breaks up the monotony of 8 hours in the office and sitting on the sofa at home.

I tweaked my shoulder weeks ago climbing in the Peak District but honestly would rather just deal with the pain for now and take the rest period if/when climbing gyms are forced to shut again or I can actually do something other than sit outside or stand at the end of the driveway and chat to friends/family in frigid temperatures.

  
Edit: I'm getting a lot of feedback which I'm seriously thankful for - a lot of it is contradictory but the general consensus seems to be not to ignore the injury. I should probably clarify I'm not completely ignoring it, i'm resting it as much as possible and if/when I do climb it is incredibly light bouldering well below my flash grade, being sure to avoid any particularly shouldery moves. I am also going to go back to my physiotherapist who has diagnosed previous climbing injuries for me. Thanks all!
I’m looking for very similar slopers/open hand crimps to mount next to my hangboard? Alex told me they were some random “shit screw ons.” Any recommendations for this size/style would be great.
Losing steam at the end of the outdoor season. I wanted to make a post to share my experience this season and gauge others experience with this topic. This Fall season I had hopes of sending my first V10 and potentially sending more V9's (I did my first one last spring). I picked a V10, a V9/10, and a handful of V9 projects to work on. I also chose submax projects in the V8 to V8/9 range to work on the side and keep my motivation up. My V10 and V9/10 project only saw 2-3 days of effort each as they've been consistently wet so Ive focused more on the 8's and 9's to project. I ended up filling out my pyramid and firmly cementing myself as a V8 climber this season.  I stopped training full time at the end of September when the temperatures dropped here in New England and have intermittently done some max hangs since then; my  Max Bodyweight percentage has dipped from 150% to 144%. I decided to keep climbing until December and eek out as many outdoor days as possible before it snows more regularly. I've averaged 2 to 3 days outside a week with one to two days in the gym per week working on the energy systems not used outside projecting ( aerocap, power endurance, power, light core work). Outdoor climbing takes precedence for me when the weather is good. So, here's my question to you all: does anyone else notice a dip in motivation and performance toward the end of a climbing season? If so how do you stay motivated to try hard and climb outside or do you start training when this happens and ditch outdoor climbing? I managed to send 4 V8's in the month of October and have since been unable to climb more 8's and have stalled out on my V9 projects as far as progress goes. This has led to a severe drop in my motivation and I've started to believe that I'm not strong or skilled enough to climb at my limit (which I believe is around V9/10). I know that months of training guarantees you nothing in terms of performance but I still feel disenchanted after all my hard work training the past two years. Is this a symptom of focusing too much on grades and performance or a natural progression in one's climbing? Is it normal to have a performance dry spell like this? These are questions for next season as winter snow is starting to cover various crags and end the fall season here. I'm open to thoughts and feedback! For Context: I've been climbing 4.5 years, outdoor climbing 4 years, targeted training 2 years. 26 years old.

TLDR; Do you notice a dip in motivation and performance towards the end of an outdoor climbing season? Is this normal? How do you climb or train through this?
Ben Moon Insta Post : 2019 MB Grades Are Sandbagged [Post link](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIqcAKJDVtf/), text below for those without insta.

&gt; The weather has really crapped out in the UK now so it’s back inside for lots of board sessions. I’m pretty excited. I’ve been mixing my sessions up between the old school room 50° board, the moon board with the 2019 set up and splat board we have at the new School Room. Switching between the 50° School Room board and the 2019 MoonBoard has made me realise how sandbag the grades are on this new 2019 set up. Its definitely the best set up yet but the grades are really tough. The old 50° board used to be considered tough but I think the grades on the 2019 board are probably two grades harder!! I’m trying to figure out what to do about it. This is a new problem I set yesterday called It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue which is a 1966 Them track written by Bob Dylan and sung by Van Morrison. This is what they were listening to the year I was born. Check the song and the problem out! Benchmark 7c.
Finally stopped being so stubborn about it, my footwork is awful. I took an hour to watch some videos of my climbing and man is my footwork bad. I constantly readjust my feet on the wall and tend to bounce my foot on footholds I don't trust. I have general ideas for foot work drills (i.e silent feet, one-touch, etc) but are there other drills that might help too?
A local guy just sent a V10 with insane slopers. I asked him how to train for it, and he gave delightfully specific advice. Thought you might find this useful.
Isometric exercise guidelines from Science and Practice of Strength Training I've been reading Science and Practice of Strength Training just to get a better base of understanding of the fundamentals of strength training.

I've noticed a curious suggestion for isometric exercise:

*The following guidelines govern isometric training protocol:*

* *Intensity—maximal effort*
* *Effort duration—5 to 6 s*
* *Rest intervals—approximately 1 min if only small muscle groups, such as calf muscles, are activated; up to 3 min for large, proximally located muscles*
* *Number of repetitions—usually 3 to 5 for each body position*
* *Training frequency—4 to 6 times per week with the objective to increase \[maximum force production\]; 2 times per week for maintenance of the strength gain*
* *Body position—(1) in the weakest point of the strength curve, or (2) throughout the complete range of motion with intervals of 20° to 30°, or (3) in an accentuated range of angular motion*

The intensity, effort duration, rest, and number of reps is similar to the general recommendation for max hangboard protocols.

However, it's interesting how the suggestion for *Training frequency* is *4 to 6 times per week* for increasing strength and *2 times per week* to maintain strength levels. Generally the suggestion I've seen before with hangboarding is 2-3 times a week at most.

Also interesting in the *Body position* how it recommends *an accentuated range of angular motion* as the most efficient position but maybe I'm misunderstanding what that actually means.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess for climbers focusing on hangboarding these guidelines could be a little overdoing it as the tendons in the fingers and hangs are quite fragile, but curious what peoples thoughts are.
Today I suck less hard than previously I finally completed six 7-3 repeaters in a row with no failed hangs. I've been using the grip Grips And Grades app twice a week for six weeks.

I have a question for you harder climbers: what now? Should I repeat the feat a few times to prove it wasn't fluke or do something else?

(INFO: climbing outside is a no go and my country is locked down until mid January. Gyms haven't been open since November :'(  )
How to get better at visualizing? When considering beta for a boulder/route, I often come up with moves that seem possible from the ground but are totally impossible when you actually try them. This happens most often in weird gym setting sequences.  My question is, what strategies do people use to get better at visualizing what you actually can and can't do on the wall? Obviously this mostly comes with experience, but I wonder if people consciously try to train it.
The concept of 'the box' as it relates to climbing For reference, I am not a new climber, around 3 years, mainly bouldering experience v6 inside V4 outside. I have heard the term of a box and staying within it thrown around many times now. What is the box exactly? Is it the imaginary space between your hands and feet? How do you use it to your advantage? Any and all advice would be appreciated!
Climbing goals for 2021(non number related) This year will end soon and while the necessity of having new years resolutions and goals can be discussed, I personally  like them. 

Still, I feel, as if a lot of people in this sub, me included,  are often overly  fixated on numbers when refering to climbing goals.

This can be seen in a fixation on the max grade, a fixation on hangboard numbers etc.

While setting goals this way can be helpful, I also want to set myself some non number related goals this year.

 I think having goals that require one to go by feel and to be honest at the end of next year, can be a great source of progress as well.

(In comparison I might reach a goal like climb X grade this year but there will still be doubts like "it was probably a soft climb" etc. Or "my Form could have been better at Z exercise")



Some examples I have thought off for myself so far:

- Stay injury free for the whole year and try to also minimise little tweaks

- Try more boulders and routes which I find to be my complete anti-style and which push my limites this way

-Repeat more climbs, which I have found to be really nice no matter what grade they are

- Get my mental game up a few notches

- Have as much fun in climbing as possible without relying on the dopamin boosts of sends

-Overall the theme of the goals I am thinking of is trying to be a more healthy, sustainable climber who will still be able to have fun climbing 25 years from now (but if you have other themes in mind, I would like to read them aswell)

What are some not number related goals you guys set yourself? Do you sometimes think you have too much of a fixation on numbers even though climbing is a lot dependent on feeling and experience?

Feel free to tell me about your "normal" climbing goals for 2021 as well if you like.
Anyone 50+ hangboarding? I've been inspired to train for bouldering lately. Haven't used my hangboard in a while, and I'm thinking of incorporating a weekly session of repeaters with increased load on tree edges (something like 9 series total, not sure if it's worth more than that). The most important thing for me is to prevent injuries, and of course I want more finger strength. I'm 51. Any fellow gen xers training? Any advice appreciated. Also, what are the preferred hangboards these days based on the latest science?
Where To Begin Dedicated Training/Hiring a Coach Hey all, just looking for some general advice on how to work in some dedicated training to my regular routine. I usually climb 3 days a week (1 limit day) and fingerboard on my BM1k one or two days a week. I go outside whenever I can but with a rainy winter in Squamish and the gym only allowing 3 days a week I am working with what I've got.

I've sent multiple V8, many V7 and under and just sent my first V9 (in 8 tries!). I have identified some of my weaknesses as keeping tension in my lower body on steep overhang (I am 6'3" so physiology is a big part there) and I'd like to increase my confidence on small (&lt;8mm) edges. I excel at steep, burly climbing with big moves on good holds, as well as compression/slopers.

Just looking for advice on how I can change up my routine to work some of these problem areas and bump into the double digits!

Cheers
Running Stairs for bouldering? I live in an apartment building with about 20 flights of stairs. I'm wondering if anyone has done stair training and if so what did your workout look like and did it impacted your climbing in a positive or negative way? I figure either way it will make approaches and hauling pads easier.
Low friction hold training If you want to do movement drills, the main method to improve is to increase difficulty by making the holds worse or more far apart. I think the main reason this works is because this way we are decreasing the room for error. This forces you to learn better technique than you could get away with larger, closer together holds, the alternative is failure. The downside is the increased load on the fingers, which for many people can be a bottleneck at some point in their climbing training.

Another way to decrease the room for error would be to use very low friction holds/feet, you can use bigger holds and still have less room for error than using smaller holds. I'd expect such setup to give more training value for the same amount of finger work you have to do. The only unknown is if this setup would decrease room for error in the same direction as using small holds, and thus make you learn the same technique or not.

Note: I am viewing this from a beginners perspective. My bottleneck for climbing more is definitely finger recovery.

What are your toughts about this idea? Bad? Interesting?

Has anyone tried something like this?
What I’ve learned after 2 months of golfer’s elbow. When I first got golfer’s elbow two months ago, I was surprised that a lot of the resources that come up when you google it are contradictory, out-of-date, or just really, really long-winded. The Climb Harder Wiki has a [good list of the best resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/wiki/index#wiki_injuries_-_elbows). After combing through material, and talking to doctors, physiotherapists, and experienced climbers, I’d just like to assemble some of the main take-aways. This is an active area of research and knowledge seems to be changing quickly. If I get anything wrong, or miss anything, let me know and I’ll edit the list to make this as accurate and helpful as possible.

I am not a medical expert. Whenever there is a contradiction between anything I write and actual experts, trust them. If you have an injury, you should book an appointment with a doctor or physio.

**Rest = Bad**

If you stop climbing for many weeks or months, it will make the pain from golfer’s elbow disappear, but the pain will just come back when you start climbing again — even if you wait months. Tendons need to be stimulated through exertion to heal. The challenge, therefore, is to do exercises that stimulate them in just the right amount without making the problem worse.

You should still rest as per normal, and it's good to take it easy climbing, as I note below.

**Stretching doesn’t help**

The only time that stretching may help is if the forearm muscle is so tight that it is not letting the tendon go loose enough to heal. So, [this stretch from Tom Randall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XphfEu8y9oY&amp;ab_channel=LatticeTraining) might be helpful if you have a tight forearm. [Otherwise](http://drjuliansaunders.com/dodgy-elbows/), it’s [probably irrelevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUIfegWq31E&amp;t=664s).

**The usual stuff: sleep lots, eat well, exercise.**

Dave MacLeod is right: full nights of sleep are [super important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iMueqiCsVI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=DaveMacLeod) for healing. Don’t take this lightly. I’m sure food matters too. Cardio is probably helpful. In general, be healthy.

**Consistent Rehab Exercises**

* There are certain exercises you should do consistently to stimulate healing. Most fall into two categories: isometric and eccentric. Isometric means you’re holding a weight without moving. Eccentric means, roughly, you’re slowly letting the weight down. The following three seem to be gold standard.
   * Hammer “Supination and Pronation.” Get a hammer, hold the handle, and [twist it](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://drjuliansaunders.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dodgy_elbows_03.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://drjuliansaunders.com/dodgy-elbows/&amp;tbnid=E0fiG93eXyZypM&amp;vet=1&amp;docid=0a6xioD0xPQlJM&amp;w=291&amp;h=135&amp;q=eccentric+hammer+turn+for+climbers+elbow&amp;hl=en-us&amp;source=sh/x/im) from left to right [like this](https://youtu.be/JqkJGiYDAEA). Hold for five seconds when the hammer is parallel to the ground. That way, it’s both isometric and eccentric. My physio said to do this 15 times in 3 sets. Steven Low recommends some different reps/frequencies depending on whether you go with [“heavy slow resistance” or max reps](http://stevenlow.org/overcoming-tendonitis/).
   * Wrist curls with [a band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLVJbQeUmsA&amp;ab_channel=MichaelBraccio) or [a weight](https://youtu.be/kIYDcsOpnyE?t=344). You can include an isometric component by holding the weight static for a few seconds between reps.
   * “[Reverse tyler twists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtR8fYEUnXI).” This “[rope forearm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wVvR8y5cdM&amp;ab_channel=NicholasMatthes)” exercise is similar.
* Here are some more tentative ideas that seem to have worked for some people:
   * One of the risk factors for golfer's elbow is a lack of antagonist muscles, meaning muscles that do the opposite of what you use while climbing. If you lack those muscles, it may be making your golfer's elbow worse. Some people therefore find it helps to do lots of push ups, bench presses, or tricep workouts — and this is usually a good idea anyways.
   * Someone in the comments found hangboarding on wide pinches helps. It does seem to get at the right spots.
   * I also do controlled 90 degree lock offs on jugs, based on an experienced climber’s advice, and another climber in the comments suggests this has helped for him too. Be extra cautious on this idea and don't do it if it feels too strenuous.
* **Frequency.** My physiotherapist said to do these exercises everyday but now I see Steven Low says to do these [3-4 times a week](http://stevenlow.org/overcoming-tendonitis/). Daily worked for me but Low probably knows more about this specifically than my physiotherapist does. Thanks if you can disambiguate.
* **Don’t go to fail.** That can cause the problem to get worse.
* Let me know if there are other good rehab exercises to put here.

**Progressive Reloading**

* An expert in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUIfegWq31E&amp;t=664s) says the key to recovery, after much research, appears to be “progressive reloading,” and then fails to explain what that means — in a half-hour video! Arg! [The idea](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2020/11/19/bjsports-2020-103403) seems [to be this](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Tendinopathy_Rehabilitation): do rehab exercises and any climbing at an easier level, and slowly increase difficulty overtime.
* Most people seem to agree that you should continue climbing and doing hangboard sessions. (But ask a doctor or a physio if you got it bad). However, You want to dial back to moderate intensity. Try to avoid anything that is a massive struggle, particularly if there are moves that really put pressure on an injured area. A commenter below says, "You want higher volume of moderate intensity. 5/10 pain max." A good rule of thumb is to climb a few grades below your max. It seems to help to spend twice as long warming up, very slowly. However, if the pain goes away once you warm up, that's not permission to climb hard.
* My physio recommended doing shorter sessions. If the problem gets worse after a certain time period, note how long it took to get to that point, and stop before then in future sessions. One experienced climber recommended doing one fewer session per week than you did previously, though I wasn’t able to confirm whether this recommendation is evidence based. Call it tentative.

**Avoid aggravating exercises.**

[Steven Low](http://stevenlow.org/overcoming-tendonitis/) says that it’s fine to do “painful exercises” because some help recovery, whereas you should avoid “aggravating exercises” that make it worse. [MacLeod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iMueqiCsVI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=DaveMacLeod) says something similar. Frustratingly, they don't say what these aggravating exercises are. I’m listing some highly-tentative candidates for aggravating exercises and would welcome feedback on evidence or people’s experiences for what kinds of things to avoid.

* Knee-ups and plank progressions seemed to make my golfer’s elbow flare up like crazy, so consider avoiding these until you’re better.
* Sudden deloading seems to be a problem. You may notice that when you slip off a hold, it hurts the tendons sometimes. Recently, when I’ve done hangboarding with weight, if I let go suddenly, my golfer’s elbow flares a bit. It doesn't seem to be a problem, however, if I slowly ease myself off the hold, giving the tendon time to relax.
* Slopers seem to cause more trouble than crimps and pinches.
* While a controlled lock-off on easy jugs on a hangboard appears to be fine, and is perhaps helpful, strenuous lock-offs while climbing have caused me and [other climbers](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/8w9vbh/elbow_pain_after_hard_lockoffs/) trouble.
* Some [online sources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iMueqiCsVI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=DaveMacLeod) say chin ups are fine, even though they make golfer’s elbow hurt. I am skeptical, since anecdotally, chin ups may cause [some people](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jlxgbq/mark_rippetoes_chinup_protocol_for_fixing_golfers/) to have golfer’s elbow. It seems you may as well avoid them until conclusive evidence comes in.

Again, all of this is tentative. I would be curious to hear if others have had the same experience.

**Test your elbow by pressing your nose**

* Also tentative. I found you can test how your elbow is doing by pressing your index and middle finger against your nose. It seems to be just the right position to provoke the current level of pain. This is useful for comparing one day to the next.

**Expect daily variation, pain, and frustration**

* It is normal for it to feel like you’re making progress on one day, whereas the next it feels worse. Expect it to go up and down.
* Expect it to take a long time to heal. My physio said to expect 8-12 weeks minimum, which seems about right. Trust the program and stick with it. You’ll be able to climb again soon, honest.
* Once it feels better, avoid climbing to your max, and doing the “aggravating exercises” that make it worse, for a few weeks yet. I’ve backtracked a number of times at the finish line because I wasn’t patient enough.

**Train other stuff in the meantime.**

* If find it helps psychologically to still be making progress on something, so consider taking this time to become more flexible, strengthen your hip flexors, do pistol squats, and build your core. You might just come back a stronger climber.

**Good God, avoid getting golfer’s elbow**

* Doing the rehab exercises listed above as “prehab” helps protect against golfer’s elbow.
* You can do other antagonist exercises to help protect yourself, such as lots of push ups and tricep curls. Also, you can do [rope forearm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wVvR8y5cdM&amp;ab_channel=NicholasMatthes) exercises.
* There’s [a maxim](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/47/9/536) that “tendons don't like rest or change.’” If you rest for many days or weeks, ease yourself back into climbing slowly. If you change your routine in a major way (such as by climbing 2 days in a row when you’re not used to it), don’t overdo it on the days that you’re first making the change.

So that’s my brain dump. Please do tell me if I got anything wrong. I just want to amplify the best science and experience.

Edit 1: updated section on moderate-intensity climbing. Edit 2: added some more rehab exercises based on comments. Also, the note on working other stuff at the end.
Micro campusboard Just made this detachable 6-rung campusboard (two different rung depths). You can't do bumps because you will swing too much and bump your feet and knees into the wall and board. But it works perfectly for alternating rungs (1-3-5, 1-4-6.5 etc).

Angle is 6 degrees and the surface is 14 cm away from the wall at the bottom. You toes will still slightly touch the wall, but that's fine. My wall is really bad and a larger protrusion would give too much force on the screws.

5/3/1 General Strength Training + Climbing I know this is not quite the purpose of this sub, but I've been trying for a number of years to effectively juggle general strength training and climbing. It's tough to program adequate volume while structuring the split for recovery.

In case it's helpful for anyone else, I think I've finally found what works best for me and just wanted to share.

It's based around Wendler's 5/3/1, which has a bunch of googleable info so I won't write it here. But basically its a very simple wave pattern linear progression focused on Overhead press, squat, bench, and deadlift. For climbing I've also added weighted chins as a core movement. I think it's a great program as a climbing supplement because by design the volume and progression is managed very conservatively.

Been running this for awhile and it's working really well because every pull (and pulley) intensive day is followed by a total rest day. The only consecutive day (Saturday + Sunday) hits antagonist groups. The only doubled up day (Deadlift and OHP) pairs the most and least taxing movements.

(5/3/1) indicates a core movement following the 5/3/1 progression.

Stretching fingers for injury prevention Should I stretch my fingers to prevent injury? How should I do it? Is there any risk involved with this?

It seems like a simple question, yet I never see much on it. I noticed if I've been pulling hard with a finger so it aches a little, and I gently pull it outward, it feels instantly stronger and less painful/tight. I get a similar effect from hanging on a large (25ish mm) edge. Is this good? Or should a stretch look more like just pulling the fingers back?

If anyone knows the actual mechanics involved here I would be especially interested to hear what you think.
Open hand/3 finger drag is really weak on hangboard I'm hangboarding during lockdown in my city. I never trained open hand until I got a pulley injury a couple months ago (all good now). I always half crimped everything, not even full crimp (I think I've full crimped like 3 times in my life). My half crimp is great. I can do 150% bodyweight on 18mm for 10 seconds. I can do 7 seconds of bodyweight on 7mm. I can do a one arm hang on 18mm for 8 seconds. My half crimp is strong. 

My open hand.. ouch. I'm training on a 19 mm edge. My pinkies are too short to actually grip when I'm doing open hand so it's technically 3 finger drag I guess. 10 seconds on 19 mm is hard. Sometimes it hurts a bit in my left hand (not the one that has been injured). Honestly it's pathetic. I'm really curious if I'm actually just doing something wrong because of how bad it is. I feel it should be a bit stronger than that. 

So two questions: what exactly should my thumb and pinky be doing during this hold on the hangboard? (wondering if I'm positioning them right when hanging, maybe they're causing the little bit of pain I get sometimes). And if I suck this bad at this grip what should my training intensity be for it right now? Should I just do like 10 seconds on with a minute break in between each set for like 10 sets or something?
How do you regain the stoke? I was climbing a lot before and through most of this pandemic but this past semester really burned me out and I now have no motivation to climb even though I finally have time for it. How do I get back in the zone so I can keep improving?
Eric Hörst threshold intervals for training Aerobic Power In Eric Horst's 26th podcast at 53:10, he recommends intervals of climbing for 3 minutes with a light pump and resting 3 minutes as opposed to ARCing for developing Aerobic Power (the rate at which the Aerobic energy system generates ATP). His logic being that ARCing is mostly just training Aerobic Capacity rather than Aerobic Power while threshold intervals have a higher focus on Aerobic Power. Has anyone tried training with threshold intervals and if so have they found that they are recovering more easily on routes and between attempts than they used to before training threshold intervals. 

Thanks for any helpful insights.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Have people found benefits to training threshold intervals rather than ARCing for recovery on routes
Is it worth it to drop my bf% over a sustained period? I’m a 6ft 1, 152 lbs, 19 year old male, and I currently have a bf% of around 14% (if my weird little scale is accurate which it probably isn’t, but based on a visual comparison with 14% body fat this seems fairly close). I mostly care about bouldering, but I also want to progress in lead as well. I also want to start getting into comps (both bouldering and lead, but again I mostly care about bouldering). I’m not really looking to lose a bit of weight in the short term. Rather, I’m wondering if it will be beneficial to my climbing long term if I drop my bf% to around 10-12% (healthily, of course) and maintain that composition. Thoughts?
Should I train?! Last year I decided I wanted to push grades and ticked my first 12a (F7a+).  This year I sent another 8 of the same grade.  Gyms being closed much of the year meant I mostly just climbed outside, though I did hangboard a little (I can hang 140% on 20mm for 10 sec), and just returned to indoor climbing this month (sending V5-V6 in a session usually).

My intent is to continue "just climbing, not training" as long as I feel I'm progressing.  I'm close to a couple 12b's and hope to tick 12c this year.  I'm 58, so I don't have a lot of time to continue improving probably... so I thought maybe I should train!?  Do you think I'd benefit from training?  If yes, what kind is appropriate given my age and level?!
Mobility/flexibility of climbers and gathering info. I'm curious about the overall mobility and flexibility of better climbers. At what point does mobility training start to improve/hinder performance? Are there general goals to hit (touching toes, being able to do a high pistol squat, shoulder mobility, splits , etc.). There are plenty of studies doing strength and endurance but it seems harder to find good or any results on mobility/flexibility goals. Would anyone be interested in a survey with climbing grade and mobility tests?

Train all the time, or only at your max? Question in regards to pro climbers training plans. I've noticed a stark difference in how different pro climbers train. Some say during training seasons they climb/train multiple times a day almost everyday. However, others value recovery a lot more and seem to train a reasonably small amount for a pro athlete (maybe 12-15 hours). I'm gonna list a few examples just so you guys know what I'm getting at.

First group: **Full time climbing beasts**

Adam Ondra: In an epicTV special a wile back where adam describes his training regime, he says he trains [6-7 days a week](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADSkNXjOg5Y&amp;t=1m10s) and has 3 sessions on each day (power, bouldering, endurance). 

Drew Ruana: Don't have link to exact spot because its a [long interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1cf_C0z4wM) and I can't find it anymore but Drew said he used to train 40 hours a week (I think he said 8 hours a day, 5 days a week). That's a full time job's worth of training right there. He doesn't do that anymore, but that's because he is riding the wave of his past efforts in an outdoor climbing streak.

Second group: **Part time climbing beasts**

Sean Mccoll [talked about how he trains](https://www.trainingbeta.com/media/sean-mccoll/) a little bit in this interview and said he trains 10-15 hours a week. Supposedly 16 hours a week is too tiring for him. For those of you who don't know him, Sean is a successful competition climber foremost. 

Jan Hojer: Jan Hojer is a unique climber in the fact the he is taller and heavier than most climbers (but also one of the most powerful climbers of all time). He says in an [interview on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_rzpQGrq8&amp;t=0m15s) that he trains 3-5 times a week, 2 hours a day. Doesn't quite add up, but then he says 10-14 hours a week (maybe that includes stretching or other non-climbing related stuff etc). He says he "doesn't think" that is less than most other boulderers, but of course there are some exceptions like I've listed above. 


There are obviously many more examples, but I think these 2 of each group are pretty good indicators of different training philosophies. You have the climbers who train multiple times a day nearly every day, treating it like a full time job. These climbers are likely tired a lot, and are probably very rarely actually working at their max due to fatigue (however, a reduction before comp/climbing season would bring them too their max). On the other spectrum, you have climbers that take a rest day between nearly every session of 2-hour climbing, meaning they can perform at their max more often during training. 

Which one is better? Can anyone slowly work up their work capacity to training more than 20 hours a week, maybe even 25-30? This subreddit has always seemed heavily biased towards the 2nd group, but why is that? A lot of people I have messaged who have grown up on climbing teams and such can relate a lot to the first group as well. I think it makes sense for regular people not to train that much in a week due to time, but even some pro climbers do it, despite having much more time to climb in general. What are your guy's thoughts on this topic.
Interview | Climbing Researcher Guillaume Levernier on coaching Mélissa Le Nevé to her historic ascent of Action Directe
V-double digit/7C+ climbers, how often are you hangboarding these days? Curious to hear from those who have more experience chime in and talk about how often you're hanging/training given that it's COVID and winter.

Do current conditions matter? Is your psyche affected given COVID or weather? Are you climbing more because it's colder? Maybe less? Or are you spending more time inside? Has your regimen even changed at all? Or are you prepping for a trip? 

Share your thoughts!

Edit: I'm so glad people are sharing their anecdotal bits and pieces! This wasn't meant to be a post about sharing hard and fast rules, but just seeing what others climbing at a higher level are doing with their time these days. Are you hanging? Lifting? Sleeping? Getting outside? Dying for the 302nd time in Bloodborne? That's all!
Thoughts on the Climber Fit training program with Alex Puccio? I've been getting loads of advertisements for the Climber Fit program which advertises 2 climbing training routines for V6+ and sub-V6 climbers.

I fall into the sub-V6 category myself but I've been following my own routine for a couple of years now. I dont even have access to a gym right now so Im not even considering buying the program.

I was just wondering if the community has an opinion on this program given the big name attached to it. Has anyone given it a shot?
How to get back into climbing I was a decent indoor climber (sent a few soft v8s) pre pandemic and climbed for about 5 years and I’m 26.
Due to the pandemic and who I’m living with I haven’t been able to climb since last March. 
I should be getting the vaccine around February and I talked to those in my household and I’m going to be able to climb again after the second dose. (they feel safe about me going back to the gym after being vaccinated) 
How should I approach getting back into climbing and what should I do beforehand to possibly prep for getting back into the gym?
I have been running and doing peloton workouts. I have a tension block with a 25 lb. weight. 
I am hoping to maximize my time and effort to get back to where I once was and be able to go outside in the summer. 
Thank you all in advance!
While I'm a bit limited by the height of my wall, I tried to set a simulation for a project I want to try next year (zombie nation 8A). Does anyone have experience with simulation boulders who could give me some pointers?
2020 end of year Goals Review! End of the year means it’s time to review our past goals, and start planning out goals for next year. Feel free to comment what your goals were this year, which of them you’ve accomplished, and how you changed/adapted them if needed. 

Previous goals update post from the mid year: https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/i5jpjq/how_are_your_2020_goals_going_volume_2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
I think it's time for the obligatory "Goals for 2021" post :D I welcome everyone to write down the goals for the upcoming year down here in the comments, you can even use the 'RemindMe' thingy to remind yourself of the goals in a few months and then check out how many of them if at all did you accomplish :)

Hope you all will achieve your most important goals and have a great year in training and climbing hard !
Exercises for shoulder strength I have been climbing for a year and a half now and I climb around 12c/v7 and I was told I should work on my shoulders. Do you guys have any suggestions
Sporadic hangboard sessions? I'm an intermediate boulderer/climber who climbs outside about once a week and then on a moonboard or homewall about twice a week. There are sometimes days or quick family vacations where I would like to fit in a session or two for maintenance and all I have access to is a hangboard. I don't hangboard regularlly. So, **are sporadic hangboard sessions beneficial in a case like this?** 

I'm envisioning some sort of repeater protocol for these sessions, but welcome other opinions.
Toe Pain and Climbing So this may seem like a silly post...but my right big toe has been quite sore for the past month or so. I’ve worn aggressive climbing shoes for about 4 years now, so I doubt that it’s from the shoes alone. I most likely jammed it/banged it against the wall at some point without noticing acute effects, but then had the damage lingering. It’s making it quite painful to try to climb in aggressive shoes, which seem to make the pain flare up after a session. 
Just wondering if anyone else has had experience with this. My only thought is to try and wear a loose/non aggressive shoe on my right foot in hopes that the toe will heal better without being smooshed into aggressive shoes. 
It’s at a point where it seems to limit my abilities to weight that foot, so I figured I’d ask for some help/advice.
What are good types of climbing goals for improving in 2021? Having some goal climbs this year, and/or a goal grade is great and probably most of us have these types of goals in mind for 2021 already.

What are some less obvious goals to try for in 2021?

A few ideas:

- a climbing pyramid. Well known concept but easy to forget to do.

- consistency goals, ie, "climb x routes a week every week"

- volume goals, ie, "climb x pitches this year"

- fitness goals, ie, "increase max pull-ups to x"

- cross training goals, esp. bouldering vs sport, sport vs trad

What type of goals have motivated and worked for you? Do you have any goals for 2021 that you think others might find interesting/useful?
Best way for a beginner (~V2) to train whilst gyms and climbing gyms are closed I’ve been bouldering pretty regularly since the first UK lockdown ended in September but now that gyms are closed again in tier 4 I’m concerned about regressing.

What are the best ways for me to keep training at home with limited equipment?
Focusing too much on strength benchmarks and coming to terms about being a terrible climber! I’ll preface this with saying I have been climbing 4 years and sustained my fair share of finger injuries as well as one shoulder injury ! Also I apologize if this is a rant, writing helps me process and everyone on this sub seems supportive enough I feel comfortable writing this here! 

Now I am by no means a strong climber, I can hang 160% on an 18mm edge if it’s a good day 150% if it’s not a great day so I am not weak either. I made a goal last year to climb v7 outside this year and I climbed 4, all single session! I also managed one v8 !! Which I was stoked by as I even flashed it, but on sendage.com someone had suggested a downgrade to v7, which is fine! I am still stoked on it! My point is, I am a decently strong person and I’ve put in a lot of days training when parks closed down for three months last spring and climbing outside after which is  I’ve realized I am a terrible climber. Maybe one of the worst haha If the Boulder I am trying is a sit start or has some kind of trickery, no matter the grade.. it’s going to take me a while to figure out the moves and get my body to properly execute them! For example there’s a v7 I tried that shared a start with a v3.. v3 went straight up into a tall slab from a sit in a shallow cave, the v7 went out right traversing an overhang until you pull over the lip onto a v0 ish slab. I couldn’t do the start but tried it a move in and climbed it to the top. I tried the start for about an hour after that and couldn’t manage to pull off the ground from the underclings! 

Recap.. I am a shit climber and love bouldering outside as much as I can but I focus too much on chasing finger strength benchmarks rather I need to work on my technique !
What hangboard data would you like to log? [feedback request for Quopi] A couple of weeks ago [I asked for feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/k6uwb1/i_built_an_app_to_track_climbing_and_bouldering/) on an app I’m developing: [Quopi](https://quopi.com). Since then I received messages from a couple of enthusiastic users. Really cool to see that other climbers find it useful and are willing to provide suggestions!

Many questions and requests were about expanding and improving the hangboard workouts. It’s already possible to log reps, sets, resting time etc., but logging things such as hold size or grip type isn’t possible yet. Based on your responses I came up with the following improvements.

For a hangboard session I want to add four extra data points:

* Hold type: edge, jug, sloper or pinch
* Hold size: ranging from 5 to 150 mm
* Hand position: Four fingers, Middle Ring Pink, Index Middle Ring, Middle Ring, Index Middle, or Middle
* Grip position: Full Crimp, Half Crimp, Open Crimp, or Open Hand

When selecting an edge hold, all three other data points are required.

When selecting a pinch hold, only the hold size is required. Hand position and grip position are irrelevant, as a pinch will always have a “pinch” grip.

When selecting a jug or sloper, the hold size, hand position and grip position are irrelevant and not required. You will always use your entire hand on a jug and sloper, using as much friction as possible.

Check out this little demo video to get an impression on what it could look like when you create a custom hangboard workout.

[Demo of Quopi that shows how to create a hangboard exercise that can be used in a workout](https://reddit.com/link/kpir9d/video/wflkexlvj3961/player)

So, the questions I have are as follows:

* Does this make sense to you, using hold type, hold size, hand position and grip position?
* Does it feel intuitive to configure your hangboard workouts this way? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?
* Are there any other data points you are currently logging, or would like to log for a hangboard session?
* For all you Americans: are you accustomed to using millimeters for edge depth? Or does it make more sense to use inches?

Feedback, suggestions or other remarks are more than welcome. Thanks for your responses!

**UPDATE 20/01**: The new feature is live! 🎉 You can now add hangboard exercises and specify hold and grip details. These exercises also work with the workout feature in Quopi, so you can create your own custom hangboard workouts.

Was doing this plan for 3months and made huge progress (was able to send hardest grade on my gym finally).

Rest days are active: stretching (mostly PNF) for 1h and some bike (2-3h, 60-70km).

Goals:

\- lose weight to 75kg;

\- climb couple of 7c at the end of year;

\- be able to send hardest grade in my gym in less sesh (1st boulder took me like 5sesh);

\- campus 1-4-7;

&amp;#x200B;

I have couple question to ya all. Gonna point them out for clear view:

1. When should I start working on one arm hangs?
2. Is the structure of every day and weeks fine?
3. From your experience, based on my result what is my weakness? I feel like fingers and weight :P
4. Any other insights are welcomed!

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers and Happy New Year :)
What are the advantages and disadvantages of max hangs vs longer hangs (40 seconds) vs longer workouts with less rest in between (7 second on 3 seconds off) for finger strength?
Good exercises to improve technique? (Especially footwork/engaging legs) I've recently been working on breaking a plateau of V5-V6 in the gym. I've come to the conclusion that my strength (at least for the immediate future/next few grades) is not my limiting factor. I've realized that its my lack of technique that often forces my body to overcompensate via raw strength (cutting feet too often, not engaging my core as I should). Initially I thought that by implementing the tension board into my training that I could progress, but Ive found that while the TB is a great tool for developing power, Im not so convinced that it does much for my footwork/overall technique. So my question is this: what are some effective exercises that I can stat including in my training to help develop better footwork and core engagement? I currently try to implement the "silent feet" and "one touch" exercises into my warmups, but thats all. I climb 2 days a week for about 2 hours each session, typically I will warm up on the wall for \~20 minutes, then work some harder problems around V5-6, and finish off with tension board (some days I devote totally to projecting certain climbs \~V6-7 on the TB). For clarification, Im a solid V5 climber, I flash most 5's that are put up in my gym, and can climb 95% of all 5's in a new set within 1-3 tries. But when I start moving to V6 its a totally different story, I can only climb 2-3 V6's in a new set, even after trying all of them over a dozen times.
how to stay psyched and training during depression? I'm in the UK and we've just entered lockdown again - gyms shut, outdoor climbing off the cards. I'm lucky enough to have a home wall and hangboard and I run and have a bike also.

But I've been feeling very very low with depression lately. When I train or run I feel numb, I don't enjoy it as much as I did before, and I don't feel as motivated due to not looking like climbing going to be possible for several months here.

I'm very much forcing myself to train and exercise even though I only want to lie in bed all day instead. It doesn't make me feel any better but I know it's important to keep up so when climbing is back on I have kept my strength. I'm trying to do it early in the mornign so it's out the way and I can go back to bed for the rest of the day afterwards.

I want to train, but I also really don't want to train.. or do anything!

Already on antidepressants, and got support.

But this depression isn't going away any time soon - any tips for organising training to make it easier and more manageable to sustain during depression?
Mélissa Le Nevé's coach -- Guillaume Levernier -- agrees to answer Reddit forum questions Hi everyone, based on your feedback to my original interview, I reached out to Guillaume and he has agreed to take questions.  He doesn't feel comfortable conversing in English in real time, so rather than do an AMA, he asked if I could send him your questions.  Have at it all.  Post them.  Below is the original article:

[https://beta-angel.com/2020/12/27/interview-climbing-researcher-guillaume-levernier-on-coaching-melissa-le-neve-to-her-historic-ascent-of-action-directe/](https://beta-angel.com/2020/12/27/interview-climbing-researcher-guillaume-levernier-on-coaching-melissa-le-neve-to-her-historic-ascent-of-action-directe/)
Wooden holds on outdoor board Hey, I built a mini-moonboard back in November and the B/C wood hold sets are due to (finally) arrive in the coming weeks. Just wondering what peoples experiences are with wooden holds outside? I've heard mixed opinions - some saying it's not at all worth it (bit late for me..), others that it's totally fine provided the board has some protection from the elements. I live in London, so fairly wet &amp; humid climate. Got a tarp nailed to the back that sheds rain well and covers most of the front and sides when the wall's not in use. Any tips/advice?
Things we say (or ask) and what I think they mean Climbers say a lot of things about how to get better/stronger/climb harder, but not all of them are clear. My goal with this post isn't to give specific exercises, reps/sets, or give a nuanced training plan. I'm hoping to give information that helps you make an informed decision about what needs to happen. I'm also not trying to hold my opinions as gospel. If you have something to add, please do. If you disagree with something, help me understand.

TL;DR: Climb more, try hard, do an exercise if it helps you send.

# Just Climb

As with any skill a human can endeavor to improve at, you have to do that Thing in order to get better at it. Yes, there are useful off the wall workouts that can help, but they likely don't help as much as climbing. I've recently realized this with myself - I've been very concerned with how much weight I could add to my hangboard, but that's just a tool to help with finger strength (which, yes, more finger strength always helps).

However, handboarding is not climbing. How often am I hanging on two shoulder-width holds, 20mm in depth, perfectly even, with no feet on? Never, I don't think it's happened even once, indoors or out. What actually happens when I climb is using holds of various sizes in various positions with differing force vectors that I need to move my entire body through.

The hangboard is a useful tool, but don't let it distract from your goal of climbing harder (unless the primary goal is, in fact, to hangboard with more weight). It's so tempting because it's much easier to quantify the effort than it is with a boulder, as grades are nebulous and mean different things to different people with different strengths, weaknesses, and body types.

**Takeaway**: Climb. Climb new boulders/routes, things that are your 'anti-style', holds that make you anxious, angles that you feel uncomfortable with.

# Try hard

I think this is the unsung hero of any advice you can give someone about climbing harder. This is a mental component that's about trying moves that feel impossible, staying on holds that are garbage, and generally giving a movement the best effort, rather than letting yourself off the wall.

This might be a bit murky, but I think you can tell how hard someone is trying by two things: where their hands are when they fall, and how they fall.

Hands: imagine someone trying to do a big move, perhaps a dyno. They bounce up and down a couple times, preparing for the movement. They shoot up in an attempt to grab the next hold, but they don't actually move their hands from their original holds. They step down on to the mats.

Falling: I tend to think if you fall onto your feet in a standing position, you didn't try hard enough on that move. This isn't an absolute statement, as there are moves where maximum try hard will mean you fall straight down into a standing position. If you fall onto your back, or have to roll when you fall (perhaps missing the hold caused you to spin a bit), I think you were trying harder than if you landed on your feet.

Trying hard should mean gravity won, you were defeated, and that's why you aren't on the wall anymore. It doesn't mean that you thought hard about the next move, decided not to do it, and lowered yourself onto the mats. Generally, you should fall when you've attempted the move.

(Addendum at u/ParkaPoncho's suggestion) - It's easy to think that trying hard means gripping/pinching/bearing down on a hold as hard as you can, but that shouldn't be the only thing. Trying hard is a whole-body effort, not isolated to a specific body part or muscle group. Sometimes, the grip might not even be the thing you should focus on trying hard with. It could be pointing your toes more, bringing your hips closer to the wall, or turning your body to reach a bit farther. Or, as might often be the case when limit climbing, all of the above.

**Takeaway**: Fall because of gravity, not because you decided to. Trying hard should be taxing, both mentally and physically.

# Should I do [excercise]?

Note: I suppose this section is more about uninjured climbers. If you are injured, it seems perfectly fair to try to understand what exercises might be helpful for rehabilitation.

Maybe my view on this is a little harsh, but if you're asking the question "should I be doing \[thing\]", I don't think you know enough to understand why that thing will be helpful or not. What's easy is being told what to do, and doing it. What's hard is trying stuff, assessing whether or not it has helped, and adjusting from there.

Let's look at this concept through the lens of cooking. I used to hate it, and now I love it. Following a recipe just wasn't fun, and not something I could enjoy. I didn't really know why certain spices were used and why the measurements had to be so exact. Well, you learn which spices to learn the more you cook, and the amounts become less exact the more you cook. It's way more fun to have gone through the process of following recipes, and come out the other side able to take a meat or vegetable, apply seasoning as you see fit, and whipping up something from scratch. I feel like I'm creating something rather than following orders.

I'm not saying cooking will improve your climbing, but the same line of thinking applies. You have to try stuff and make adjustments where it makes sense. And if that seems confusing or unhelpful, I think you need to expose yourself to more climbing. When you encounter a difficult route/boulder, the crux (or wherever you're falling) should provide some insight as to what might be helpful.

**Takeaway**: Do an exercise if you can link it to how it would help on a real climb, or understand on a fundamental level why being stronger with this muscle/body part will help you climb hard.

# Should I hangboard or campus?

This one's a bit tricky. The answer is either maybe, or even probably, but unfortunately it depends. Both are great tools for their respective gains, but it depends largely on your climbing history. You could draw an arbitrary line, and say something like "if you climb v6 you should start hangboarding", but it isn't that straightforward.

I met a guy recently that's been climbing about a year, and saw him send a Kilter board v11 at 45 degrees in two goes, and he doesn't hangboard or campus. He's doesn't do anything but climb. Maybe he's a genetic freak, and is particularly well suited to making climbing gains faster than others. I wouldn't use that as an excuse to pardon yourself from doing the most sensible thing, which is to climb.

Campusing is very hard on the fingers, and you probably shouldn't do it until you have a respectable training age. Until you get more in-tune with your body, once a week is enough. If you're just starting out with it, it's probably very hard to do too much, as you simply won't be able to. If you are failing, call it quits and do another session in a week.

**Takeaway**: Spend more time climbing than hangboarding/campusing. When you do start either of these, it should be to help you climb harder, not get better at these activities themselves.

Thanks for reading.
Why do core exercises focus on abs instead of targeting both abs and (lower) back? With lockdown active and gyms closed, my training has gone from mostly climbing to home exercises. Upside (in a way) is that it finally got me to do some dedicated core work. That in turn got me thinking:

*Why do core exercises focus (mostly) on abs and  (mostly) neglect (lower) back muscles?*

My knowledge of the mechanics of the human body and it's application to climbing is limited. My idea is that abs are useful in climbing for stuff like controlling swing in an overhang, but intuitively I'd say that your lower back comes more into play when driving your hips towards the wall. And in general, your entire core is necessary for creating body tension.

Is it because your abs are usually relatively weak for the required work they have to do in climbing and your back muscles are relatively strong? Am I overestimating the work your back muscles have to do? Or should I be incorporating some form of exercise for my lower back such as deadlifting into my routine?

Would be great if someone more knowledgeable could enlighten me about this!

Finger rolls with Metolius Rock Rings or alike Hi,
any opinions on doing finger rolls with metolius rock rings or a similar device vs using a dumbbell.
I tried it an feel that I can perform the "finger up" movement with better form. 

I read that Tylor Nelson is using the tension flash board for similar exercises.
Climbing while pregnant Hi everyone!

I just wanted to start what I think could be an interesting conversation among female climbers (but guys are welcome to contribute and learn a few things too ;) )

What is your experience with climbing while pregnant? 

This subject is not very common among climbers, but since I'm in this situation, I would love some guidance. For those who have experience:

How long trough out your pregnancy did you climb?

How hard?

What was recovery like?

Did you do any special exercises?

Did you have some professional help? Or at least internet guidelines?

&amp;#x200B;

From my experience, medical advice is very ambiguous and it is basically: you can train while pregnant, like, take a walk. (this is so annoying). Of course, for someone who is very much used to train hard, this was terrible, and it took me some time to get over this advice and just do what I feel like. I feel okay, and I do climb in the gym, but I am curious about how long will this good period where I feel strong last, and what will I do in my last months of pregnancy. Or during recovery.

Feel free to comment :)
How does climbing skin actually work? A ton of top level climbers (with the noted exception of Alex “no conditions only weakness” Megos) talk about how important skin is for climbing, including ruana, siegrist, woods. Ruana even said in a podcast that bouldering at the highest levels is primarily a skin and conditions game.
Additionally, there are a million different products (climb on, rhino skin, all the half empty lotion bottles under my sink) that you can use. I’ve also heard of people sandpapering their fingers, but have no idea what the utility of that is, or what the biology behind any of this is.

Meanwhile, there doesn’t really seem to be any good guide for how one gets good skin, or even what good skin is. I have vague notions that you want resilient skin, that you want it to be malleable enough to form around the holds, and that you can achieve good skin for a specific rock type by climbing on that rock type. I certainly have had different results skin wise from different rock types; sandstone tends to always feel decent, but granite tears the shit out of my fingers.

Basically, I want “good” skin, but I have no idea what the forbidden magic to get that good skin is. Does anybody have advice for what they do for their skin, and what changes on different rock types, or resources that provide this type of information.
Ring routine for climbers I was wondering if there was some sort of approved ring routine for climbers. Being in lockdown for the second time now, I'm going back to rings and hangboard as my main training tools since they are probably the best thing you can easily do if you don't have a homewall. I'll hangboard one day and do a ring workout the other day.

Right now I'm using the Recommended Routine from the bodyweight reddit page (https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) because it covers pretty much everything one should probably be doing

But I'm currently trying to modify it slightly to make it more relevant to climbers (for example I'm changing some of the core work and I'm trying to add in I - Y - T)

Is there any specific things that a climber should really do that I didn't think of ? Any exercise or whatever that is a must add? Anything that should be removed?

For people who don't know the routine is basically :
3x5-8 Pull-up progression
3x5-8 Squat Progression
Rest
3x5-8 Dip progression
3x5-8 Hinge Progression (think deadlift and such)
Rest 
3x5-8 Row Progression
3x5-8 Push-up progression
Rest
Core stuff
I did the 9c Climber Test (from Magnus’ and Wideboy’s channel). Here are my scores and my experience: To start off with, I did this just for fun and don’t expect anyone to take this too seriously. However, it was very interesting/eye opening!

I am a 25 year old cis-man, 5’11ish (+1ish ape), and I weighed in this morning at 168 (in the clothes I took the test in). I work as a climbing coach and have been asked what I think about this test, so I decided to take it myself. 

If you haven’t seen this text, check out this video from Pete Whitaker https://youtu.be/Jmn0jiU5VaU (which also has a link to Magnus’ video in the description).

Basically you perform 4 exercises back to back and record your scores. Then, you measure that against a table that places you in an approx grade range/ability. 

For the first exercise (2-arm max hang) on a 20mm edge, I used a rounded 21-22mm campus rung (basically 18-19mm and then the rounding) and build up over four hangs until I did 5 seconds with 145 pounds. It was absolutely my maximum. This is~1.89x bodyweight, but the test jumps 1.8 to 2.0, so I earned 8/10 points. I will say I slipped out of half crimp into open hand during the test for full transparency.

The second test is a two arm max pull-up. I did 145 first try (my PR would be 158ish if I plug in my current bodyweight) and then tried to jump to the 9/10 point weight (170) and failed at about 90° elbows. This means again, I got 8/10 points. 

Third: front lever. I performed 10-11 seconds of good form and another 2-4 of poor form levering, earning my another 8/10 points. At this point, I realized that in order to hit 9/10 or 10/10 points for all of the exercises, it would require some serious work beyond what I already do. This felt sort of like a climbers’ version of the NFL combine. I have done 15-20s(+) levers within the last few months, so I think my poor form was likely due to fatigue and shakiness (caffeine).

Lastly, the 2-arm bar hang for time. Man, this one sucks. I did 3:05 (max points at 6minutes) for 6 points, but I definitely let go a bit before failure since it was so uncomfortable. This was the hardest one for me, and the one I had the least idea on my own performance going into the test. I went in blind, and came out sore. I need to do more strength endurance work if I’m going to become a sport climber.

All in all, this gives me 30/40 points, which is fairly strong for a first effort I feel. I think I could improve my front lever and bar hang score a few points with practice, but the pulling and finger scores I think would take me a good amount of training to move up another point. However, finger strength is something I feel limits me in bouldering, so I am going to
continue training this moving foreword.

30 points settles me in the 8c (5.14b) range. However, I have never tried anything that hard on a rope, so it would take some work to confirm if this is true.

So, what did I learn?
1. I want to film the whole test next time and see if I’m cheating it in anyway. 
2. My forearm endurance (and ability to tolerate discomfort) is severely lacking compared to my other strength metrics. Something I have actually been working on lately. 
3. This was fun, but I feel it fails to highlight the fact that I’m a stronger climber than I am “good.” Meaning, I perform well on a test like this, but I do not think it shows my weaknesses (other than endurance) like technique/efficiency, mental toughness, self confidence, and time/$ to get out and try hard climbs often enough to send them. 
4. If I trained for this test for maybe 2-3 weeks, I think I could realistically hit 35 points (by bar hanging 6 minutes and getting another front lever point) which is 5.15a, but to be honest, I would rather train and climb for boulders and routes not just based on a specific grade/number. Plus, I know even if I maxed out this test fully, I would still not even climb 5.14 just like that, without also sharpening my dullest tools.
5. Finally, this was a good reminder not to take things so seriously and just to push myself harder in ways that foster growth as a climber, athlete, and human. And that maybe I need to project more.
Creatine making me train harder but climb weaker? I've been supplementing creatine (5g every morning with my coffee) for a couple of weeks now and have noticed a slight and perceptible bump with my training numbers.

I've seen noticeable upticks in:

* One arm hangs @ 102 lbs -&gt; 112 lbs (~9.8%)
* One arm pullups, 137 lbs -&gt; 152 lbs (~11%)
* Front lever 5s -&gt; 12s (240%)

That's all well and good, and makes me happy since I'm hunkered down in training mode during the winter anyway. However, I've also noticed a sharp drop-off in on-the-wall bouldering performance indoors. On old warm-up circuits I would notice that I'm significantly more pumped on problems I used to cruise, and on below-limit moves near the top of the wall, I would struggle to keep my fingers from opening up despite the moves themselves being relatively easy. The pump would come faster, sharper, and with much more severity. I would normally take 5 minutes max between attempts to be more or less fresh, but now seems that I need to take upwards of 8-10 minutes to unpump.

I understand that "the pump" is more or less an expected outcome of creatine supplementation, but I was wondering if any fellow climbers here have a similar experience and insight into this dynamic. **How is it that I can both be stronger in isolation, but also weaker in the sport I'm actually training for?**

A few theories:

* Neurological adaptation - or lack thereof. I'm just not "used to" climbing in that pre-pumped state.
* Weight gain - although I haven't noticed any
* Nutritional or hydration based - Perhaps being on creatine demands a change in diet that I'm being deficient in

Anyways, just a shot in the dark considering creatine is a fairly popular supplement and that folks here that train may have experience I'm otherwise lacking. Thanks in advance!

Edit: training numbers (3.5 weeks)

My own pyramid below.

* I climbed mostly trad
* Besides bouldering in the gym I had 0 structured training
* Everything up to "A" was my "discovery" phase  - I was figuring out crack climbing, gear placement.  My trad strength eventually caught up with my sport's.
* I climbed 53 routes in 5.10s-range (many were multipitch), and 11 of  5.11s (mostly single-pitch).
* In hindsight I could have pushed it and tried more 11s, but lack of finger strength and head game were holding me back.

I'd love to see your pyramids!

Climbing product research Hey ClimbHarder,

I’m part of a 2 man band trying to make climbing training more easily recordable, in order to extract data for retrospective analysis, to help climbers reach their goals. We’re just starting out in our spare time and have managed to produce an Android app and are working on an iOS and web app too. We want to make sure we’re building something that actually helps.

With climbing centers closed, we are having a hard time trying to understand how climbing training works, outside of our own experiences, which are humble at best. If you have been training toward a climbing goal whether it be a specific grade or a dream route, a short conversation could really help us cut through the fog.

If you would be interested in having a quick video chat to help point us in the right direction, please drop a line referencing this post to hello@theclimbingapp.com
Very frequent low intensity training for tendon strength So I started climbing again after a very long break a few months ago. My main concern when starting was my tendon strength after such a long break, and indeed I feel like it's been the main limiting factor in my climbing. I'm regaining my strength and technique fairly quickly and I'm back up to V7 outdoors, but I'm open handing basically everything as even half-crimping feels very tweaky. When I don't have to pull very hard it's okay, but on half or full crimps tendon pain is the limiting factor far before strength. I can't even half-crimp deadhang my bodyweight on a 20mm beastmaker edge without pain, but I can add 10kg on open hand and three finger drag with no discomfort. For this reason my main goal right now is to strengthen my pulleys as fast as I can. I've read that even light training is enough to stimulate tendon strengthening, and that it's best to provide this stimulus frequently. What I've been doing is basically doing a warmup on the hangboard with bodyweight hangs on bigger edges every day, even on non-training days, so I can stimulate the fingers frequently without interfering with my actual climbing. Is this a good idea?
3mo ago I couldn't even pull onto this set by Ben moon - "the famous five v6". Haven't trained anything but moonboard and so happy with my progress.
Never crack climbed before but always wondered how hand jams felt, so I drilled some wood together and ended up with a pretty cool attachment for the hangboard. Not as painful as I thought it’d be!
Getting in volume is not just a great way to build strength and endurance, mileage on the rock will also help you become generally more well rounded, technically proficient, and capable of getting things done fast. Here's one way to get volume in-- a v-point challenge!
Wanting to do everything at once Does anyone else find it difficult to choose a part of climbing to focus on? I want to be good at bouldering, sport, trad and alpine climbing. And even within those categories I want to do everything, from dynamic comp moves to fighting my way up offwidths a centimetre at a time.

I think that part of the problem is that I don't have any decent rock near me (London) so I end up doing weekend trips to different places instead of ever projecting one thing. But I can change that.

Does anyone have any advice on how to focus and train in one category. Or alternatively, how to manage to do everything at once? Thanks
one arm lock-off training exercises for shorter climbers Hey all,

I'm a pretty decent climber in terms of numbers (v10/5.14b - I've spent very little time bouldering ), but I know I'm physically probably pretty weak compared to other people who have ticked these boxes.

I'd like to push it a bit and recently tried to do a one arm lock off and totally failed. I'm a 29 year old female and a shorter climber (5'4, neg 1 ape) think this could really help me bridge some strength gaps/make it easier for me to lock off further on big moves.  There's a ton of info out there, but it's almost overwhelming. I'm wondering if there is anyone here who could recommend a decent training program ? my thoughts were to do something like this:

one arm scapular raises

negatives (pull up on 2 hands, lower with one)

one arm 90 degree lock off  with weight taken off progressively , until I get it

However, I can't really do any of that except the scapular raises. I can KIND of do the other 2, but the form isn't good. Does anyone know of any progression exercises, or is it just as simple as taking weight off for everything until I can do it? Also, any exercises that help train shoulder engagement when elbows are not bent (i.e. being spanned out) would also be very helpful.

Thanks a bunch!

OK- some edits after reading the initial comments:

When I say "14b" and "v10" I'm just talking about my max grades here. I wasn't trying to spray, I just am trying to give context. I've only done one of each. In fact, I haven't even done a v9, because the time I've spent bouldering is like maybe 2 weeks , ha! Though I'm fairly certain I have done v9s on a rope.

&amp;#x200B;

But I am a dcent sport climber, plenty of 5.13s, 6 or so 14as, etc.

Style-wise, the 14s are mostly gently overhanging with bad holds , but that's a pretty big generalization.

\---

Also, I dont even think I am "bad" at lock offs. I lock off all the time, it's kind of my go to technique for a big move. However, I think I lack some fundamental back/bicep/arm strength etc.  that would benefit me in this realm and in others.

\---

So, I did look into some max numbers:

Max weighted pull up (1rep) is 45, which is around 39% of my body weightMax rep body weight pull ups is 12

Thanks, everyone!
Free spray wall apps Hey guys

Was wondering about recommendations for a free app to record problems set at home walls. So far I came across 2 options:

Boulder Creator [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=project28.set.share](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=project28.set.share)

Eat, Spray, Love [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.markdgold.spray](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.markdgold.spray)

\---

If anyone has experience with other apps or solutions, I am looking forward to moving my handwritten training notebook to the digital era.
Help me figure out why I suddenly lost crimp strength and haven't yet gained it back? I took 10 days off around Christmas break, almost 3 weeks ago now. Since Early January, I've been back on my usual 3-day per week grind, and after 3-4 max hang sessions across that time, my half crimp is still lagging way behind where it was before the break. To be sure, I expected a week or two getting back to usual, but I'm about 20 pounds off and seemingly no longer making improvements in the right directions. It really is starting to baffle me because even today, after 4 days rest, I was barely able to half crimp a weight that would have been warm up level for me before, and because of the days of rest I'm pretty sure it's not fatigue. Additionally, I have no injuries or sudden changes in my body composition to speak of.

The major things that have changed from before the break to after are that now I'm getting a lot more volume on Lead (with some climbing at grades that are very hard for me, 5.12 and up where I had barely ever ventured out of 5.11 gym territory before) whereas before Christmas I was only doing 1 consistent day of lead per week (now I'm doing 2). So an extra day of hard leading, and I also began to do archer pull-ups twice a week as well (where before I had no additional pull volume outside of just climbing).

I don't know, I didn't think the added volume of climbing and arhcers would have this type of an effect on my max finger strength, and I'm seemingly lagging behind where I'd like to be. If anything I thought the extra volume of climbing would make my crimps stronger!

Any and all help is appreciated.
I tried the Ultimate Climbing Test- result: 8a sport potential. I want to step up my outdoor bouldering this year- debating between building a mini moonboard vs. doing a personalized training program. Keep going back and forth in my mind over which I would see the most benefit from. Thoughts?
Struggling to fit it all in with time constraints from COVID regulations at the gym Hello! Recently I’ve been able to get back into my local gym and start practicing climbing and training again which has been great! The tricky bit is that the gym is only available in 2 hour blocks that you sign up for in advance. I also do 30 minutes of lower body compound lifts at the end of each session. This is kinda helpful in my climbing but really it’s about having a healthy body since I’ve had joint issues in the past and my doctor recommended I build strength there to protect my joints/ligaments.

I go pretty regularly. 5x a week on a two days on, one day off type schedule. I’m around 6’5 195lbs. At my height and weight, it’s really feeling like I lack the finger strength to push into new difficulty ranges (for me that’s indoor v8+) without tempting tendon fate, especially since I’ve ruptured multiple a2 pulleys in the past. Usually the classic physics of climbing would suggest losing a bit of weight but I think I’m at a healthy weight even though I could stand to be at a better bf% (who couldn’t). 

Because of all that, I’d like to incorporate fingerbording in there somewhere to help prevent injury and have some definable progression goals aside from the abstract difficulty ratings of the setters. The thing is I don’t really know if that makes any sense when I only get 90 minutes to climb when I’m there. 

Has anyone had any success trying to ‘do it all’ at the gym in a limited time slot? I’m sure people with kids have had to figure this shit out way before covid, but it’s new to me! 

If you have had success, is there a classic “basic finger strength” protocol for this kind of thing? I hear the word repeater thrown around all the time and I don’t really know what to make of it aside from just hanging on random shit until I fall off over and over at the end of the session.
Upcoming AMA Tom Randall of Lattice Training will be dropping in for an AMA on Sunday 1/31 at 8PM, UK time.  That's Noon pacific time.  


Prep some Qs!
Poor technique on very easy warmup climbs Over the past year or so I've been slowly putting together a warmup routine that feels adequate for me and is very repeatable. Most people I've talked to have told me that individual warmups themselves do not matter so much as I find something that feels like it gets the job done and can be done each time I climb. I've arrived at simply doing an increasingly difficult series of low-graded (V0-V3) climbs until I feel "buzzed" in my arms/fingers. Usually I just swing my arms/hands around and do dynamic stretches very quickly in between climbs.

I usually project at V6-V7 and can flash from V4-V5 depending on how things are going. Lately I've been noticing that my technique feels especially.....mediocre? when I'm doing my warmup climbs. Obviously I can easily send anything from V0-V3. But at times I genuinely feel that my overall technique and performance is far better on my projects than my warmup climbs. When I climb a V1 it feels clunky, strange, and massively inefficient given the difficulty. I switch my foot placement often and sometimes have to rearrange how my entire body is positioned to make the "best" out of the boulder. As stated before, none of these routes are truly challenging for me. I flash all of them. I'm just wondering if other people  here experience the same thing. Perhaps it's a case of not fully engaging my "climbing brain" when warming up on routes that are especially easy for me.
Anybody here hangboard everyday? Just watched [this Eric Horst video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dypY0F6qw0), where he explains the benefits of hangboarding everyday.  Of course, it could be an attempt to sell his collagen supplement, but I am taking collagen before I climb the last few weeks anyway.  So getting past that aspect, what you all think?  Light hangboarding everyday for prehab?  Obviously this will fall a bit into the 'couldn't hurt' category, but I dont want to waste my time if it's not actually that beneficial.

Personally, I have never had any finger tendon or pulley issues.  I do have pretty regular synovitis in a few knuckles though.

Edit: sorry, wasn't meaning for this to turn into a collagen supplement discussion. I've researched that, I'm trying it out, all that I'm good with.
Help keeping arms straight. Been climbing a year and half and still am getting told by very kind coaches who randomly offer me advice at my local gym to keep my arms straight. But it seems when I try hard, I always revert back to a little bit of keeping my arms bent and just climbing quickly, especially in cave climbing. What have you guys done that has helped you to keep your arms straight? Or like the coach said today "hang on your skeleton." Any drills? I also find I have been doing this on the moonboard, even though i realize that when I hang with my arms straight on moonboard it is much easier. Bad habits seem to die hard :P
Not Sure what I should be Training Hi I am 15 years old and want to up my climbing grades. I mainly sport climb and my repoint is 5.11d. I started climbing around 3 years ago but only took it seriously last year. I am competing now in local competitions and even managed to get into the state climbing team. I am fairly strong (hold front lever for 15 seconds and 45kg+ weighted pull ups) but I am not really upping my grades. I am not really that flexible (barely touch my toes) and mainly just pull myself up with my arms or dyno skipping all the bad holds. I was wondering if anyone knew of any drills that would help me work on my technique. Also if anyone has flexibility plan they could link me that would be strongly appreciated. I also cant seem to keep a routine which if I want to compete in nationals I need to change. any help would be appreciated. Thank you good people of Reddit.
Hangboarding (Repeaters): Adding weight that causes me to fail reps vs. staying just below, and always completing reps I'm wondering what you all think will yield to better results when hangboarding. I couldn't find anything concrete.

Would it be better to pick a weight that:

A) Causes me to fail the last 2-3 reps in a set 

or 

B) Is slightly below failure, that's 'hard' but always doable.

On one hand, I know by picking weights that cause failure, I am coming up against my limit which 'feels' right. but when I fail reps, I never feel as tired or 'worked' compared to when I finish all the reps without failing. 

I realize I might not be explaining myself properly. I'm happy to clarify and have a discussion. 

Some context: I have a hangboard plan based on the RCTM repeater plan (intermediate). I'm focused primarily on lead climbing. I have been hangboarding for 2 years, climbing for 5.
People who climb mostly outside, how many projects do you have? Do you usually have a bunch of projects at a bunch of areas, or try to keep it small and focused on a few things and just try those things till you send?
Failing at 80%max hangboard repeaters Hi! 

Gyms are closed so I started working with Lattice Crimpd App. I’ve been climbing for several years now and after a solid three weeks warm up I did their testing session to define my max. I then wanted to move to their 80% 7/3s repeaters that were meant to have 6 sets. The problem is - I barely managed to get 3 sets and got completely pumped. 

What am I doing wrong and what is the best solution forward? 

1. Did I screw up my max hang test somehow? How could I overestimate so much?
2. Was the max hang correct and should I persevere and not worry that I cannot complete 6 sets?
3. Or should I reduce weight?
4. Ort keep weight and increase the edge size (i started with recommended 20mm)

As a checkup - I reduced added weight by 10% and increased the edge to 30mm - then I was just about to be able to complete 6 sets (with a serious pump)

Thanks for help!
Do you value doing the classic lines at a crag or dedicate all time to projecting when time is limited on a trip? Do you value doing the classic easier lines when on a trip and time (and skin) are limited, or do you dedicate all effort to sending the hardest grades possible? I know there’s not a right or wrong answer when it comes to this, but I’m curious to know what everyones thoughts are on this subject.
Hey there! So I am considering doing another edition of my training book... And I have some ideas about things I want to add/expand/change, but I wanted ask for suggestions here. Is there anything you guys think I should add, things you wish were in the last one, or things I could have done better? 

Here the last one, for reference (I think it's still stickied here as well): 


https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_oQ8Zy3mfqUtoXhtXwTmbZ1mxCClJSZW/view?usp=drivesdk

Also, I am considering using a Kickstarter to fund a print run of this edition, maybe even to just to fund my time a bit. In my mind, at the moment, a pdf version would be like $5 on Kickstarter and a print version would depend on whatever the costs would be. What do you guys think of this? Any interest. This type of thing (the money part), is hard for me, so i just thought I gauge interest.

Thanks in advance for the ideas!!
I'm trying to really focus on improving technique relative to strength, especially keeping feet on on long deadpoints like this. Does anyone have any tips? I'm trying to keep my hips into the wall as much as I can.
Birth control I'll probably ask r/climbergirls too, but I was wondering if anyone who uses birth control (bc) has noticed a difference with their climbing ability on hormonal vs non hormonal bc. I have a hormonal IUD and I've been looking to switch to an implant, but part of me wants to try get off hormonal bc completely -- I've read a few articles on hormonal bc limiting strength. Plus the infinite side effects of weight gain, mood swings, headaches, etc... it kind of sucks.

It would be really interesting to hear from professional climbers who use bc as to their preferences -- if anyone knows of any resources of that type, that would be awesome. 

I wish the promising non-hormonal male bc methods would be approved in the US already. So few side effects and so long lasting and simple (thinking of RISUG specifically). But that's neither here nor there.
Bouldering vs Sport Climbing I started out bouldering and have recently been getting into sport climbing. My question is why do I struggle so much when sport climbing compared to bouldering. I can throw for a huge dyno with only two pads underneath me and have no fear. But when on a rope which is inherently safer, Im literally shitting myself in a roof climb. I know I am safe, Im comfortable with falling but I still can't seem to climb my best when on a rope. Thoughts? Thank you!
At what point is coaching worthwhile? I posted a video the other day asking for technique advice, and it made me realize just how far behind my technique is; I'm climbing v7/v8 max indoors with v11/v12 strength benchmarks. My goal is to improve 2 grades overall this year, so a 50% flash grade of v8, session grade of v9 and long term project of v10. Im primarily focused on indoors because I want to be able to qualify for and compete well with my universities climbing team this fall. There's a fairly well known climbing coach Ive climbed with occasionally at my gym, I'm considering paying for a coaching session to help identify what technique issues I should specifically work on. I feel like coaching is usually only for double digit plus climbers though, I'm not sure if it would be worth it yet or if I should just try to study my technique on my own. Does anyone around my level who's tried coaching have any thoughts?
Alex Megos Olympic preparation interview https://www.8a.nu/news/alex-megos-olympic-preperation-interview

I was really excited to see this article, expecting some crazy intense regimen of strength, endurance, and comp boulder training, but surprisingly Megos' training right now is mostly just 15 hours of Kilter/Tension board and spray wall climbing per week. He also does "yoga and some exercises" and says he'll probably add some lead/speed training as comps get closer but this plan still surprised me in its simplicity.

Megos' current training philosophy seems like it'd be very effective in spirit if not volume for the average amateur. The vast majority of training time is spent "just climbing" (albeit on difficult angles and small holds) with some small amount of supplementary mobility and strength. It also makes sense to me that in the off season most training time is spent maintaining/building strength rather than practicing objective specific endurance and technique. All in all, seems like a great example of an effective less is more training strategy.
Thoughts on plan for lifting while climbing? Hi everyone,

First I'll just state my goals and current state. Right now I'm 5'10, 168-170lbs ish and 23 y.o. I am trying to build back some strength I lost during COVID as well as get a little more aesthetic, although the focus is more on strength. I'm looking to put on maybe 15 to 10 more pounds on a slow, clean bulk as I don't want to get too heavy as I like to climb, but I also want to put on enough weight to justify a cut back down to 175 in the future.

I recently have been able to finally get back into the gym. Right now, I am really enjoying bouldering/rock climbing, and want to continue to do that for about 2-3 days a week. I also want to gain back the strength and size I had before, so I also want to try and get 3 days of lifting in as well.

I am thinking about trying the Greyskull LP program as I like the rep scheme and compound splits. I am thinking about doing it as is for 1 or 2 weeks and seeing how sore I am, and if the volume doesn't seem to be too much already, will think about adding maybe 1 or 2 accessory exercises to the end of the sessions.

Does this sound like an advisable plan going forward, or does the volume of training already sound like too much? I know it's also something I need to feel out myself, but I think any general first impressions on this plan could help.
In the past (10 years ago) I was crushing v10+ at about 170 lbs. Right now, after zero climbing for about 6 years,  I recently went to the gym and surprised myself by climbing  into the v5 neighborhood.
My body feels super fucking wrecked.
Anyway, does anyone have any tips or info about coming back home to climbing after an extended amount of time away, and how to approach training to A) not break my soft ass body B) gain strength, while trying not to break my luxuriously heavy cartilage😂
I do understand that this will take time. Like at least 2 years of diligent work.
Have any of you lapsed so hard into softness, and then come back? Can you elucidate your torture schedule?
What tips or hacks do you have to make your home sessions better? Aside from the usual suspects: good lighting, temperature, enjoyable holds, music and so on, is there something you do to your environment to get you really psyched, or just to make your home sessions that little bit more enjoyable? Maybe it's a small thing.

I like to have guidebooks in easy reaching distance to scan through during rests for new or existing project psyche, but the best change I made was the addition of two cheap and cheerful stop watches to force me to rest properly. They're on opposite walls (I always seem to underestimate rest time). I have one for rest splits and one for total session time.
What to do about finger injuries that feel better once you start climbing? Hey All,

I have a little bit of a tweak in my pinky. I think it's an a3, c2, or c1 pulley issue based on the location of the pain, and because there's no pain unless I unless the angle at my PIP joint is &lt;120 degrees. It's slowly getting \*slightly\* better. I took a few weeks off (like 2) and have started to do a little bit of climbing &amp; light hang boarding again in the spirit of active rehab.

I've noticed that the pain seems a little reduced \*during\* a session but then it goes back to more or less the same level it was before the session after a few hours. Is that a valuable piece of knowledge? Should it influence how approach my recovery?
A 6 month retrospective of my previous post on Moonboarding with self-analysis **TL:DR** See video below for direct comparison of three 2017 MB benchmarks from 6 months ago and now. Overall I do not attribute my harder boulder sends to Moonboarding, but it has been very useful in getting better at my strengths and pointing out my weaknesses. From the advice people gave in my last post, I can see (literally) improvement in the way I climb not only on but off the MB as well. The MB remains a bit too tweaky for me to climb on consistently even after fixing some flaws in the way I climbed on it.

---
**Background:** I'm now a little over two years into bouldering, and it's been just over 6 months since [my last post asking for critique on the Moonboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/i3uh6w/critique_my_moonboarding_three_v6v8_boulders_with/). At the time, I had done about 3 sessions on the MB, bouldered outdoors on 12 occasions and sport climbed outdoors 0 times. **My max grades at the time were** V6 outside, V4 flash, V7 on the MB with a V7 flash, and 5.12- on indoor lead. I have now put about 35 sessions into outdoor bouldering, including my first extended climbing trip. **My max grades now are** V10 outside (Free Willy, goal of a Hueco trip, have yet to send a V8 or V9), 4xV7, a few V6 flashes, a 5.12 onsight, V8 flash on the MB, and some V9 flashes on the Kilterboard. In this time I also sent a sandbagged V6 that was a year-long project of mine, and now I'm working the V9 low start.

**In October I made it a small goal to reach top 50 in the US for the 2017 MB set, and I'm currently sitting at 58th with 188 benchmarks done.** Most of that progress was made in October/November, but I saw diminishing returns when I started getting to the harder V7's and V8. The amount of work it takes for me to move up in rank isn't worth the potential toll it takes on my fingers/body, so I am happy if I randomly send a new V7/8 benchmark just once every week or two. I'll still be shooting to finish up the V7's (as of writing, I have 4 left) and start working on some V9's, but won't seek to do this often and only on days where I feel good.

**Personal Metrics:** Same height, same-ish weight give or take a couple pounds (negligible to me). I don't believe my max # pullups or MAW pullup has improved in this time, nor my 20mm deadhang finger strength (still about 170% BW). I have never been able to front lever, one arm pull, or anything like that. I used to be able to do a few 1-4-7s and now I'm lucky if I can pull one. In some ways I may have gotten weaker, but in climbing I've improved immensely (still noob gains probably). In my last post, I said 
&gt;"I am strong on crimps, dynamic movement, awkward/crunchy positions and sometimes high tension moves. I'm weak at pinches, slopers, compression, lock-off strength and core."

I would probably revise that now to:
&gt;I am strong on power and power endurance problems, but the more I have to sustain effort the worse I get. My technique on pinches and slopers still needs work but has definitely improved. I'm more comfortable moving 'from position-to position' instead of 'from hold-to hold'. Still no endurance :)

**Notes before comparison video and analysis:**  Most of the feedback I received in my previous post boiled down to: stop cutting feet unnecessarily, stop full crimping unnecessarily, keep hips in when appropriate and drive through them. Therefore, most of my analysis will focus on those items. 

If anyone still has critique for me please feel free to comment on it! After watching these clips side-by-side I subjectively feel like I climb better, but I know I still have a long way to go.

Also, to keep things slightly consistent, I have not tried any of these boulders in the meantime, nor looked at or discussed beta so as to maintain a more fair comparison to my past self.

---

**Comparison Video and Analysis**: https://vimeo.com/510002308

0:04 : Kickboard at the previous MB location was too large to say the least, so sit starts sometimes were impossible, hence the slight body position/beta difference. 

0:05 : Full crimping on the left, close crimp and mini-pinching on the right. Much better now.

0:09 : Better footwork, better drive through my legs.

0:15 : Same as above. Also not full crimping anymore.

0:24 : Slightly cleaner finishing position.

0:29 : Much better footwork and drive through my feet. 

0:35 : Less thrutchy, better use of left foot. 

0:40 : Kept my hips in, more weight on my left foot.

0:46 : More drive through both feet made the catch easier. Pulling up into the jug made the swing and match easier.

1:00 : Slightly different beta. May or may not be more optimal, not sure. 

1:03 : Hips are much closer in now than before.

1:06 : In the past this was my third go on film, the recent video was my first try that day. I'm confident I can do the end, but my fingers were feeling a bit worn out and I didn't have another good attempt in me. I did the last move in isolation shortly after, but had never stuck it in the past. 

**Concluding Notes**

- My footwork and 'tension' is clearly better than in the past. Sticking higher holds from the kickboard and similar moves are much easier for me now. 

- In general, my body was closer into the wall in all three boulders in the recent video, and I used better positioning to put less strain on my fingers. A lot less readjusting now.

- I'm not full crimping everything anymore :) My half crimp and open hand strength over the past several months has greatly improved, to the point where I much prefer them unless a full crimp is necessary.

- I also feel like I move better, more 'intuitively' on the wall than before. 

- Improved in a lot of places, but I still initiate a lot of movement through my upper body. It's how I have always climbed and it's not necessarily a bad thing! But my fingers can only do so much work, and there are people weaker than me doing exactly the same (and harder) boulders with better climbing technique. This will be a slow and steady learning process.

- Final notes: I don't live 'near' any outdoor boulders, the closest worthwhile crags being 2-3hrs away. There also happens to be a distinct lack of quality V7-9 boulders around me, but I'll be venturing further out soon to snag some in that range. Hopefully that explains my weird grade pyramid.

This whole post is mostly for my review, but if it helps a single person out then that's awesome :). Big thanks to /u/higiff, /u/cungster and /u/deginw for their very helpful comments on my last post.
New hangboarder - how to alternate repeaters and max hangs Hello,

I've been climbing for 7 years, being stuck around V6 and 5.11b for several years, so I've bought a Beastmaker 1000 and started doing 7-3 repeaters every other day and logging my sessions. I don't climb at all these times.

Most people seem to say that both repeaters and max hangs are a good way to improve for training newbies like me. However, I would like to alternate between both as I heard both are not targeting the same energy system (but I'm not knowledgeable in sports physiology).

My question is: should I alternate each session, which in my case is every other day or should I do longer periods of each, for example, 1 month repeaters and 1 month max hangs? Is there a consensus about this on which is better?

Thanks!

Starting out - I really enjoy Emils content and appreciate him putting ideas out into the world in an entertaining format!  On that note - i tend to present information in a much less entertaining format ;) So sorry about that.  It's hard to make physiology sexy!!

I wanted to outline some tendon physiology to help clear up the confusion around Emil's video.  The comments are already blowing up too far to leave any of this in there or on the video itself, so apologies for the separate post.

The finger flexor tendons do NOT generate force - they are simply a chain which applies force to the bone.  Yes tenocytes (fibroblasts in tendons which create collagen) are refractory with an approximate 6 hour "lockout" period for stimulus.  Yes doing short duration 10 min load cycles every 6 hours will optimise collagen synthesis.  This over a long period can improve tendon resilience to injury - but you have to also manage tendon stiffness during this process.

Generally for rehab purposes as you apply intermittent tendon loading strategies for collagen synthesis you do them as long duration loads to prevent hyperstiffness of the connective tissue.

In regards to the huge strength increase from this program.  It is likely due to one of two mechanisms.

1. The most likely.  Increased tendon stiffness from a repetitive Short duration loading program.  When you do repetitive short duration loads you stimulate lysyloxidase to form crosslinks in your tendon.  This increases tendon stiffness which improves the force application properties to the bone.  It also INCREASES injury risk as the offset of an increased performance peak from the tendon.This is what worries me - is that everyone will be doing this program - getting gains - continue to stiffen the connective tissue, and then end up with catastrophic connective tissue failure.  This is similar to doing power blocks before a performance phase to stiffen connective tissue, short duration loads, but doing it ONLY as a tendon stimulus (and removing the muscle and nervous system elements).
2. Current ligament issue (not tendon).  If he was suffering from a pulley issue on initial testing - loading the pulley submaximal in a non compressive state might have reduced inhibition of his finger flexor tendons and even not doing his old overloading training strategies may have allowed for remodelling and improvement of this pulley.

Regarding finger health - short duration loads aren't great at remodelling tendon due to stress shielding mechanisms in the tendon.  This would be a great finger health program if the load durations were longer but still submaximal.

This program would also likely not be enough stimulus to get these kinds of gains anywhere else.  Either in the muscle unit itself or recruitment of the nervous system.

Either way - I think the causality and understanding of the physiology behind what is happening here is presented very poorly.  I complement them on acknowledging their experiment being a single person case study but I would love for them to have a more complete understanding.

Sorry for the long read!  Feel free to ask any questions and I can try and answer them with research papers or some really great conference talks from Keith barr, jill cook and other world leading tendon health experts.

Quick Note-  I'm trying to get back to comments but do have to work clinically today as well - ill take time over the next few days to address as much as I can!
Advice on using a home wall in the winter? So I have a home wall that’s outside. Where I live it gets down to the 30’s in Fahrenheit (about -1 Celsius) I’ve found it to be *usable* during the winter but it’s hard to find motivation when it’s this cold. Any advice?
Adapting to outdoor footholds I’m a V7 5.12 climber, over quarantine I was able to get outside more and since then I’ve been hooked. I still haven’t gotten used to the especially small feet when compared to those at my local gym. Any advice for getting used to the tiny feet?
Pushing past 5.9 after stagnating My climbing journey started about 3.5 years ago and I often feel like I am not much better than a beginner still. I think part of the issue is that I struggle at gym bouldering more than anything. My current work situation means I am away for 2-3 weeks and home for 2-3 weeks and every time I come back to the gym I feel like a heavy sack of shit and it takes a few days to get back to my low normal which most people achieve after 4-5 months of bouldering it seems like. I am 6'4" at 215lbs, but quite lean - most of my weight is concentrated in my calf &amp; thigh muscles and some people have commented how I have a poor weight distribution for climbing. I recently started working on pull-ups as previously my max was 1-2. Climbing wise, especially outside I have probably not pushed myself hard enough - I have dabbed into 5.10a sport leads and trying to get solid on 5.8 trad. I love moderate/alpine multi pitches rather than cragging which I sometimes find frustrating due to the lack of options I have at the grades I climb.

I hope to split my time climbing between Skaha &amp; Squamish this summer when I am home. At work without access to a wall, I have started to use the Metoliuos rock rings to improve - I am also working on doing pull-ups &amp; general core strength. 

Looking for suggestions and realistic expectations on how I could improve and use my time wisely. What are some good ways to seek out climbing partners. I have set myself the goals of 5.10c sport, becoming a solid 5.9 trad leader and would love to climb up the chief.

Thanks for your insight.
Moonboard Discussion place Hi there! New moonboard enthusiast over here. I wanted to find a place where I could discuss moonboard problems with people online but realized there isn’t really a place to! I was hoping for a subreddit for example. Anyone know if there is a discord or something? For example I was hoping for tips on how to lift off starting holds of far from the madding crowd 😅, I find climbs that start on F5 and j5 easier starts but these two holds feel very difficult to start on
Weekly Community Setting Thread? With the massive increase in popularity of home walls and the number of supporting apps for setting them, it would be cool to do a weekly setting thread where you can share your homewall and have people set boulders for you.

To save people just dropping in and posting their wall then leaving without contributing it could be done on a gentleman's agreement i.e 2 people agree to both submit a problem on each others wall. 

This would be extremely beneficial for people without a dedicated group of climbing friends, or if you are the most experienced in your group and are looking for some fresh boulders to try.

You could also request the boulder target a specific weakness of yours i.e body tension, pinches etc. 

Thoughts?
Why shouldn’t you train to failure? So I was watching a YouTube video last night with Yves Gravelle (worlds strongest fingers?) and in this video he said he never trains to failure. He attributes a lot of his progress to this and always training fresh (not tired/fatigued). When asked why, he wasn’t given the time to give a proper answer. 
There’s some old video of Malcolm Smith which has always stuck with me. He talks about always ‘ending strong’ after a board session which seems to be a similar kind of sentiment. 

When I first started getting into training I remember hearing more experienced people talk about the key to making gains in strength is trying really hard. Often people say things like those that succeed in their training put in that extra rep or whatever. This kind of thinking would probably take someone into the mindset of training to failure? 
Is this perhaps a misguided myth or is there something being lost which means there’s still a place for this kind of sentiment. 

Something like consistency is a golden rule for training is not training to failure another? 

Interested to hear people thoughts on this.

Video is here : https://youtu.be/UrEyRdKGFx0
? Max-Hang-Pull-Up ? So a friend said this to me a while back. They had been training hard for a trip to magic wood. Doing 1arm max hangs and some max pull up work (lots of other stuff I’m sure but not particularly relevant..). They’d felt good, and were stronger than they had ever been. After the trip he said the training had not transferred into being able to ‘Pull Harder on small holds’. He was really dissatisfied with how his training had transferred. His solution was to combine a weighted hang with a pull up. Which he claimed had transformed his training. 
I know Mani the Monkey was doing a similar kind of thing, one arm hang/pull up on a small edge. One of his mantras is that pull ups don’t transfer to climbing unless the edge used resembles a climbing hold. I would add this changes depending on level. For example a beginner would probably benefit from pull ups on a jug. 

Clearly this guy had reached an impasse with his training and needed to mix it up. There’s also something to be said about specificity here. 

I’m sure a lot of peoples training consists of these two exercises in  isolation. Has anyone got experience with this kind of combination training? 
Was this guy barking up the wrong tree and could have just done... X?

What he was doing does seem to be a fairly elite protocol. The main reason being the ability to pull up the weight needed for the right intensity to work the fingers in a terms of max strength. 

Is there some takeaways for less elite climbers: 
For example I am currently doing weighted pull ups 5x5 @85%. Have made a good pulling base. As the weather starts to dry up I could switch to do doing pull ups on a /14mm/20mm edge with 0 weight added at first and built up sets/reps/weight added. In this way I could potentially ‘consolidate’ those gains?

Gunna preemptively say that people  don’t do this kind of training because of the increased injury risk? Like any form of training this can be controlled...(how is this more dangerous then pulling on holds when climbing. The synthetic environment of the finger board should be easier to control?)

Sorry about the convoluted post, is pretty broad/messy. My excuse:  I’m bored as hell!
Should I bother training power endurance? As title, I'm trying to improve my sport climbing. Currently I do ARC/endurance and  10 move linked boulders along with hangboard, and lots of hard bouldering on a board.

Basically  as per title what's your thoughts on training power endurance on top of this? Am I best just training it on the lead up to good sport climbing conditions or is there benefit from training it more regularly?
Lets Talk Sport Climbing Alright, i'm curious to see how training differs for all of you sport climbing friends out there. Also wanted to prompt some discussion on the nitty gritty and see what people's opinions are. So here's some talking points to get some discussion going:

**1. Periodization vs Non-Linear Progression**; How do you split training time between the various energy systems?

**2. Hangboarding**; do you prefer max hangs, repeaters, or something else? Do you cycle between protocols?

**3. Movement Tempo**; While redpointing does your style tend towards faster, efficient movement? Or slower, deliberate movement?

**4. Tactics**; Share any interesting tactical tips you may have!
Thoughts on Lattice 365 I was just made aware of Lattice Training's monthly subscription [https://latticetraining.com/product/lattice-365](https://latticetraining.com/product/lattice-365/#reviews). Anybody here tried this? Is it worth it?
was anyone's 9c strength test score actually accurate? The 9c strength test (dead hang, max hang, lsit/front lever hold, and max pull up score) I've been watching a few videos of people doing it and it seems to be like we all just have shit technique because according to the test 7a climbers actually have 8b+ strength. 

Obviously I know it is isn't 'accurate' but it does seem to be flattering with some ridiculous discrepancies and I've not heard of anyone's score coming out to what they're actually climbing or anywhere close. 

Asking just for fun and curiosity really: everyone else thinking it's massively overestimating? anyone's score come out anything close to their current grades?

Shaking Hello! I was wondering if someone could help me out. Its being a year since I joined the world of climbing and I still shake (a ton) while I climb. It doesnt matter if its easy or difficult, I always shake. Is there any solution to it? I wonder if its my core strength or just a my mental game. What do you people think?
Thank you!
Improving on Slopers I'm struggling to hold big beastmaker style slopers. I already know body position is paramount here.  Let's assume I have a good body position - COG under plumbline with as positive a direction of pull i can manage. I climb on them. a good amount and cant seem to hang the awful ones on the beastmaker, or other big slopers

I hear 3 finger drag is great for building sloper strength, which is sometimes true for smaller slopers but doesn't seem to translate as well to the big featureless slopers. 

My theory is that these types of slopers rely a ton on arm and wrist flexion strength, though i don't see wrist flexion exercises or arm flexion exercises suggested often in this sub.  Why not?  Am i missing something?
Pebble Climbing App Hi, 

Let me know if posting about something like this isn't cool, but I've seen similar posts on here about new apps and nothing seemed to bar it in the rules.

I've been working on a fairly comprehensive climbing app that's part social network, part guidebook wiki, part gym setting management, and, lately, part training log. As I've started adding more goal-setting and workout features, I realized this community would probably be my target audience. It's a bit of a mouthful to explain, so here are some links to videos that explain features this community would be most psyched on.

Let me know if you have any questions or can think of other features you would want in an app like this. I'm still adding updates weekly-ish and have a bunch of ideas around goal setting and training that I've yet to implement.

[Meta] Can we please stop giving medical opinions to people with injuries? E: Y'all are bringing up great points about access and expense. Perhaps it would have been better to say "diagnose injuries" as opposed to "give medical opinions." I understand doctors visits are expensive, and small injuries that you only feel while climbing don't feel worth a $300 visit to have someone tell you you have a sprain. My wording may have been a little harsh. My hope is that we can be thoughtful about the advice we give especially to people with more serious injuries.

Title. I'm a DPT and see a ton of posts of people asking what they should do for an injury, and they haven't been seen by a medical professional yet. I understand people in the climbing world enjoy discussing anatomy and talking about climbing biomechanics, but we really need to be pushing  people here with injuries to see medical professionals. Yes you may have had what you think is a similar injury to OP's, but there's no way to know that their type of injury and amount of damage is identical to yours. 

Y'all are smart people and I admire that people here want to help each other out and take their own health into their hands, but people with injuries need to be seen in order to know exactly what's going on. There's no way to know just from text.
Do fat gripz help? I cant climb at my gym right now because I am in another city which has no climbing gyms I will be here for around 4-8 months, and the only thing I have is a pull up bar and a store that sells cheap demix fatgripz, hangboards are pretty expensive, does a fat grip help and will it maintain my strength?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT FOR FUTURE PEOPLE: here is a link I found from Magnus -[https://youtu.be/YGcuXgYVteE](https://youtu.be/YGcuXgYVteE)
Is full crimping a necessary skill? I've climbed a maximum of a couple v10s, typically though I'm in the v8-9 range, and I always considered half-crimp strength one of my strengths, mainly going off lattice benchmarks and subjectively on crimpy climbs. Id say my grip is almost purely open hand or half crimp, most common a sort of 80% half crimp where index a a little shy of 90° and my ring and middle are about or slightly over 90°.  I've never full crimped, It feels really hard to get into never mind pull off of. My thumb only reaches my index, so it feels like I'd blow up my index trying to put much pressure with it. If my crimp strength is good enough to climb harder without it, is full crimping really worth it?

edit: clarified what I meant by "crimps are a strength", it was kinda confusing in context
an injury totally changed my climbing...for the better? Hi all, long time lurker here, first time poster.

TLDR: I bumped my onsight grade by from 6c+ to 7b by stopping worrying about the grades I was climbing.

Just wanted to share something really interesting that happened to me in my climbing in the past month.

Back in September I fell off my bike and broke my hand, I had to take off ~4 months of climbing completely, didn't do much of any training except cardio because i couldn't use my hand.

I live in France around a lot of good climbing, so I was typically climbing 3-4 days a week outdoors and had just broken into the 7a+ (.12a) grade, with maybe 2 sends to my name. I had maybe climbed 4-5 7as ever and they were always very hard. I was super obsessed with the idea of just constantly pushing my grade and trying to climb harder routes.

After getting injured it was the first time I ever took time off climbing really, after only been climbing for 4 years.

After finally getting the OK from the doc to climb, I was just so psyched to be climbing anything, I didn't even care the grades I was climbing. 

The past month I have been climbing after 4 months of zero training outdoors or even weight lifting, just running on the treadmill. The bizarre thing is that all of a sudden I am on-sighting everything I get on, every 7a+, every 7a I decide to get on, I am usually onsighting 90% of the time. Had only tried once ever to get on a 7b prior to the injury, got on one this weekend and onsighted it. 

I am absolutely blown away by how much my mindset has positively affected my climbing - I am speechless. Not to mention the increase in grades, I am just having so so so so so much more fun. The only thing that is different from before is the fact that I have removed expectations from my climbs, I get on everything with literally no projected outcome 

 I know that I've always read so many people saying to stop obsessing about the grade, just focus on having fun but I found it very difficult to ever remove myself from that mindset.

Just wanted to share this as it has been so eye opening to me and maybe others have experienced this as well?
Trusting your body post injury I have began on wall climbing after I ruptured pulleys in both my ring and middle finger. After having done 2 sections at the gym I want to talk a little about regaining confidence to put weight on my finger. Now, I know I can't put full weight on them and I can't just dyno around and expect to be strong on them, but what ways have you rebuilt confidence to put weight on fingers post injury. 

I imagine there is a fine line between pushing yourself and being cautious and right now I am pushing on the side of caution.  

Part of gaining that confidence is continuance healing and strengthen of t hat finger, but another part of it is mentally being able to trust putting weight on my finger. Part of me fears that I will just blow a pulley again and be right where I started months ago. 

In part I am asking for advice, but also a possible discussion on your experiences and thoughts on post injury confidence, and the fine line between pushing yourself and playing it smart.
Significantly stronger in my left arm then my right Basically as per the title, I've noticed lately that I'm significantly stronger in my left arm then my right. I'm right handed so if anything I would've thought it would be the opposite.

For example I can do a ~20 second lockoff with my left arm, but maybe only a top of 2 seconds with my right.

Anybody know why this might be/what I can do to even things out? Seems like no matter what I do my left ends up being stronger, which is frustrating because it's not my dominant hand so when it comes to low percentage or high intensity moves I naturally use my right even though it might be more beneficial to use my left.

Thanks in advance!
Bouldering alone; what do you do to get psyched? So I’m on a climbing road trip in the south east and would like some advice. When I get to the boulder field I just want to loaf around and enjoy the outdoors. It takes a lot of effort to get myself psyched for a day of tryhard bouldering. This is only a problem when I’m bouldering alone outdoors. What do you guys do before your session to milk it for all its worth?
What are my biggest technical mistakes? Hi guys,  

I've put together a video of clips from my climbing over the past 3/4 years and I'm looking for any advice you can give me in regards to improving my technique.

[https://youtu.be/dlc\_0-QuilI](https://youtu.be/dlc_0-QuilI)  

To give you an idea of my current ability I'm able to send most v7's and below inside, and occasionally do v8/9/10's. Outdoors my current hardest climb is a v8 dyno and a handful of v7's.   

&amp;#x200B;

Bodyweight: 70KG -75KG

Height: 6'2"

Max hang two hands beastmaker 1000 outside bottom crimps: +70KG  

Max hang one arm beastmaker 2000 middle edge: +12.5KG 

1-5-8 on a campus board with 20mm (ish) rungs 

Max 1 rep pull up: +60KG  

My mobility has generally been pretty poor but I feel I've made huge gains in this area and is becoming less of a weakness. 

&amp;#x200B;

My stronger styles tends to be powerful, dynamic, overhanging, compression boulders 

My weaker styles tend to be techier, balancey, position orientated boulders  

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips would be greatly appreciated!
New climber here. A little confused on the grip terminology took these pics on some climbing holes in my stairwell so sorry fo bad quality. So from what I'm understanding pic. #1 is an open grip, #2 is a half crimp and #3 is a full crimp. Is this correct?
How to prepare my body for climbing after a year-long break? Hi there!  


I didn't really know where to post this, but this subreddit is probably the best match for the topic.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the lockdown (#CzechiaBestInCovid), I haven't really had the chance to climb in the last year (and probably won't get to climb for a couple more months). I am mainly an indoor climber (mostly boulders) but I have nothing against climbing outside (I just haven't been climbing outside because my skin and body can't take it after such a long break).   


Since I don't want to begin anew once the lockdown is lifted, I wanted to ask you for some **exercises** and **tips** on how to get my strength back up. I unfortunately don't have a hangboard or even a pullup bar, due to the glued chipboard doorframes, so any kind of exercise with those is sadly off the table. I do have a couple of rubber bands (10 and 20 kg, IIRC) and maybe some books for weights. I suspect the lockdown will be lifted in 3 - 4 months, so that's probably plenty of time to get at least some of my strength back.  


Thanks in advance!
Tryharding a route as a beginner? I am extra beginner  ( only 5 outdoor bouldering sesh)
and i found a cool block that I can finish  but on this block there's a non official very difficult route ( maybe  short 6c /7a? ) and obviously its too hard for me. But i make progress on this route and its a matter of weeks till i can finish it.

Should i  keep tryharding the route or just move to other boulders?
At what grade did you have to start training? Im interested what the grade point was for different people when just climbing a lot wasn't enough to keep progressing anymore and you actually had to start training for it in order to keep getting better. For me, im at 7B now slowely breaking into 7B+ and i feel like it is becoming harder to keep progressing by just climbing. I am still improving though, becoming a 7B+ climber by just doing my curent routine of climbing feels possible but above that i feel like that would be hard. So, what was your "just climbing only isn't enough anymore" point?
Structuring Moonboard Sessions Hi everyone,

I’ve been messing around with a Moonboard at my local gym recently, and started wondering how other people choose which problems to project. Like probably 90% of climbers, I can send *some* benchmark problems at higher (for me) grades, but I’m still nowhere near finishing all the v4s. 

For anyone in the same boat, how much time do you devote to staying in your style and ticking a few “harder” grades? Or do you force yourself to finish every benchmark before even looking at other stuff?

I know there’s no right answer here, and obviously it depends a ton on goals, but there aren’t a ton of other people using the board at my gym and I’m curious about what others do with it!
I tried Emil Abrahamsson's hangboard routine, here's what happened I have just finished the 30 day hangboard routine. I was fairly consistent to begin with, but 10 days after starting, I just did it once per day, and I also missed one day, and this was mostly due to other commitments, and not being able to fit two sessions into each day.

To fit this into my climbing routine I do normally which is two days on and one day off, I used the hangboarding as a warm up to board climbing on my small home wall, which is a 45 degrere woody thats 6ft by 9ft. The routine also coincided with the start of the outdoor climbing season, so I would do the routine as a warm up before going out climbing.

I did the hangboarding on three edge sizes and a variety of grip types. I did 3 sets of 3 finger open crimp on a 24mm edge, 3 sets of half crimp on an 18mm edge, 2 sets of middle two fingers on a 24mm edge, one set of first two fingers on an 18mm edge, and finally one set of middle two fingers on an 18mm edge. 

I started on the 9th of February and I had a few 'benchmarks' recorded from the 1st, so I used those as my base for seeing if I got any stronger. I don't have any weights so they are all a test of what I can hang from, and for how long, and it would be intersting and probably a better test if I had weights to see what my max hangs are.

On the 1st of February my benchmarks were:

12mm half crimp for 25 seconds

18mm front 3 half crimp 25 seconds

18mm back 3 half crimp 10 seconds

On the 11th of March, my results were:

12mm half crimp 35 seconds

18mm front 3 35 seconds

18mm back 3 25 seconds

8mm half crimp (beastmaker micro) 5 seconds

I could also hold a one arm hang for the first time 2/3rds into the hangboard routine so I tested that too. I could hold the 18mm edge with one hand for 5 seconds on both hands on the 11th. 

My thoughts on this are obviously that my results are much better after this, but it would be interesting to see my max hang as a % of body weight before and after, but since the walls are closed where I am, and I don't have any weights, I can't do that. I also think that just climbing on my home wall will have changed these results quite a lot compared to just hangboarding.
How to stop climbing at my limit I have this problem where I'm constantly pushing myself trying to climb hard routes that are at my upper limit, or beyond it. Everything else just bores me. This is good for progressing, but since I'm doing it all the time, it is also a source of constant injuries, which force me to quit climbing for weeks at an end. 

Any advice on how to tackle this type of mentality?
Struggling with lower level boulders So ive been climbing for about a year (though a good chunk of that I had to take off due to COVID) and im relatively good at top rope but absolutely suck at bouldering. I can do most v1s and the occasional v2 but really struggle doing anything past that. The past month I’ve strictly been bouldering since my boyfriend isn’t climbing currently due to college and tennis. It’s been really frustrating getting stuck on basically all the v2s except for one. I go 3 times a week and try to focus mainly on v1s and try some v2s in the middle of my session. Any advice on how to improve my bouldering? I also think fear has a big play in it since I’m scared of falling, so if anyone has any tips on how to overcome that that’d be appreciated too! I’ve been trying to practice being more dynamic by jumping off mid route and doing a dyno on a V1 but feel kinda ridiculous that I’m kinda flailing around lol
High heel hooks, toehooks, getting more comfortable stretched out It seems like every new set at my gym, there's more really high and stretchy heel hooks and other flexible foot betas that are necessary to do the climbs. I'm really having trouble improving on these, I didn't think I was particularly inflexible, but it seems like most climbers can casually get a heel to their head almost and I'm way behind in that regard.  Have any other inflexible climbers managed to make significant improvements with this? I do basic hamstring stretches and I do side split stretches, but it doesn't seem to be helping that much.
Made this video to share a suggestion for maintaining better tension and efficiency while executing dynamic movement. Hope its helpful and enjoyable!
My experience hangboarding 2x/day for 4 weeks Hey everyone! I just wanted to share my results with the "Emil method." All of this is subjective, and I certainly didn't do a great job at logging pre-program results, so I don't have a ton to compare post-program results to. 

BACKGROUND INFO / PRE-PROGRAM

Before starting this program, I'd been training mainly power since November without a deload/rest week. My fingers, joints, etc had been feeling great, but I was still obviously due for some healing time. My finger training before this program was mainly 1arm isometric pulls for 5-7 seconds, with occasional density hangs and campus boarding strewn in. Before, during, and after this program, I used callogen supplements, creatine, vitamins, and ate clean. 

PROGRAM DETAILS

I hung twice a day for four weeks, always at least 6 hours apart. Occasionally I'd be able to hang, climb, hang with 6 hours between, but most climbing days I just used the hanging before climbing as a warmup. The first week I did 10 seconds on, 50 seconds off x 10 sets. The next week and a half I did 20 on, 40 off x 10. The final week and a half I did 20 on 40 off and 30 on 30 off x 10 depending on how I felt that particular day. I didn't use any type of scale to monitor how hard I was pulling, but I'd say I stayed around 20-30 percent effort, depending on how my body felt that given day. I primarily did 4 sets half crimp, 4 sets open crimp, 2 sets pockets. I did zero other finger training during this time. 

HOW I FELT DURING THE PROGRAM

The first 1-2 weeks were amazing! My fingers felt flexible, strong, and healthy. My shoulders started to feel a little angry towards the end of week two, so I tried to use a pinch block when I could. By the end of the program my shoulders felt totally fine again. 

A week into the program, my fingers felt really strong while climbing. I felt like I could noticeably keep power in my fingers for longer while doing this program. However, one thing that was incredibly obvious during this time was finger soreness the day after a limit climbing session. For the past couple of years, I could limit boulder, max hang, and campus board without feeling any soreness the next day. This was the first time my fingers felt achy the next day, which was interesting. 

For the final two weeks, my fingers started to feel a bit tweaky. They felt very stiff, I found myself having to constantly stretch them. I could feel pain and knots in my forearms where I've had injuries in the past. I wondered if I was overdoing things, and I really made the effort to decrease intensity for the final week. 

POST- PROGRAM

I took a deload week after week 4, which I was way past due for even if my fingers hadn't been feeling tweaky. During this week, I had an outside bouldering day and a couple of low volume max hang days. My fingers didn't "feel" strong, but I was able to keep power on small crimps way longer than I'd been able to in the past on a longstanding boulder project. The max hangs didn't feel great, I held back a bit due to the tweaky scar tissue feeling in my forearms/wrists.

RESULTS

After the deload week I tested my fingers. Right before this program I did 175 percent body weight in half crimp on 18mm. After the program I did 160 percent

Right before this program, I held 12mm for 26 seconds. After the program I held it for 38

I held a 6mm half crimp for 6 seconds last June,  after this program I held it for 9. I think I could've gone longer, but my skin was terrible and I was a bit fatigued from the other tests

The most surprising result was last night (almost 2 weeks after ending program) when I did 1arm isometric pulls on 20mm and pulled my feet off the ground for a couple of seconds. I've never been close to that in the past and really was quite shocked by that

My forearms still feel a little bit stiffer than they did before, but my fingers don't feel nearly as tweaky as they did towards the end of the program and overall are feeling strong and healthy

OTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTORS

The most obvious factor that can play into my results was taking a deload week. I'd been training really hard for a long time, resting my body would obviously amplify my performance with or without this program. Right after this program, my weighted hangs were less than they were right before it, but I think a lot of that had to do with holding back due to the tweaky feeling and having to jumpstart my nervous system into remembering how to try hard again. 

My bodyweight had been pretty heavy for me since November, and I've lost some weight by really focusing on my diet recently. This obviously would affect my results. The 6mm test is also highly subjective as I hadn't tested that for a long time before doing this program

HOW I'LL IMPLEMENT THIS IN THE FUTURE

For me, the first two weeks were the sweet spot. I think in the future, I'll do this again for 2-3 weeks every couple of months. And maybe limit it to once a day with a second max hang or submaximal hang just a few times a week. 



Thanks for reading, happy training out there!!
How Did You Break Past the V3/V4 Plateau? Just starting to get back into climbing as my climbing gym only reopened a couple of weeks ago. I'm mostly back to where I was in late 2020, being able to send most v3s and around 50% of v4s. However, that's where I was at pre-COVID and haven't made much progress in completing v5s or beyond. Is the jump to the next level typically a strength issue or a technical issue or both? How have others broken past this (I believe) common plateau?

Edit: Wow, thank you to all who responded to this post! Am climbing later today and will take everyone's advice to heart.
Bodyweight workouts to train for big wall climbing, hauling and jugging specifically. In about 3 months, my partner and I will be making our first trip to Yosemite Valley and hope to take on our first big wall. Although we plan on practicing these skills on rock as much as possible, I am looking for any suggestions of bodyweight workouts to add to my routine that will specifically help with jugging and hauling. Any suggestions appreciated.
Anyone have stories of hearing a pulley “pop” and it *didn’t* end up sidelining them for a month+? Edit: ok so it seems like no matter what, I shouldn’t climb on that finger for a while and am canceling my trip.  Any advice to keep strong at climbing / stay at the climbing gym while I’m rehabbing the finger?  Maybe one handed practice on easy TR routes, splinting the finger and staying at easy routes &amp;amp; doing endurance work, idk.  Just don’t want to lose the strength I’ve developed since my last injury (wrist/cycling accident in December)

————-

Not asking for medical advice as I have an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon on Friday!

Mostly just want to hear your personal stories of physically hearing/feeling a pop but it didn’t end up being that bad at all.  For... hope, i guess.  I have a big climbing trip coming up in 2 weeks and am so nervous that the doctor is going to tell me I can’t climb for over a month.

I’ve been climbing for 7 years without a hand injury and prided myself in taking very good care of myself... and now this.  Was my 2nd session of the day so I started on a slightly crimpy but not *too* crimpy climb I’ve done a million times and suddenly heard the dreaded pop.  My finger isn’t swollen and still has mobility, but hurts to pull on anything so I made the doc appointment right away.
The importance of circuits and structured board sessions for targeted gains in major bouldering strength categories Hi all!

I was thinking about how I've been attacking my board sessions the last few months and thought I'd make a post about it to spark discussion and add to the conversation. 

To preface- I have a home wall; like many people created during this past year. It's a 8x13' spray at 47 degrees with a very high density of "old school" and wood climbing holds. I try to climb on it 3-4 times a week, which with the rest of my schedule can be difficult some weeks.

How I've been structuring my sessions:
I created circuits of boulder problems a few months ago at different difficulties to work different skills at climbing. 

Tier I: relatively easy boulders that I have sent. I use the boulders in this tier for:
-4x4 training for power endurance
-re-sending things (I agree with Kris Hampton of Power Company Climbing on why this is important)
-longer circuit sessions in which I try to send multiple projects instead of working harder moves on fewer routes

Tier II: Boulders that are current projects, usually to be sent within a session or two (up to a week), but that still have single moves that are at my limit.

Tier III: Boulders that have multiple moves at or beyond my limit that are longer term projects (weeks to months)

Tier IV: Project-project level boulders that have multiple insane or tricky moves that I sort of know I'll either never send or at least will be extremely long term projects. Good for testing myself and trying really, really hard.

During a session, I use my circuits to guide my time and effort. 

-After a warm up of probably 30 minutes, I start with single moves on the Tier I problems to keep warming up my fingers and get me ready to try harder moves.

-During some sessions, I dedicate the whole session (1.5 hours) to sending as many Tier I problems as possible

-During some sessions, I spend relatively little time on these problems, to leave me fresh for Tier II or Tier III problems.


All of my sessions (3x/week) are 1.5 hours. With the exception of one longer session on Sunday that I leave free to do a longer, more languorous session in which I basically just double my time in each tier.

I feel that this method gives me the ability to work on multiple abilities for hard bouldering. Ranked in order of importance, I think:

1. The ability to try really, really, really hard. Tier II-IV boulders give me moves at my limit in many different categories that force me to reevaluate dogmatic ideas about technique, realize strength deficits, work on applying technique and power concurrently, etc. And to focus up and work on trying really, really hard on individual moves, which is always necessary for limit sends.

2. The ability to actually send boulders. Working things lower than my absolute limit allows me to build the power endurance and mindset necessary to make links and top boulders on an actual trip. This part of my climbing was lacking when I purely limit bouldered, so I have incorporated it into more of my training.

3. The ability to fluidly address weaknesses and structure sessions on the fly. I can adjust how much time I spend in each circuit with high precision, focusing my time on what I feel I need for outdoor sends, instead of simply trying to find boulders that fit those niches in each session. 

That's it! I feel like I have gotten much, much stronger in the last few months with this method of focused sessions, rather than much more time spent fretting about fingerboard numbers and weighted pulls. Climbing centric, but still very structured to eke out maximal gains that are always directly transferable to climbing. 

What do you think? Are there pieces of the puzzle that I am missing? And for those of you who dont have access to a board that doesn't change, what can be done to recreate structure while gym climbing?
finger strength calculator is [https://strengthclimbing.com/finger-strength-analyzer/](https://strengthclimbing.com/finger-strength-analyzer/) accurate. It has been a year since I have been climbing, and i started training, so i am unable to determine whether the results are accurate.
How to improve stamina/endurance for longer routes? Hi all!

I’ve been climbing for 2 years now and I just started outdoor rope climbing (woohoo!). It’ll be my main focus/goal for this outdoor season. My climbing gym only has 24ft top rope/autobelay walls. Most of my anticipated outdoor projects this year are at least double that length. Plus I want to dip my toes in some lead climbing this season. 

My question is, how can I improve my stamina and endurance without pumping out so quickly? My climbing partner advised to do laps on the autobelay in the gym. But can I do more?

Thanks in advanced for your answers!
Relaxed Hangs for Shoulder Health It seems that a well documented treatment for shoulder impingement and pain is "brachial hangs" or just hanging relaxed from a bar. These were popularized by Dr. John Kirsch in his book "Shoulder Pain? The Solution and Prevention" and they seem relatively popular with some research to back their effectiveness.

My simplified understanding of the physiology is that a lack of space between the bottom of the acromion and humerus is a common cause of shoulder pain and tissue damage. When hanging relaxed, the humerus pushes into the acromion, which helps open up more space in that joint and relieves pain and increases range of motion.

See links for more info:

This is the exact opposite of what climber PT's seem to recommend for hangs and we are commonly told if you hang without engaging, this is bad for the shoulders. ([https://theclimbingdoctor.com/hang-right-for-shoulder-health/](https://theclimbingdoctor.com/hang-right-for-shoulder-health/))([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTJudXtucpE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTJudXtucpE))

It seems that the outward rotation of our scapula is important for creating space in the shoulder joint with arms over head. However, when we engage like we are often told (squeezing shoulder blades together), we prevent this outward rotation and it seems that this could be problematic? This video explains what I'm trying to get at: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2shm\_Jz0WQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2shm_Jz0WQ)

Why such a difference of opinion? I could see how important it would be to have shoulder muscles engaged during a dynamic move with a lot of force or if your feet cut, but just hanging on a hangboard with relaxed shoulders seems like it could be beneficial?

Has anyone experienced positive or negative results with relaxed bar/hangboard hangs? Why are we so scared of hanging in a relaxed position?

Would love to hear from some climber PT's on their thoughts related to relaxed hangs!
Hip Mobility routine for Climbers - great stretches for getting Stronger and more Flexible Hips (High Stepping and Froggying)
Why Climbers Should Deadlift &amp; How to Do It - Hooper's Beta https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifNyUw2fEBw

From the show notes:


In this episode we are going to talk about why the deadlift is helpful for climbers. More specifically, we’ll be delving into the Romanian deadlift, which I believe to be the most useful for climbers. We’ll get into the reasons why in a bit, however, if you’re curious about the other two forms, you can find a bunch of information and instruction on how to do them in the show notes. Most of what we talk about in this video will be applicable to all three types of deadlifting, though, so no worries there. We’ll discuss the specific anatomical benefits of deadlifting, the proper technique so you can perform it sately, and how to integrate it into your training routine for max climbing gainz.

SO WHAT IS A DEADLIFT?

Before we get too far into it, let’s actually talk about what a deadlift is, so let’s get down to the basics The term deadlift comes from the fact that you are lifting “dead weight,” meaning there is less energy stored in your tissue before you start the lift. This is different from many other exercises which start with a lengthening of the muscle which helps create energy before performing the actual lift, such as with a bench press or squat. The “dead” weight is lifted up to approximately the height of your hips and is done so by engaging multiple muscle groups such as hamstrings, glutes, core, quads and back. To do so effectively, one must maintain proper tension throughout the range of motion, which is one reason it is so useful for climbers. There are many adaptations or variations to a deadlift as well, whether it be with the form or the weight used. Traditionally, a deadlift is used with an olympic bar, but kettlebells, dumbbells, and resistance bands can also have a role. 

As mentioned before, we will focus on the Romanian deadlift form in this video, because of its application to climbing, but the show notes will also cover the conventional deadlift and the sumo deadlift. The conventional deadlift focuses more on the quads, glutes, core, and mid back whereas the RDL is more hamstrings, glutes, core, and mid back. The sumo works the glutes, quads, core, and mid back. So the real difference is conventional deadlift = more quads, RDL = more hamstring, and sumo = more glutes. 

Choosing which one is right for you really depends on your goals. BUT! In my opinion, the RDL is the best one for climbers. It works the hamstrings the most which is ideal for heel hooking, and it has a smaller range of motion than the conventional deadlift so it can be a bit safer! Win-win in my books.
How do you prevent pulley injuries? Look, I've been climbing seriously for 4 years and have gotten A2 pulley injuries on every one of my main three fingers (index, middle, ring). Recently I've remained injury-free for a good 4 months and I thought I had it nailed down - hangboard the crimp to warm up, don't do stupid throws to tiny crimps, icing occasionally. But just last session I dry-fired off a crimp and this morning, I feel tenderness in A2 pulley of my index finger. It sucks. 

What do you / athletes / pros do to minimize the chances of getting injured like this? It just doesn't seem possible to NOT get injured. Help!
Starting New Training Plan **-- Preface --**

Hi all, 

Just thought I'd make a post vocalizing my own training plan, feel free to critic and maybe even take a few notes for your own training protocols. 

I've always tended to go a little overboard when it comes to training, going hard far to quickly and ending up injuring myself. As such with a few recent finger injuries, I took a 3 month break just climbing occasionally and easily to keep everything in relative shape. 

Now feeling refreshed and a little psyched, I begun a my new training plan. With a higher focus on antagonists, technique and slowly building up the intensity by establishing a solid pyramid of grades. 

**-- Goals --**

Just a quick brief on my own goals and reasoning for certain exercises and focuses.

1. Middle splits and general mobility.
2. Becoming a more technically sound climber, focusing on tension and not just brute strength.
3. Pushing the higher double digits and getting that dream grade **v13**... one day haha

**-- Monthly Plan --**

Each month is worked around a 5/3/1 [Protocol](http://www.t-nation.com/workouts/531-how-to-build-pure-strength) I'm using for my conditioning exercises (Weighted pull-ups and Bench-press).

These percentages are based off my **2RM**, not **1RM** as I don't want to overwork myself with these exercises.

-- 5/3/1 Protocol -- 

*Week 1*

1. Set 1 // 65% x 5
2. Set 2 // 75% x 5
3. Set 3 // 85% x 5 PLUS (additional reps till failure)

*Week 2*

1. Set 1 // 70% x 3
2. Set 2 // 80% x 3
3. Set 3 // 90% x 3 PLUS

*Week 3*

1. Set 1 // 75% x 5
2. Set 2 // 85% x 3
3. Set 3 // 95% x 1 PLUS

*Week 4* DELOAD WEEK

1. Set 1 // 40% x 5
2. Set 2 // 50% x 5
3. Set 3 // 60% x 5

**-- Weekly Plan --**

My weekly plan is divided between conditioning and climbing days. This is purely because I'm stupid and get too excited to climb and always end up neglecting my conditioning exercises. As such, I need to dedicate time to focus on one or the other. 

*A little side note, due to medical reasons my recovery is rather lackluster so trying to fit everything in has been quite difficult. As such, I've only devoted 2 days a week to climbing and other 2 for conditioning. I'm on the fence only having 2 dedicated climbing days, but I'm eager to see how it goes over the next couple months* 

**-------------**

**Sunday - Conditioning**

1. Weighted pull-ups (5/3/1 Protocol)
2. Simple repeaters 12mm (7 on 3 off // 8 reps // 3 sets) 
3. Loaded stretching (lower body)
4. Static stretching (upper body)

----

*Note 1: Repeaters are kept simple and unweighted, till I'm confident with my finger recovery to start implementing max hangs again. Also note, I include a lot of moonboarding, which already is quite finger intensive*

*Note 2: The stretching mainly focuses on lower body, as I've always been woefully inflexible. I'm following a guide by [Antranik](https://antranik.org/hamstring-flexibility-guides/), who I highly recommend for mobility guides.*

*Note 3: As mentioned by _meishan_ in the comments, these include 'loaded stretches' which both strengthen and stretch the muscle. Allowing myself to have strength whilst in these extended positions. E.g. horse squats.* 


---- 

**Monday - Conditioning**

1. Bench Press (5/3/1 Protocol)
2. Incline bench (10 x 3 low weight)
3. Wrist curls and reverse wrist curls (10 x 3)
4. Single arm tricep extensions (10 x 3 low weight)
5. Stretching

---

*Note 1: This conditioning day is focused on my pushing muscles, something I've always neglected. So far I've seen great benefits in my posture, body tension, and reduced elbow pain (tricep tendonitis).*

**Tuesday - Rest day**

1. Play some TFT
2. Eat loads of food
3. Good nights sleep

**Wednesday - Climbing**

1. Dedicated warm-up
2. Moonboard flash session (2016 ver.)
3. Cooldown and frontlever progressions for fun
4. Stretching

--- 

*Note 1: As mentioned before, I'm focusing on building a solid foundation or pyramid of grades. As such, I'm basically going through all the benchmarks one by one. Starting at v4 and working my way up.*

*Note 2: Each problem I'm recording my flash attempt, then analyzing my movement and then climbing the problem again to perfect my movement. E.g. I might have cut-loose unnecessarily, as such I'd attempt the problem again and focus on my body-tension and do it statically. I'm really enjoying this process, especially when forcing static beta on more dynamic climbs.*

*Note 3: Another reason for this static and tension focused climbing, I feel it puts less strain on my fingers. As I'm not jumping and latching holds, loading my fingers in an uncontrolled manner. That being said, as I approach the higher grades I plan to have built a solid foundation for my fingers to begin loading them more dynamically.* 

---

**Thursday - Rest day**

1. The usual

**Friday - Climbing**

1. Dedicated warm up
2. Simple Repeaters 12mm
3. Moonboard/Outdoors (projecting)
4. Cooldown
5. Stretching

---

*Note 1: Projecting will usually take place over a few weeks, initially working individual moves. Followed by linking and then finally redpoint attempts.*

---

**Saturday - Rest Day**

1. The usual

**-------------**

**-- Conclusion --** 

Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk, I know it's probably a lot of personal anecdotes. But I hope it's helpful to those currently working on their own training plans. Feel free to critic, I'm open to feedback and suggestions :)

*Edits: Formatting, typos and added more information to 'weekly plan'.*
Any suggestions, best practices and good ideas for a beginner lead climbing coach? Hi,
I'll have my first paying clients as a sport climbing coach and I'd be very interested what kind of sessions, excercises you do with your clients and what good know-hows do you have for coaching roped climbing?

I have my ideas but I'm really curious about what others do, since where I live (pretty big city) there aren't many very knowledgeable coaches - at least by my standards-  who do lead climbing coaching.
I have theoretical knowledge about this, and my own experience as a sport climber but it is always more interesting to have some personal opinions.

Thanks!
Just Climbing Training So I'm 3 weeks into a strength and power building phase of a sort of structured training plan I've assembled based on Eric Horst's Periodised Training Plans. I'm due to enter into his 4 weeks of "just climb" training after this and his instructions are a bit vague. I realised I could just do what I always do in terms of going around and climbing a bunch of random stuff but I've realised that I could probably make it more structured and disciplined based on what I've come to know about motor skills acquisition and the underlying theories behind it. So I'm giving a shot at coaching myself on how to just climb better and I thought you guys might be interested as well or provide feedback or whatever.

Here are summary of the basic principles:

1. We produce overall **ideas** (schema) of skills from repeated practice trials. Motor learning happens when our **ideas** are continually updated during practice by comparing the outcome of our performance (result) vs what we pictured in our head (schema). Learning occurs when one adjusts the schema to be more successful given the parameters of the practice trial.
2. Motor Planning and learning are composed of two parts: Higher order thinking conscious planning - **stuff you can put into words** and lower order automatic sensory coordination (visual, muscular awareness, incorporation of other senses)  - **stuff that you can't put into words but can feel** of planned skill movement.
3. Motor Learning can occur through: **direct learning** (learning that this is both the "correct" response and that this is right combination of sequences to do it) and **observing** (watching a person carefully, imagining how they conceivably did it, asking them about how they achieved something)
4. Motor Performance is dependent on Perception/recognition (**beta reading** \- reading the problem, situation, recognising and understanding all the important problems and factors), Decision making **(beta reading -** creative problem solving and choosing from a list of strategies to solve a problem) and Activity Production (**technique -** motor planning on how exactly you would execute the move and of course following through w/ said plan)
5. **Variability** seems to promote acquisition, retention and performance over and above repeated block practice. Repeated block practice seems to only outperform variable learning with regard to the specific problem practiced. Variability in almost every parameter: different learning strategies, context, timing, pace.
6. **Immediate and specific feedback** the ability to be able to self determine immediately on the spot what went wrong is invaluable to accelerating learning.
7. **Focus of attention -** external focus has been found to be better - focusing on the effects that a person has on their environment -  as opposed to internal focus - focusing on the fine coordination of muscular movement. For example, I think an appropriate example would be feeling the tension generated by your body from toe to chest pushing you up the wall as opposed to focusing on the coordinated action of curling of your toes or squeezing of your butt or tightening of your thighs on the wall.
8. Motor Learning occurs better at submaximal effort
9. Make it playful

As a result of these principles that I'm aware of, I've generated the following practical rules for myself with regard to bouldering:

1. When I'm off the wall. I need to watch **observational** preferably a large group of climbers solve 1 particular problem: could be strong climbers flashing it and/or the weaker climbs struggle through or gracefully solve a problem **variability.** I also need to give myself **immediate feedback** as to what allowed them to successfully get over the hump.
2. When I'm in skills acquisition phase, I will limit myself to 4-7/session good tries on a particular move and then I will move on. If I feel like I'm using 100% of my conscious effort to hold on, I will drop the boulder. I will not relentlessly project things and I will try to be good about moving on to a more digestible version of the problem after 1-2 sessions of trying it.
3. When I'm doing a problem. Beforehand, I'm focusing on **recognising** all the elements involved. Then I will not go on until I can **creatively generate** at least 2-3 possible **solutions** to various parts of the problem. Then I will select the best one. I will focus on the **external** effect of my body on the wall: the leverage, the force generated, the stability felt, the momentum experienced, the angles my body adopts to conform to the wall.
4. I will try to record as much of my climbing as possible and watch **immediately** after to generate immediate feedback c**omparison** of what I thought I was doing and what i actually appeared to be doing.
5. I will look to introduce variability based on my performance parameters. If I want to improve and perform better on beta reading: I will go to a new gym or crag and only give myself 5 minutes, competition style to do a boulder and then move on. If I want to do a certain move, I will go to the spray board and try to creatively generate various version of the move, easy and hard. preferably on all sorts of different angles. If I want to get better in terms of overall flow of climbing: I will look to climb something 4 times, varying up my speed from fast to slow or slow to fast and everything in between. etc
6. Have fun.
7. I will introduce a test phase at 2 weeks and 4 weeks of skills building in order to test and generate feedback on particular areas that require improvement.

TL:DR I'm bored at work and instead of procrastinating, I'm choosing to do something remotely productive. Wrote up instructions for myself on how I should do "just climbing" sessions. Key aim is to focus outwards, find immediate feedback, observe everybody, get as much variability as possible, structure beta reading, have fun, test myself during the middle and end to see what I'm week at.
Rubber on same foot keep wearing off fast So I am taking a bunch of shoes in for resole and I just noticed that the same foot (Right) is always the one that i am blowing the rubber through, the left is always fine!

Any interpretation on what this means from a technique perspective? Is the obvious answer that my footwork with my right foot is worse than my left? Would be great to use this as a learning tool :)
How to lose as little as possible, if possible, on a thru hike I'm hiking the Continental Divide Trail for 5-6 months, usually about 25 miles a day, 5-7 days a week. I'm really not looking forward to losing all of the progress I've made climbing, so what are creative ways I could try to at least keep some strength while on this trip? Hangboard on boulders near trail? Pull ups on tree branches? Or is it a futile effort, and something that I should just get after when I get back?
Working on pullups Hi guys, 

So I've been climbing for about 6 years and would say I'm am solid 5.12+ climber. I've been trying to up the number of pullups I can do so I can eventually build up strength for one arms and muscle ups. However, people are usually surprised when they find out my pullup limit is around 9 with ample rest. Usually I do 5 sets of 5. I have a male friend who can bang out 20 without training for them. Do pullups come easier to some people? I understand the biological differences between men and women, but honestly for how long I've been climbing, I feel like they should come easy to me. 

Thoughts? I've been doing my 5 sets of 5 pullups around 3 times a week, I climb outdoors around 1-2x per week and I do workouts (mostly weight training, some calisthenics) 6 times per week(this includes my climbing).
5 Minute Stretches helpful for improving Climbing mobility - target stiff shoulders, chest, back, quads, hips, wrists etc (Full playlist) [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGhYA9mI0GcNZXlK9a7vNB67gYrp5CAYW](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGhYA9mI0GcNZXlK9a7vNB67gYrp5CAYW)
What do you wish you could tell yourself? I recently pushed into 5.11b on TR and some V4 (one V5!). This felt like a fairly significant barrier for me. If  you could give yourself  advice, training or otherwise, when you were around these grades, what would it be?

Dave Graham is a Wizard [Dave Graham is a Wizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2bZsFZdpgs)  


There's a whole new crop of climbers who have no idea what wizardry is. So I wanted to call attention back to an old Dave Graham interview. This thing is a classic and worth the watch, despite the awful video quality and some of Dave's slightly more insane ramblings. u/milyoo 's transcript/notes from an [old thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/3vcf9f/movementmentalphilosophy_dave_graham_the_wizard/) may be a bit more digestible:

**wizardy:**

yes. sorcery and wizardy. nobody takes it seriously. the projection of wizardry, its an idea. it doesn't really exist. i don't know. it's in sci-fi and fantasy books. when i watch a big strong someone do something i'm not surprised, but when i do it there's some wizard shit. \* the application or example of when wizardry exists. inexplicable. fucked up shit that doesn't make sense.\*

i've known the solution for years. i'm just in the basic stages. still practicing. i made it through my crux and opened new realms. bailed on a method and tried a new method. i'm sometimes maniacal about a system. to get through. talked about a ton of different shit. i'm more intrigued in doing it another way as a representation of something I couldn't do. forcing a way. find my way. until I realized climbing isn't about methods i don't need. why put yourself through undo stress and worry about something you don't need to. there's no explanation. *wizardry is realizing your own powers rather than conforming to a system that doesnt work. fuck the system. fuck this beta.* radicalize yourself if it doesn't feel good. "you should do it this way" - fuck that. it doesn't work for me.

**unsatisfied with his problem solving:**

I was hurt. lost confidence. I want to develop this physical form and add them together with focus and concentration. if i don't focus i don't do well. i need to focus on rock climbing desperately. if i do i'll always see a method. my problems will always be physical. i'd probably be able to do it if i could do it. the speed and the mind.

**People who Train:**

getting strong becomes the main problem rather than the situation of solutions. you need specific techniques. need power-core. also realms of doing things on a mental level. boulder problems. pure specific movements. structure. core. more stability. if you can prepare: it's not about locking off everything. *being weak you learn a lot about how to use your body. you apply yourself. you need to be weak/lack of ability to learn to look hard enough. (the method is the optics)*

**techniques strategies processes:**

wizards can make themselves do whatever they want. you can always fool yourself. *disguise reality and try to convince yourself of how to believe.* lie to yourself. tell yourself. convince yourself. everything is so mentally possible. he forgets. difference between him and a 7C boulderer. he isn't so much stronger as he just sees where they go. where to put your body. you kinda see. it's odd. repetition and position. keep moving the body around. when they do it right then they're like "oh". feel the positions to learn they are true. it's all technical stuff. understanding little angles, positions, all these little lines that cut around you, these spaces you have to be in. so spatial. people can't understand that math and that geometry. to know where the spaces are. your ass is out of the box. \*there's all these lines cutting through you, imaginary spaces. if you can be in those imaginary boxes then you'll be just fine. and once you get to the next hold the box alters and you move into the next box. some people feel them more naturally and some people dont see the lines and dont feel the boxes.  
\* secrets. sharing. talk alot. be apart of everyone climbing. gather together and make improvements. maybe like this? interactions are always inspiring. do things that aren't technically correct. make fatal mistakes.

the year 2020. there will be strong people. i'll be 39. i hope to be like Ben Moon. there will be 10's, 9c+ is over. it's all combination. two 9a's isn't that bad. depressing if all we get is combination (no diversity of limb mobilization). 8C-8B+-8C.

the crux on Realization is 7B+. it's pathetic. it makes you feel like a dumbass.

futuristic bouldering will be a combination of really strong, really dry skin (conditions), and incredible technique with body positioning on holds. you can't do that because you sweat.

**plastic and rock:**

the processing speed the young learn in the gym is way higher for plastic moves. but it's not always applicable for rock climbing. plastic will go its way and rock will go another (prescient shit here). you can't do these wild progressive things you learn inside outside because people like me will find methods around them. no matter what. it will never be the pure jump that they want. unless its a really unique thing, like the most unique jump in the world. pure jumping rad shit. and then i'll be impressed like hell because i really love pure things. the processing power of rock climbers looking for things is going to be beyond the gym climber's one dimensional thinking, walls in the gym aren't complicated enough. they don't involve as many structures. they don't have as much variation. indoor climbers are strong indoors and outside they can't get in the positions. *it's spatial. they concentrate on grabbing things in a simple way. they don't concentrate on finding the difference and variation in (between) positions.*

*it looks simple to them - there's no affect and no theories - i can't just do it.* i cant just grab it and jump. there's more to it. i need to not be scared. it's key. they look at you like you're confused.

grades. people can never reach where nature reaches. chipped routes will never be futuristic. we reduce it to a state of nothingness.  
"
Measuring climbing grade for data analysis? My climbing partner asked me an interesting question the other day - how many kg in weight loss corresponds to an improvement of a grade for me? I'm dropping weight right now and he wanted to know what I would be expecting at the end of the year, ignoring technique/strength improvements of course.

Being a data geek, I couldn't resist the challenge: plot my climbing level against weight over 8 weeks, do some regressions, and see if it's linear or whether a polynomial fit would be better. Then extrapolate out to fall.

So of course the question is how to determine climbing level at a particular time. I'm thinking of using the benchmark that Justen Sjong uses in his programs - hardest 4 routes that can be toproped clean in a single session. Is that a good measurement for week to week comparison, or do you guys use something more specific - for example hangboard times?
What is the most important lesson (or thing) you have learned through climbing? I am relatively new to climbing, I aspire to boulder and eventually outdoor climb as well. 
I want to know what is the greatest takeaway that you personally have had from the climbing? When I say lesson or takeaway, I am thinking about something that you have learned, an insight you have gained, or knowledge that you have acquired through being in the climbing community that you didn’t necessarily see or expect to see coming. It could be a tip someone shared about technique, it might be a single quote you’ve seen/heard, it could relate to a greater life lesson that YOU have learned personally, it could be just a story about a meaningful moment with yourself or with others; i’m leaving the door wide open here... 
I’ve been craving more intimate conversations and what better place to start than here. The subreddit floor is yours:
I trained a Procedural Generation model to create new problems on my Spray Wall and I developed an App for it (BoulderBot) Hello everybody! After I built my own woody I started tinkering with Procedural Generation (a.k.a. "Artificial Intelligence"), creating a model to automatically generate new boulders on my wall, and I started to develop an App (BoulderBot) to allow anyone to use it on their own home/gym Spray Wall or Training Board.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1czbrjyi0rq61.png?width=4320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65d58bb6afd77879891858bbb5eb3589af837964

&amp;#x200B;

The generation model is still experimental and under development, it's not perfect but I thought I'd start sharing it since we're all locked up again (hopefully for the last time). It is fairly articulate (it generates full problems, including Start, End and dedicated FootHolds) and can be customized using parameters like Difficulty and Length.

My goal was creating a tool that can be used to generate on demand new dedicated problems depending on what you want to train (endurance, limit, technique...).

Don't expect immaculate setting straight out of competitions right now, however personally I still found it very useful to get some variety and novel problems/movement patterns on my wall. I designed the App to allow immediate edits to the generated boulders if you want to tweak them (in general I spent quite some time trying to make the App as easy to use and solid as possible).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The App works by importing an image of your wall, using an interactive wizard to insert all the necessary information (height, angle, position and relative difficulty of the holds). After creating the wall, all other functionality (generating new boulders, creating new ones manually, saving, filtering and searching them) is immediate and requires no extra setup.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This version of the App is free, I have a lot of plans for the future and, in addition to improving the generation model and the general look and feel, I am working on a metric ton of additional features, some of which will be available in a paid Pro version.

It works completely offline, all the walls and problems you create are stored only on your device. I'm planning to add sharing and public wall options for gyms, but you will still be able to use the App completely offline.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If anybody wants to check it out, right now it is available for Android 4.0.3+ (iOS version coming soon):

Wow!
I can't one arm hang from a "flat jug". Hey guys. 
I found that i can't hang from the BM2000 biggest hold which is a full hand (3 pad) hold. I should have a finger strength to do so, but i have the feeling that some shoulder muscles are not strong enough to do so. I immediately start rotating. I can do a few one arm pull ups and i can hang without rotating from a bar as long as i want without rotating, but when it comes to a flat hold where i can't put my thumb anywhere i just can't. 

Can you tell me some exercises or which muscles might be the weak link that stop me.
Ok, I got strong. Now what? I was first exposed to climbing about 6 or 7 years ago and had been climbing on and off until 2 years ago when I started climbing consistently with the goal of actually getting better. I hadn’t done any climbing-specific training until lockdown happened and I was left without access to a gym. I picked up a copy of “Training for Climbing” by Eric Hörst, set up my dangleboard and weights, and got to work. Fast forward a year. I am now able to hit 4+ one arm pull ups in a row (from not being able to do a single one before), crank 5-rep sets of weighted pull ups with 60-65% added body weight, and do 10 sec weighted hangs on the 14mil with 50% bw added. I also trained up to a 15 second front lever (I think I scored around 9a on the 9c test).

With all of this extra power, I did see results. I improved my max redpoint from 12c to 13a and my max boulder grade from V6 to V8. I’m not complaining about the progress I’ve seen, but I recognize that most people that have a similar level of strength climb way way harder than where I’m at. The logical conclusion here is that my technique is pretty garbage (which it is).

The question that I have for you folks is this: where do I go from here to become a *better* climber, not just a stronger one? Right now, I train 4 days a week, two of those being days where I just climb and two of them being days where I just do climbing specific exercises. Should I be switching up my routine to focus more on climbing and ditch some of the strength workouts? Are there any things that I should focus on during my climbing sessions that would help me improve my technique?

I’d appreciate any thoughts/advice/tips from anyone, but especially folks who feel like they have been in a similar spot as me or are straight up ballers (you know who you are ;) ). Interested in hearing what you have to say!

For other info about me that may help people make suggestions, I think my personal climbing strengths are power, endurance, finger strength, and route strategy. Conversely, my weaknesses are flexibility, body positioning, movement economy, and balance. I am mostly a route climber outdoors but train at a bouldering gym.

edit: I don’t want this to come across as spray, this comes from a place of humility. I hope responses to this can help others as I think this sub tends to sometimes be overly focused on just getting stronger, much like I have been the past year.
Advice on 30+ M for getting better bouldering gains As the title says looking for feedback on how to over come either a plateau or see better progress in climbing strength as I continue to age. Looking to peak at V8 or 13a by 40 if that is possible (5years).

Some baseline metrics are outdoor V4+ and proj 5/6's. max pullup: 50%bw. 18mm hang (7s): 50%bw. Climbing style static/controlled, weakness: pockets. 165lbs. 4 years climbing experience (started at 31).

I tend to climb hard 2x a week and another casual day bc im usually fatigued from cross training or just life in general. My workouts are about 2x a week (non-climbing days) with focus on body weight fitness and antagonistic muscle groups to even out imbalances. Cardio maybe 2x a week since the weather is getting better. 

So I already know more time on the wall will get you better for climbing and quality over quantity. Just seeing if there was any wise words from the older crowd since im considered "old" by my gym standards who climb at the level I do at my local small gym.

Edit: height 5'10 with +1
Average time a climber spends on the wall Hello,

I wanted to make an endurance hangboard routine with a duration similar to the time it would take to climb a route. This made wonder how long it takes to climb 5.15s like 'La Rambla', 'Biographie' and others. I had trouble finding any uncut videos of these climbs. I know routes vary greatly in their style and length but if anyone has personally climbed or seen a 5:14/5.15 or has a uncut video please share the total time on wall as well as the name of the climb.

Anyways, I'm open to hearing personal experience with any grade as well. Just looking for a ball park. 

Personally, I feel like time on wall is between 8 and 12min depending on the climb. Does this sound about right?
Free coaching for r/ch. I'll help you program your climbing &amp; training. You help me improve my coaching skills and materials. I've been putting together materials for coaching &amp; training for quite a while. I want to help motivated climbers reach their goals. I have a huge amount of real world climbing &amp; training experience, and some informal coaching experience of individuals and kid's teams. I want to get some practical experience with coaching and programming while I continue working on my academic credentials.

Since this subreddit has given me a ton of knowledge and value, this was the first place I thought to look! This forum is FULL of people asking the big questions about training, and lots of small questions too.

If you're interested (and not currently on a training plan) fill out the thorough self-assessment below. If you're a good fit, I'll ask follow up questions via email and get other resources like videos of you climbing. Based on the info I'll build you a proprietary 4 week plan of strength training, climbing activities/drills, and extracurriculars. There are no templates, I will create each plan by hand. I am more focused on climbing technique, tactics and minutiae than the current trendy hangboard protocol, so back and forth will be essential for me to get to know you and create something useful for you. If it goes well, I'll be back to do another round of free plans in a couple months.

About me:

* 34, climbing since 2007. Training age ~12 years
* Web engineer by trade
* First v10 in 2011 and many since, at least one a year. Still improving.
* Climbed up to v12 / 5.13c
* Done almost every hard boulder in Oregon and developed up a good chunk of them

Okay, if you're still with me, here's the assessment. It should take about an hour. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwx8QDW9xMvIt31OUiwPhq0TOp7RFC-9gu2TwsrEx6kpFwQA/viewform

Disclaimer for the cynical: This isn't a hailcorporate post. There are no strings attached; there is no money involved. Just a guy looking for some mutual benefit and trying to give back to a helpful community.

**Edit**: DANG this blew up! I have gotten a ton of responses to the form. It's going to take me a while to get through all of these, and I won't be able to make plans for everyone. However since you all took the time, I promise at least some bespoke advice for anyone who submitted the form. Thanks for participating!

**Second Edit (4/8)**

I just wanted to make an update to let anyone who submitted it know a couple things.

First, I have gotten a TON of self-assessments (at least 10x more than I guessed I would get) and I assure you I am getting through them slowly but surely. If you still haven't filled out the form, it's still up and the offer still stands. I am having fun reading about everyone's climbing and learning a lot!

Since I have never emailed the people who filled out the form, I think some mail providers have decided that I'm a bot and started putting my email in spam folders. So, if you filled the form out, please check your spam folders. I'm not a bot :(

I will post another reminder about the spam folders in a few weeks.
Strategy &amp; Pacing for a 3-day Weekend Headed to Rifle soon for my first multi-day climbing trip, and I am curious to hear opinions and tips for this length of trip. Yes, I realize this is a short trip in the grand scheme of climbing. 

Do you pace a 3-day trip, or just go all out each day? How many goal routes would you have for a 3-day trip? 

Background: onsight 5.12a/b in the gym, one outdoor 5.12a onsight under my belt, many 5.11+s. Hoping to tick off at least a couple more 5.12s on this trip. Have been following the rock prodigy training protocol for one cycle, and this will be the first multi-day trip after starting this training regimen)
Just got today some Physivantage supercharged collagen powder, to see if I see some help with tendonitis and ache in arms. Would anyone be interested in me posting about results after 2 weeks or so?
I could use some help on a training plan for a parent. Hey, I’m wondering if any one else is in the same boat as me I have a 2yo and trying to get a good training plan and keeping up with dad life is getting to be a hard balance. I’m still a remote worker till June, so I really wanted to train hard before going to full time on sight work. I have been climbing for about 5 years now I mostly only climbed for fun and exercise so I have never really trained hard at it. I do Boulder outside as much as I can which is every couple months or so when I can get a group to go and set up my daughter for a sitter. I’m only bouldering at v3-v4 in the gym currently I can comfortably do v1 outside as well. My main goal is to at least climb v3 outside comfortably. So realistically I can get in the gym twice a week should I just be doing one day volume and one day max? What would be the most value for the session. At home I have a pull up board, hang board, and a kettle bell. So any training recommended for those would be greatly appreciated. My kid usually naps for about an hour or so, so I tend to workout in that window. Any and all tips or recommendations for a training plan is greatly appreciated! Thank you!
Lock-off vs. Deadhang in one-arm hangs Everytime I'm getting closer to being able to hang a certain hold one-handed I can always hang it first in a 90° lockoff and then weeks or months later in a deadhang. So my question is: Is the 90° lockoff position better at being able to output max effort than the deadhang or is this just a sign of some underlying weakness I have?
Kyle Knapp (Moon Board admin) interviews Steve Maisch about training, Moon Boarding, and *lifting* rocks I recently stumbled on Kyle Knapp's podcast Friction Addiction. There are a bunch of good episodes, including ones with [Steve Maisch](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/20-steve-maisch/id1480837010?i=1000510226522), [Ravioli Biceps](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/19-ravioli-biceps/id1480837010?i=1000506624129), and even [Ben Moon](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-14-w-ben-moon/id1480837010?i=1000472280695) himself. I haven't listened to them all but I thought these might be interesting to the community, and I haven't heard this podcast mentioned before.

Kyle is a prolific Moon Boarder, and also a Moon Board admin. If you've climbed on the Moon Board, you've almost certainly done his problems (most of which are pretty stout — La Rose et la Moon Board V6 is hard af!). He's also relatively big at 6'1"/190lbs-ish, and as a fellow bigger hard boulderer myself I really appreciate hearing from guys like him and Jon Glassberg who can actually relate to what it's like crimping close to 200lbs.

The Steve Maisch interview goes into some depth about how Steve uses the Moon Board for training. One really interesting takeaway for me was how he determines his max grade on the board:

1. The highest grade he's sent — V(N) — such that…
2. He can also do a workout consisting of V(N-3) x5 + V(N-2) x5 + V(N-3) x5

(Jon Glassberg alluded to this in [his Nugget interview](https://thenuggetclimbing.com/episodes/jon-glassberg-part-2) in an aside about how strict Steve is in determining when he can proceed to higher grades.)

So in other words, it's not enough to just have done one 7C. For that to count as your max grade, you should also be able to do 7A+ x10 + 7B x5 in a single session. As someone who has done a boatload of Moon Boarding since February (222 benchmarks) that seems just about right to me.

There's some other good stuff in the interview. Hope you all find it interesting.
What helped you improve your climbing the most? Was it arm strength, finger strength, flexibility, mobility, technique, etc., a combination of all of that?

Get specific. I wanna know if there’s anything you started training and then saw good improvement. It tends to be very unique for everybody so I’m very curious!
Video Technique Analysis - Looking for Constructive Criticism and Missed Weaknesses Hi everyone. I've been a regular user here for a little over a year now and this subreddit has really helped to push my climbing ability. I've come to the point where I think I am ready to post my videos online for strangers to dissect and I would love for anyone with the time and knowledge to analyze them and point out some weaknesses.

My stats: 30 years old, 5'11, +0 ape, 170 lbs.

Max hang: Never truly maxed out because I ran out of weights at home. Hung 130% BW for 10 seconds on a 22 mm sharp doorframe relatively easily.

I've linked each video below with my quick breakdown on where I could improve.

Unfortunately the only climb I have on there that I've spent more than one working session on is the Black Plague v6 climb, so might not be great at showing me struggling at my limit.

1. [Black Plague v6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftRVxpoZ6zY): The first foot slip is something that happens to me all the time when I climb. I need to get more comfortable keeping my heels lower on smears, and I need to continue to push through the whole move instead of letting go of pressure. I haven't gotten to the top many times, and every time I get up there, I end up flailing. I think the correct beta is to span the feet across, keep tension to move my left hand over to the right, then bring my body over underneath my arms and top out. Practicing intuition climbing should help me when I get into unfamiliar territory like this.

2. [Ketron Classic v4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHU70tas3UU): I felt this Bishop classic was relatively soft for a v4, at least compared to others that I've tried in the Bay Area. I think it went in around 6-7 attempts, with most of the attempts spend figuring out how to hold the sloper and span my feet. Here I think my pacing is a bit slow, and could have been faster. Tons of hesitation before big moves. I also have a bunch of hand adjustments, but I would say if I had spent more time on the problem I would likely know better where to place them. Nervous foot bob at 28 seconds, which is definitely something that I need to clean up, since I do that a lot when I get nervous. I also feel like I generated a lot of swing on that dyno, which I will address in the next video.

3. [Planet Granite v5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOJ-o4mcwak): I found this problem harder than v5s on the kilter board at 40 degrees. I wasn't consistent with the move at 10 seconds until i really focused on moving my hip over my right foot and keeping my core tight, especially since I'm not great at smearing. Still a bit of sag. The dyno at 22 seconds is really concerning for me. My entire body spins and contorts, which is really rough for my shoulder. I notice this happens to me quite a bit when I cut loose, which means I'm not doing something right with my lower body, and putting my shoulder in danger. Would really like to figure out how to hold my body when my body is swinging out free. The next move is something Im having trouble replicating as well. The hand is pretty slopey and pinchy, so it's not a jug to jump to (at least not for me). Toe hook on the volume (cut off by my video unfortunately), slap onto the triangle volume, match the slopey hand hold (could also not worry about the match, and keep my hand on the triangle volume). Adjusted hands like crazy hoping for better purchase (which i need to work on eliminating), dropped the left foot to try for a better body position, and went with the right hand. Next time I try this (After my shoulder feels less wrecked) I will try with the left hand and focus on using my heel to elevated my body a bit more towards the hold (maybe use the side of my heel and engage with my hamstrings to bring body higher?) Might also keep the toe hook on. Probably have tried this problem around 8 times, all in one session, before stopping due to shoulder pain.

4. [Too Much on my Mind Kilter v5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAL1e1LGS7Q): This was a flash. Only thing I noticed was when trying to match the final hold, I had my right foot swing out when I raised my left foot. I'm not sure why this happened. My best guess is that I need to push harder with my foot and tension my core more.

5. [Pitseleh kilter v5:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOwiz8ZUpY) This went down pretty fast as well, maybe 3 tries. The first move was the only move that really gave me trouble. My body still seemed kinda shakey after hitting that hold, while good climbers seem to hit the hold and then stay completely still. My guess is that I need better timing with my tension after hitting the hold. Tense my core, legs, everything. Struggled to place my foot at 15 seconds because my accuracy is trash. Need more deliberate practice during warm ups.

6. [Romeo Kilter v5:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoXOAbNBzZ8) This went in around 4 tries. First move was also the move that gave me issues. I think I have a hard time engaging my quads/hamstrings when the foot hold is high, even though my flexibility to reach those holds seems fine normally. When I go for the move at 7 seconds, my body sags away pretty badly when I hit it. This is a tension issue again I'm assuming.

7. [Mike's Harder Lemonade v5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV9ljwBnaJs): This was the hardest of the 4, took around 8 tries and 2 sessions for this. For some reason, I was fixated on skipping the second move and going straight up to the one above it, since I struggled with holding onto the hold the first time I tried it. In retrospect, that was a waste of time and pretty silly, I should have just tried that beta again without giving up after one or two tries, and skipping a hold probably wasn't making things easier. The move at 8 seconds gave me a bit of trouble. I'm not sure I have the correct body position for the move, as I swung out when I made it. Perhaps I needed to dangle my foot more directly underneath myself, or pressed my toe against the wall. Not sure which way is the right way forwards. The rest of the problem wasnt too hard for me. The finishing dyno I think I landed without too much excessive swing, but it was a small jump, so controlling my swing wasn't too hard.

Seeing as all these kilter v5s were relatively easy for me I should probably be projecting some Kilter 40 degree v7s.

My big takeaways:

1. Work on footwork: accuracy, foot bobbing, and keeping pressure on the foothold while going through the move
2. Tension needs work! My body sags away a ton on tension moves. Maybe practice rooting? This might tie to keeping pressure on the foothold while doing the move
3. Need to work on route reading, intuition, and projecting
4. Need to bullet proof my shoulders more. Also need to work on controlling my body when doing dynos.
5. Learn to engage my hips and hamstrings more when using high feet

Thanks again for all your help!

EDIT: Also, does anyone have any tips for controlling the body while dynoing?

Shauna Coxsey's 'Core for climbers' videos I just rediscovered the following videos by Shauna Coxsey, and did not find them in older posts, so posting them here in order to ask what you think:

- [Mobility warmups for climbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il_fa8DQ0R4)
- [Core for climbers, part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbULcctnsPY)
- [Core for climbers, part 2 - planks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1NTRhA2pp4)

Doing the warmup + both series of exercises took me 30 minutes, and was challenging enough for me (v1 in all gyms), even without additional weights.
How do you deal with the effects climbing has on your skin? Initially I couldn't do enough climbing to feel any of this effect, but I've recently tried to increase how much volume of climbing I do in a session. I'm now getting sensitive finger skin toward the end of the workout, which leads me to stop earlier than I want to. I can still feel it the next day. If I look closely at my fingertip it looks like the fingerprint is gone and instead it has a smooth and polished surface.

So here's a few questions regarding the topic:

* Is this a trainable thing in that skin automatically gets tougher to deal with more climbing?
* How does climbing style or the type of climbing affect this skin abrasion effect, and what can be done to reduce it?
* What can I do as supplemental training if I still have energy and strength left, but the finger skin hurts too much to continue doing boulders or routes?
I've just become a grade-chaser and I'm not really having fun climbing anymore. Bit of a rant, but I've been getting frustrated with climbing lately. I can't seem to relax and do it just for the fun of doing it, it's just become another area in my life in which I can beat myself up for not being better. I've been climbing consistently for 2 years, I'm hovering around the V4 / 5.10 level indoors and 5.8 outdoors. I genuinely like climbing but more often than not I've become obsessed with constantly improving and being really hard on myself for not being a better climber. I know my expectations are probably unrealistic, and that every day in the gym is not necessarily going to be my best day.

&amp;#x200B;

But I can't get out of my head about it. Every time I go to the gym or crag I find a new way to beat myself up mentally to the point where I almost dread climbing because of the intense pressure I put upon myself when I do it. This makes me sad because I started climbing consistently when I got sober and it was a great release and way to exercise and really helped me get through early sobriety. It was fun. I just want to take the pressure of myself and be able to enjoy it again without worrying about grades or how I "should" be climbing at a higher level of what I am doing currently. I just can't seem to get out of my head about it.

I'm sure a lot of you have experience with this, how were you able to take the pressure of a bit and re-learn to just enjoy climbing for the sake of enjoying it?
I want to start climbing but I feel so embarrassed Sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this but I didn’t know where else to go.

I went to a gym for the first time on my own today because I’ve wanted to start climbing for a long time. When I got there though I just felt so out of place. I feel like everyone was staring at me while belaying. A few people even tried to help me which was kind of them and I know they were just trying to help but it made me feel stupid when I was struggling to put the harness on. Can anyone help me where to start? I feel so lost and unmotivated after today

EDIT: Thanks for all the awesome replies, I can already tell that climbing is an awesome and supportive community. This thread has made me a lot more confident already
Cold fingers while climbing I always get cold fingers, even if it's not really cold (around 15C, 59 F).
Warming up before doesn't help. My fingers get cold while climbing.
I only get warm fingers afterwards, or in Routers with a proper rest in the middle, where I can shake around  3-5 min and put my fingers on my neck.

Any tips? Does someone have experience with "vertic sleeves"?
Keep going! Here on the sub there are a lot of psyched people that really want to improve. It's easy to bother yourself with science behind training and that's good but often times i like a lot of people here forget about the core principles. Hard work is the key. Everyone has bad days even Ondra, even Megos, even you and you should embrace that. Pleatues are inevitable and we should embrace that. Just keep going even if you don't see the results, eventually you will. 

Climbing for me is a big part of my life, when things go well i feel good, when things go not so well i feel depressed. What really helps me is bringing back into my mind the reasons i do this, the reasons why i started climbing and why i love it so much. Even if there are a lot of people better than me, that flash my project that's okay, even though it can be depressing and a lot of people shy from this. They try to be happy for the person that did well, but let's be honest it doesn't feel so good when a 14 years old kid just warms up on your project haha.
Confirmed: V15 is possible at 190 lbs [https://www.instagram.com/p/CNdzcO5gcp5/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNdzcO5gcp5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

&amp;#x200B;

Not a training video, but with the ubiquity of posts about getting light to climb hard, I thought I'd post this here. This is uncut footage of Jon Glassberg cruising the Nest V15 at 6' 3" and 190 lbs. I think this is the first publicized example of someone over 180 lbs climbing V15, and it's exciting to see that it is possible. For those who are interested, he talked about the experience and training process on the nugget podcast, which has an 18 minute teaser of the interview available for free: [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/teaser-follow-up-jon-glassberg-sending-nest-representing/id1497082818?i=1000517218523](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/teaser-follow-up-jon-glassberg-sending-nest-representing/id1497082818?i=1000517218523). As a heavier climber, I found this really fun and motivating to listen to and hope you guys enjoy it too!

Edit: As a few people have pointed out, there are other climbers thought to be 190 lbs who have sent V14 or V15, such as Toni Lamprecht and Klem Loskot. I’ve highlighted Jon Glassberg because, as far as I know, he is the only example who has confirmed his weight (at least in English media).
Full Body Mobility routine for Climbers - great stretches and exercises to improve the wrists, shoulders, back, chest, hip and hamstring mobility
Gym-based exercises for improving climbing? Following ankle injuries, I'm looking to get strong and fit again, but won't be able to climbing on a wall for at least a couple of months. Can anyone recommend some exercises that can be done in a gym that will help with getting climbing fit again, please? I'm keen to lose a few lbs as well as strengthen the necessary climbing muscles, so any advice regarding volume and amount of weight would be really appreciated.
My half crimp and full crimp are weaker than my open hand. Is that a problem? I have been climbing for close to two years (3 times a week for one year) and have always just used open hand on crimps. It seems like most good climbers I see get more power from half crimp and full crimp.

Whenever I try hangboarding half crimp my pinky finger eventually gives up and turns it into open hand. And when I put my thumb over my index finger I feel like I'm going to break it. Right now I'm training my half crimp and full crimp by low intensity hangboarding.

I'm wondering if training half crimp and full crimp has worked for anyone? Or maybe open hand just fits the physiology of my hand better.
What kind Repeaters to do? I'm looking at the crimpd app and see multiple variations on 7:3 repeaters so I'm curious which workout people would most recommend:

**a.** 6reps x 10sets 1min rest (aerobic)

**b.** 6reps x 6sets 3mins (with added weight) (power endurance)

**c.** 12reps x 6sets 4mins (power endurance)

I'm mostly a boulderer (V9-10) and just did a phase of one-arm max hangs (24mm, -7kg, 10secs) and am looking for alternate finger training targeting hypertrophy. I'm guessing each workout depends on your goal but I'm curious on other peoples opinions on a repeater program that isn't just for conditioning beginners.

I have tried all of these workouts before but not long enough to form an opinion 

PS : I am looking to get back into sport climbing due to a recent meniscus repair
Making easy climbs feel easy I recently accomplished a long-term goal of sending 8b+ (yay). Now I'm turning back towards some long-route goals, and I'm running up against a long-term issue that I've never really been able to fix. 

In short, 7a-up still feels hard. I've never been able to onsight 7c, and anything 7b or higher feels super limit level to onsight. One onsight attempt of something of that grade will end my day, usually, and it's still rare to do more than one new 7th grade climb on a given day. Many friends I have that climb substantially lower redpoint grades are capable of doing many pitches in that range in a given day. What am I doing wrong? Is this just a volume issue?
Training your head game? Hey guys! I've been climbing for a little over two years now (4-5 times a week usually, save for the four month pause quarantine made me take), and I've been seeing a lot of improvements in my strength these past few weeks because I've been doing Alex Puccio's training app, but I'm having such a hard time applying it to my sport climbing. I get so scared on lead, I almost never flash anything. It is becoming increasingly obvious to me that what is holding me back the most is my lack of confidence and fear, especially when leading. Sport climbing is my preference, and I only started bouldering more recently to do the training app, and while I'm sending some boulders I'm proud of, I just haven't been able to do well in sport climbing. I'm seriously about to turn to witchcraft here or something, I just want to become brave and strong!! I'm getting so frustrated with myself, and it is making everything even worse. Has anybody been in a similar position? How did you get a better mindset?
Anyone else really struggle with heel hook strains? Hey all. I've been climbing for a while now and I project in the V8-V10 range, and I've noticed I really struggle with not getting some moderate injury whenever I heel hook on a hard climb. I stretch my hamstrings quite a bit, and at 140lbs I deadlift 315 so I don't think they're underdeveloped or weak. I was thinking once my most recent strain is healed of trying to incorporate nordic curls and squats more to train them in different ways, how has anyone else delt with this?
Tips on generating more force through the feet on overhangs with small crimps? I've been working on this V9/10 on a 30 degree or so overhang and I've got every move down except the crux and I just for the life of me cannot generate force off of the available foot.

Your left hand is a crimp side pull about neck height when you are already in place on the wall, the right hand is a better crimp at around my sternum and the intended foot is a pocket you jam your toe in that is maybe 3 feet below the right hand hold and a little more to the center, but still closer to the right then left hand. The hold I have to get to is a decent crimp about 4 feet above the right hand and faces up and to the right at about a 45 degree angle. For all the other moves it is easy to apply force through the feet, but this one move it is like my foot just sits there and generates no force and I don't know what to change. It isn't even that bad of a foothold.
My results from 30 days hangboard routine inspired by Emil Abrahamson Yes another post about trying Emil's routine. I know that there were some misleading parts in his video and the study he cited is perhaps not supporting his claims completely. But my takeaway is mainly that hangboarding every day at low intensity might be good.

Btw I have been climbing for a bit over a year and I felt like my fingerstrength was pretty much the same for the the 3 months before the experiment. My highest indoor bouldering grade is 7a and I can do about half of the 6c's at my gym. I climb 2-3 times a week and have not been hangboarding consistently before

###The routine

My routine changed from day to day but I think that is not very important. I did this routine one time a day on the days that I wasn't climbing. Essentially I pulled on my doorframe at 50%-80% (depending on the hold) for 10-30 sec and rested for 30-60 sec. I repeated that process for about 10-15 min.

###Results

I tested to see if my weighted maxhangs improved. I just used open hand

####Before

85.5 kg bodyweight

139% bodyweigh (33.75kg) on 20mm for 7 sec

26 sec on 14 mm 

####After 

85.5 kg

170% Bodyweight (60 kg) on 20 mm for 7 c

55 sec on 14 mm

###Conclusion

Holy heck that's a big improvement. I'm extremely happy, I would have been happy with 150% bodyweight on 20 mm. It hasn't translated into a big improvement in climbing ability though. That might be partly because I'm used to having a lower strength and therefore don't try moves that I might be able to do now. There was a boulder today where I on a whim tried to do a campus move on pretty bad crimps. I "felt" like it would never work but when I tried it was relatively easy. 

One problem with this test is that I didn't test the strength of my half crimp which might've been more reflective of how I usually climb. 

###In the future

I'm definetely going to be doing this more.

Listening to Dave Macleod among others I'm not as scared of hangboarding as I was. I'm pretty aware of when I'm getting close to a pulley injury or overtraining anyways. I'm planning on hangboarding almost every day at high intensity. If I start to get overtrained or feel any pain I'll just take a day off and lower the intensity. Maybe I'll make another post about that in the future.
What are you guys' other hobbies? Before you scream "REPOST!" in the comments, I have seen that one, but just wanted to get more updated answers, given the pandemic and everything. See here for the old one:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/c133li/other\_hobbies\_of\_climbing\_fanatics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/c133li/other_hobbies_of_climbing_fanatics/)

What are your other hobbies? It feels like climbing is just such a big part of my life that I feel lost when I'm not bouldering or not at the gym, training. I wish to look for something that I could do at anytime with the same drive / love that I have for climbing.

Right now? I video game when I'm free at night, plus some netflix of course. I might be looking into leather work soon.
Climbing Coach Online (open beta) Climbing Coach Online is a platform I have been working on for several years and is finally ready for open testing on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adamson.miles.climbing_coach_2). The testing be Android only since it's much easier on my end, but unlike my other apps this one will be available on iOS once it's released.

The platform hosts exercises, training programs, user profiles, photos and training tips. It will have a subscription pay model, but for testing all features will be available for free. It uses Google Sign In to authenticate its users. You will need to link a Gmail account to create a profile. Currently I have a subscription price set at $4.99 CAD / month, which is the same as Spotify for students.

# Exercises

The core feature is of course exercises. All users can create and search for exercises. Note that very few exist yet. Hopefully users will contribute a lot of good content over time. Exercises have a lot of information:

* Tags (strength, power, fitness, ect) 
* Equipment they require (free weights, lead/TR, ect)
* Difficulty
* Duration
* Instructions and task breakdown
* Partner requirement
* Photos
* Ratings/reviews

Most of this info you can search and filter by. This allows users to find exercises which suit their needs - if you have 15 minutes for a finger strength exercise and a hangboard available, just search for that and order them by "top rated". From there, you can view the exercise details and user the timer to walk you through the exercises tasks.

[Create exercises](https://reddit.com/link/myjr96/video/dulmfgceaev61/player)

# Stats and Analysis

Every time you complete an exercise (or mark it as completed) a logbook entry is saved for your profile. This saves what equipment you used, tags you training and everything else fundamental about the exercise. Subscribers will be able to view visuals to get insight into their training progress and habits. You can view a breakdown of a day (pie chart), a time range (bar graph) or the accumulation of training time (line graph). In your logbook, you can easily find any exercise you have done before.

[stats and plots](https://reddit.com/link/myjr96/video/aty4jefvbev61/player)

# Program Templates

Climbing Coach Online can create you a training program from a template. A template determines which exercises should be included in a program and when. This is done by designing phases. A phase is a section of a training program which has some purpose, perhaps it is for volume and endurance. Phases have a "weight" which determines their relative length to each other.

[Create program template](https://reddit.com/link/myjr96/video/iuxjmdbpbev61/player)

# Training Programs

Paid users can build a training program from any template. They will specify what difficulty of exercises to include, days of week to train, start date, duration and the equipment they have available. From the exercise database, Climbing Coach Online will pull exercises which meet those requirements. They will then be organized into a calendar full of exercises. Note that at the time of writing, there are very few exercises in the database and this feature will not work that well yet. There won't be enough exercises to create a flushed out program with a variety of exercises yet.

# Other Features

* Preferences 
   * Equipment you have available
   * Grade you climb
   * Favorite tag
* Leaderboard
   * Gain karma for creating and reviewing content
   * Gain karma when your own content is reviewed favorably
* Report system

* Attach videos to exercises
* Notifications, like when your exercise is favorited or reviewed 5 stars
Efficiency on chalkless onsights? I find vertical climbs with hidden / hard to spot holds that are chalkless very hard to onsight (7b). Even if I succeed, I dump huge amount of my energy on it. The reason that happens is by being overly static and slower which makes it possible for me to get to the right hold and stay on route. Being dynamic can save energy but for these type of routes what happens is deadpointing to the wrong hold which is a non-existent 4mm sloping edge that will spit me off at a minor body imbalance. 
 So how do I onsight such routes efficiently? I'd like to progress with this style. More experience would certainly help but some guidance, your experience and tips would be helpful I believe.
I can’t pinch I’ve been climbing for a little while (I project v8) and have recently realized that I can’t engage my thumbs at all. I feel like I get no pressure out for them even when I try to push to pinch. I’ve tried climbing easier pinch heavy routes but it doesn’t seem to help. Any suggestions? I feel like this one change would really improve my climbing, but so far I’ve had no luck.
Long Duration Fingerboard Repeaters I am following attempting the long duration fingerboard repeater workout from Training for Climbing by Horst, but even the simplest level is too hard for me. I am mainly a sport climber, roughly onsighting 6A. One of my biggest weaknesses is my resting ability, hence me chosing this workout. I have a knee injury that is preventing me from making too many miles on the wall, so therefore I am trying to supplement my training by hangboarding.

The workout is: 3 sets: 30s on 30s off.

 I have a pair of Metolius rock rings that I am using and I am currently grabbing the ring itself, but even then I am still not managing to complete 1 set. What can I do to make this lighter? Should I use a pulley mechanism to reduce the weight or should I decrease the hang to rest ratio(I'm afraid that this will skew the energy system I am training)?

An injury might be coming.. what next? I'm trying to heighten my awareness of an impending a2 finger pulley injury, given my history with them. Today I started my session and after my hangboard warm up, the fingers on my left hand felt tired. I decided to pull back on the board climbing and take it easier, but what's next? Long duration rest? Lower intensity for next week? 

Long time injury experts, let me know!

edit : meant hangboard warm up, not workout
3 finger drag preference over four finger open hand? Hey everyone! The last few questions I’ve asked here have been answer with some great advice so I’m back!

Last year I had a mild-moderate tear in my left hand lumbrical between my ring + pinky finger pulling on a slopey pocket at wild iris (lmao classic). After recovering, I decided to start training 3 finger drag/2 finger pocket grips via a variety of hangs (mostly repeaters + density). Climbing on limestone is my favorite, so I figured trying to bulletproof my hands to pocket strains wasn’t a bad idea.

It worked! My 3 finger drag got ALOT stronger, and I feel no tweakiness in both drag/2 finger positions. However, now when I am doing moves that require open hand grips,  I almost instinctually switch to a 3 finger drag on the hold. I feel way more solid in that grip position. Is this a problem i.e. is this predisposing me to injury? I see climbers like Anna Davey pretty much constantly switching to a drag as well. 

Problem? No Problem? Should I be training pinky on too?

Thank you in advance!

Active rest for tendon recovery: maybe you should stop climbing *TL;DR.* They say if you have tendon injury, keep climbing, but lightly. I found that didn’t work for me, and it was necessary to stop climbing completely and replace it with hangboard sessions and lockoff training + rehab for a few weeks. Then, I would slowly replace some hangboard sessions with climbing.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in December, I wrote an [informal guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/kh48mu/what_ive_learned_after_2_months_of_golfers_elbow/) to everything I had learned in the process of healing from golfer’s elbow. Soon after, like an idiot, I tried to do a one-arm lock-off, and suddenly I a new opportunity to learn about golfer’s elbow. Now, after 4 months of slow, uneven, miserable recovery — and many mistakes — I have one other insight I wanted to share: the idea that maybe you really should stop climbing and instead take an “active rest,” that is, training without climbing.

\*Note: I am not a professional, and it is best to consult one for your own needs and to set a rehab program that is best for you.

I mentioned in my original post that most experts recommend that you keep climbing. They say tendons hate two things: change and rest. Tendons won’t heal unless they’re stimulated by being used. So, if you stop climbing for a few months, they’ll feel better, but once you start climbing again, you’ll have the same problem. All this is probably true.

And yet, I found that personally, I couldn’t recover if I kept climbing through the worst periods of my injury. Perhaps other climbers have the self-control to climb without overdoing it but I couldn’t seem to get it right. It’s hard not to screw up, because usually you can’t feel the problem in the moment — and anyways, it’s supposed to hurt slightly, so the signal from the body is extremely ambiguous.

Instead, I found I recovered most rapidly in periods when I would stop climbing completely, but without resting completely either. Rather, I would do light training, meaning rehab exercises daily + light hangboard and lockoff training every second day. I first discovered that this seemed to work because of a COVID lockdown. Later, when I was making no progress whatsoever — a miserable feeling — I found I could only get out of the rut if I took 2-3 weeks off with this kind of active rest.

I found a very helpful [guide to tendon recovery](https://orthosports.com.au/pdf-download/Understanding-tendon-rehabilitation-Paul-Mason.pdf) that contains this useful diagram below, which helps to express the goal: push hard enough for strength, but no so hard as to reinjure. This kind of control, I think, is simply easier to achieve on a hangboard than at a climbing gym — with all those tempting problems, and the risk of even doing one stupid move that will push it too far.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o3svrn966lw61.jpg?width=1090&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e23b8feaefb4c5edf411183080d4838448d51281

So here’s the approach I used to finally, finally recover:

* **Phase 1. Active rest during the worst of the injury.** For me this meant that I could “feel” the tendon when I picked up a glass or while doing nothing, the tendon itself felt taut like a cable, the connective bone was sensitive to the touch, and/or pushing against the nose caused the tendon to hurt (not always true).
   * **Duration.** 2-3 weeks, or when it starts to feel better.
   * **Climbing.** None.
   * **Rehab everyday.** Don’t push too hard. The diagram is helpful in indicating that you want to stimulate it, but stop in the early part of the graph. (Doing more, I found, made my arm feel worse the next day if I did hangboarding or climbing). Consider instead doing exercises multiple times a day (i.e., the [6 hour method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBTI9qiH4UE&amp;t=1s)). Note that there are experts who would tell you to push harder and so this is my non-expert opinion.
   * **Hangboard every 2nd day and sometimes take an extra rest day.** At first, I did 60% of my usual session, with fewer reps and fewer sets. This regrettably caused a big decline in my strength that hopefully you can avoid by doing this early and decisively, rather than letting it drag on for months. I did density-style hang boarding: two sets of eight 15-20 second long hangs. (I've since fully recovered my strength).
   * **Lockoffs.** These are a great way to both stimulate your tendons and keep your arms from becoming too weak. I was doing them daily (3 sets of 30 seconds), but found this to be too much. Consider either lighter sets daily or 30 second sets on hangboard days. Also, do lots of push ups.
* **Phase 2. Progressive Reloading.** A few weeks of the above reliably gave me major progress. Then I would start climbing again, and it’s important to do this very carefully, because God it is so easy to set yourself back. I found what seemed to work is the following:
   * Climb day.
   * Rest day.
   * Hanboard day.
   * Rest day.
   * Climb day.
   * Rest day.
   * Total rest day: no or very little rehab.
   * Hangboard day.
   * And so on.
* Then, slowly, I started replacing some of those hangboard days with more climbing sessions. On hangboard days, consider progressing beyond static exercises to stuff that will prepare your arm for pulling, like light bicep curls, pull ups, etc. Don’t overdo it.
* **When you screw up, take short active breaks.** While I was recovering, I would incessantly screw up and climb too hard. Two hangboard days plus rest days in between seemed to get me back on track.
* **Phase 3. Climb Sleepwalker.**

I really, really, really hope this works for other people, because tendon injury is deeply dispiriting. I’m happy to say that yesterday I just sent the project I was working on back in November, before I hurt myself. It’s a wonderful feeling. Climbing is such a source of joy. I am so grateful to again have the opportunity to push hard.
Slopers for Woody Edit: Does anybody have experience with the Atomik XL Font Pinches (Neutral or Slopey), or with the Atomik XL Font Slopers (Set #1 or #2)?

I've got a home woody that is at 40degrees. It's mostly edges and small crimps right now, which I really like for training. But I'd like to add some slopers so it's not fingery 100% of the time.

I am attracted to the 'ball' shapes because they could be used from multiple angles. However, I would like to avoid holds where the best grip position ends up being a 'meat hook' or sloth-like grip. I don't find that kind of grip often outdoors, so I'd like to avoid it for training on my home wall.

As for difficulty, I'm looking for V6-V9 difficulty at my 40degrees from these holds. I climb V10 outdoors, but more of my limit-bouldering sessions on this woody will probably still revolve around the crimps/edges. I don't want these to be jugs, but I also don't want them to be limit just to hang at all; I want to be doing shouldery moves off of them.

Right now I'm looking at Teknik holds. The "Short Round Slopers" look like they might be too shallow, but the "Round Slopers" look like they might have the issue above of a sloth-grip being the best way to grab them. I'm based in the US, if that makes a difference for hold recommendations.

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

Existing holds on the woody:

\-The large red holds are the "Fatty Fat Pinches" from Teknik. I actually don't like them very much, because they are too big. I can't put them in the middle of the wall or they would block too many holds, and they end up being too juggy.

\-The longer blue holds are the Teknik "Grand High Scarabs", which they sent me by mistake so I got to keep. They are slopey, but only about 1-1.5pad deep, so it's more like a slopey half crimp rather than a more open handed grip.

\-The edges and cirmps I like are the Teknik Scarabs (purple), e-grips buttons (green), Teknik Crickets (green), e-grips peabody crimps (blue), kilter Winter XS 1 Steep Feet (yellow), e-grips comfy crimps (orange). 

\-The purple pinches are Decoy Holds minimalist beak pinches, which are awesome. The blue pinches are the e-grips Myorcan Mini water Tufas, which are also pretty good.

\-The ceramic mini jugs are from Synrock, mostly pretty good but wish a lot of them were better shapes.

\-Screw in feet are Metolius greatest chips (hands)

First, if you filled it out and you haven't heard anything yet, then a) check your spam folder and b) I'm getting there, I swear. Since this is free and I'm trying to keep all the responses tailored to each person, it's taking a while.

Second, it's taking a while because there were hundreds of responses! They varied in climbing age from a month to 40 years, in performance level from 5.8 to 5.14+/V13 and in almost every conceivable morphology and demographic. People who could do a pullup with 170% bodyweight to no pullups at all. Some submissions climb only outside and live in a van, and others had never climbed outside before at all. Climbers who had no training history whatsoever doing V8 benchmarks on the Moonboard, and 400+lb deadlift monsters climbing the same level.

It's actually a really interesting cross-section of this community. I didn't really know what to expect, and I know climbing is an insanely asymmetrical and peculiar sport. I was still blown away by how wildly varying everyone's climbing is and how interesting it is to learn how different people perceive it.

Third, generally people seemed to find the survey itself useful, which was something I hoped for. I really take a holistic and not purely strength-based view of climbing, and this survey is an attempt represent that complex view of a climber's performance.

I have a few major takeaways now that I'm about halfway through the assessments. I find myself giving the same advice to a lot of people, which is something also seen a lot on this forum to the same questions. I want to turn this into something useful, like a pay-what-you-can training plan, since a lot of the people who participated are students or otherwise unable to "officially" train with a coach. But in the meantime I just wanted to make a follow up post to say thanks, and to let anyone who hasn't heard from me know that I'm going as fast as I can :)

**EDIT:** I am going to turn the form off today around 2PT. Posting this follow-up sort of reignited the form submissions which doesn't help my backlog. I will do my best to get to everyone who's submitted but it may take weeks or months. However, I plan to turn what I've learned here into a pay-what-you-can plan so that anyone can assess themselves and participate. Thanks everyone!
Been feeling out of shape on the wall, not sure what to work on. Looking for guidance Recently I've been feeling heavier and slower on the wall. Feeling a lack of tension. An overall regression in general abilities. I'm not exactly sure what I need to get back to feeling light, strong, and fit on the wall. 

I climb 3 times a week, usually. I do minimal exercise on my off days. Thinking I need to do more, but not sure what to do.

Any advice?
People who work business hours, do you do gym then dinner, or dinner then gym. I work 7-4 most days.  Would it make more sense to eat before or after a gym session?
Is training a one-way street? I'm slowly and grudgingly moving into training from just climbing for the last year or so. I'd dabbled with training before but found I didn't need it, and compared to just climbing I don't like it as much. Now that I'm around v6/7 indoors and getting into 11+ sport outdoors I'm finding a few things that seem to be telling me it's time to start training.
Injuries (mostly nuisance tweaks so far), moves (especially indoors) where my body just doesn't feel strong enough to do without risking injury, and finger strength outdoors. I feel my technique is a strong suit. For reference I'm 6'/165lbs, I bench around 140, deadlift about 185, max 5s hang is around 200lb total, 215 max pull up. 

My question is whether anyone here has a perspective on going into training and coming out to return to just climbing? What was the time commitment and what did you learn?

Edit: thanks a lot for great input from everyone. I feel I have the input I want to handle my specific issues from this. A few people asked about the title and so let me add my response to maestroest here to clarify why I asked "is training a 1-way street?":

I think the "listen to your body" part of climbing is super important if you're just climbing. Seems like training is designed to proof you from some of those issues. But then if you cut the training, now you've conditioned yourself to push through a comfort level and rely on your strength as opposed to listen, and you are deconditioning gradually. It seems this would make you prone to injury when you try to return to just climbing. That's really my conundrum and why I'm very hesitant to get into dedicated training.
... And more generally, when you cut training certain strength systems will deteriorate leading to worse climbing or injury. So once you start, you're locked into it? What's your opinion of/experience with that philosophical problem?
If you have big boobs is it harder to climb? I have pretty big boobs and am a little bit on the currier side.  I was wondering if this is going to hinder my climbing.  I've only been climbing for 3 months and have made some progress but it might be harder for me to get to higher levels of bouldering?
I find it really difficult to try hard I've been climbing for four years now and have kinda plateaued around V7/8 and 5.12-. I'm a boulderer by far so my route plateau is more due to endurance and just not feeling natural on a rope - more exposure will improve that. But bouldering, I can do the moves on v10/11 but when it comes to actually trying to send from the ground I honestly feel like I'm giving 50% effort max. Like I can boulder all day, multiple days in a row, working v10 and not be tired. And I think it's cause I'm not trying very hard.

This obviously has contributed to my plateau and I am feeling kinda bad about it because I haven't actually sent anything hard outside in like a year. Some people have commented that my goals for this year aren't realistic (v10 and 12d) despite the fact that I can always do the hardest moves on these climbs and do each move, it's just finding the desire to actually link it. When I'm on a trip, that desire is there. But at home, having access to it, my attitude has been so non-committal to finishing boulders and routes. I just can't try hard, and when I want to try hard I don't think I am. I don't know how to. 

How the hell do you actually try hard because I'm kind of sick of just failing and not sending and I'm fine to go out and do solo sessions and work easy shit if it means I'll learn to turn it up.
Where to start: Improving pull-up strength/power as a less explosive climber This is a question for my gf... trying to help her improve but not sure where to start cause my baseline strength was way different. Coming into the sport as an active male where lifting weights was the norm in high school and developmental years, I could always do 15 or more pull-ups. Knowing the basics of building strength, it was easy to figure out I just needed to add a lot of weight to keep my reps in the 4-6 range for a few sets to gain more pull power, then transition into one arms. Now, my girlfriend/climbing partner is at a level with bouldering where she’s getting into the V6 zone and is really technical and has crazy strong fingers... but outside it’s blowing my mind how many boulders V5 and up just require way more pull power than I ever realized. She can run laps on crimpy V3s, non-powerful and techy 4s, and crimpy 5s and 6s take just a couple sessions... but she’s hitting this huge wall above that. Good news is it’s so easy/quick to develop that muscular strength compared to finger/tendon strength... bad news is I don’t know how to structure it for her. She can do 4 pull-ups in a row... what do you do with that number to develop strength/power? 4 sets of 2-3? Use a pulley system to remove weight so you can do 4 sets of 4-6 and then progressively remove weight as that gets easier? Any other recommended workouts to get that power/explosiveness? Any and all advice appreciated!
Good power, good finger strength, but i can't use both together? I've been hanging around V8/V9 projecting for a while now, and I noticed something I thought was odd in my training. I do well on lattice max hangs, one arm for 7seconds on a stronger day, and I have good lat strength/power, but I can't seem to translate it to either the campus board or real climbs. For example I can come very close to 1-5-9 on jugs, but haven't even hit 1-4-7 on the bigger-crimps(like 25mm I think?), And just barely 1-4-6 the 20mm. I also feel like I can only do crimpy moves either super statically, or on really positive overhangs. Any move that requires quickly throwing to a crimp and keeping everything on the wall feels Impossible. Maybe this is too specific, but I'm wondering if anyone has any training or technique tips for this type of weakness.
Requesting feedback on my summer training plan Recently, I've really tried hard to learn more about climbing - what makes it hard, my own strengths and weaknesses, and how to improve it. I've really enjoyed being part of this community throughout that time as well, as you all have been an incredible resource, both with posting comments/questions and with reading archived posts from years back.

**My background**: Climbing just over 4 years now, going to the gym 3x per week very consistently. Climbing 11c/d on sport (RP outdoor grades), slightly higher in the gym. Climbing V5 consistently (V6 x3) RP indoor bouldering (no outdoor near me). This has remained static for about a year of consistent weekly climbing. Primarily a sport climber, bouldering is more of a training tool for me.

A recent post I made talks about my climbing plateau ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/motd16/just_climbing_to_improve_a_sound_strategy_but_how/)). In the last 6 months I've spent most of my time projecting indoor sport at my limit and really not seeing much progress. In hindsight, I realize my mistake. I spent too much time working in the Anaerobic Lactic energy zone as a result of my constant projecting, stringing together hard moves at lower volume (ie, too much power endurance). Over time, I believe my work capacity decreased significantly as I usually never did more than 3 or 4 indoor leads per workout, or &lt;10 per week (wall height of about 35 feet). Some of the feedback from that post was telling me to incorporate more volume training and back off the lead projecting a good amount, so I've taken that into consideration and tried to draw up a climbing-only focused approach to getting better.

So here it is. I wanted something that was Non-Linear but not totally a strict periodization like what the Anderson Bros talk about, so while I do have "phases" I'm still climbing throughout. Most of this is inspired by a few posts I've read on the climb strong blog ([like this](https://www.climbstrong.com/education-center/endurance-3-0/)). So In each phase I want to have a focus for improvement but still work a bit of everything so as not to lose power or strength in the endurance phase, for example. by the way, this is just the climbing, I have minimal off the wall accessory work that I won't include here because it's not that relevant.

My 14-week plan with 3 macro-cycles in this order:

***Phase 1: Base Building*** \- Strength &amp; Volume (Anaerobic Alactic + Aerobic) - 6 weeks. Week 6 is Deload. Inspired by the [High-Low](https://www.climbstrong.com/education-center/high-low-training-what-to-do-and-when/) Strategy but not strictly that. My goal is to increase work capacity &amp; finger strength.

* Day 1: Tension Board &amp; ARC
   * Easy boulder warmup, work up to flash level
   * *60 mins* Tension Board projecting (work up to 1 hour sessions). Pure finger strength.
   * *30 mins* Single Session Sends in the bouldering gym &amp; perfect repeats (V3-4 problems when I'm tired). Continue to enforce good technique when I'm too weak to power through cruxes.
   * *30 mins* \- Board ARC - Vertical, easy climbing. Work up from 3 sets at 10 minutes to 1 set at \~30 minutes or more. Just get volume, keep pump to a minimum
* Day 3: Endurance on a Rope
   * Warmup x1-2
   * Flash Level x1
   * RP level (11c-d) x1-2
   * Moderate (10b-d) Up-Down-Up on Vert Lead x2 &gt; work up from 1 Up-Down-Up project per session (90 feet of climbing) to 3 or 4 (120-150 feet of climbing). Keep grade consistent.
* Day 5: Tension Board &amp; ARC
   * Same as Day 1 workout
* Day 2, 4, 6, 7 - Rest. Day 2 and 4 is total and complete rest, Day 6 or 7 can be active rest, like Biking, Hiking, etc

&amp;#x200B;

***Phase 2 Route Endurance*** \- Endurance/Volume (Focusing on Aerobic but all systems are trained here) - 4 weeks (Week 4 is Deload). I'm cutting down some of the volume but raising the average intensity.

* Day 1: Bouldering
   * Easy boulder warmup, work up to flash level
   * *30 mins* Tension Board Single Session Sends. Maintain finger strength
   * *60 mins* Boulder projecting. Learn to work complex beta &amp; apply strength
   * *30 mins* \- Anaerobic Capacity Circuit
      * From the Crimpd App - 1 minute on / 1 minute off x10. I'll figure out the correct wall angle and create a circuit where I can do the first 6 minutes or so without being pumped, then start to get tired around the 9th minute on. I want to either fail on the last one OR barely succeed in getting all 10.
* Day 3: Lead Project
   * Warmup x1-2
   * Flash level x1
   * Project level (12a+) x2 same route
   * Cool down x1
* Day 5: Endurance on a Rope - Same as Phase 1 Endurance Day. Here I want to see progress in my Up-Down-Up project grade. If I was doing a 10a/b up-down-up x3 before, I'll push it up to 10c/d and try to work up to x3 on that.
* Day 2, 4, 6, 7 - Rest

&amp;#x200B;

***Phase 3: Route Power Endurance*** \- Power Endurance (Anaerobic Lactic Primarily) - 3 weeks. Deload for 1 week after

* Day 1: Bouldering
   * Easy boulder warmup, work up to flash level
   * *30 mins* Tension Board Single Session Sends. Maintain finger strength
   * *60 mins* Boulder projecting. Learn to work complex beta &amp; apply strength properly
   * *30 mins* \- Power Endurance Pump Circuit
      * Juggy 20-move Circuit at 20-25 deg, stay on the board for as long as possible. Record my time. Over the next 3 weeks, I want to see this time on the board move up, ideally to where I'm doing 5+ minutes on a pretty steep overhang.
* Day 3: Lead Project, same as Phase 2. Here the focus shifts to making big links on the routes I was projecting in the last phase. The bigger the links the better. I'm gonna get real pumped doing this.
* Day 5: Power Endurance on a rope
   * Warmup x1-2
   * Flash Level x1
   * RP level (11c-d) x1-2
   * Up-Down-Up Steep Lead x2-3 - so instead of vertical or near-vertical up-down-up projects in the last phase, I'm now doing steep up-down-up, which has ALWAYS been a weakness for me. The goal of this is to get silly pumped and fall off near the top of the last Up. Start at x1 and work up to x2-3

So seeing this, what kinds of adaptations do you think I can expect from this plan? Do you think it adheres to the goals that I've set? What would you do differently? Have you ever tried anything like this? I'm curious as to what people think about combining the Tension Board &amp; ARC into a single day. To me it makes sense as these are on the opposite end of the energy spectrum, and I'm wondering if it will work as expected since I've really not spent much time on the Tension Board. But wanted to try it instead of hang boarding for fingers because it seems more interesting.

EDIT: Thanks for all of the input. I've added a few minor changes based on feedback.

In a few months, when this is all over, I'll make a follow-up post detailing what happened, how it went, and the ultimate results. Thanks All.
How do you structure your training when climbing days depends on weather? Im really hoping to reach some climbing goals this year and want to work hard. I mainly sport climb outside. In the winter/when gyms were open it was easy to follow a plan that balanced strength training, hangboarding and actual climbing. I do well with a schedule so Id like to keep that up, but im finding it difficult to work around my erratic climbing schedule that is dependant on weather. Specifically, not sure what to do on weekdays where if I climb after work, I definitely don't have time to include any supplementary training as I drive to the crag as soon as my workday is done. Any advice or personal experience greatly appreciated!
What are the best 'no equipment required' core exercises for roof/incline climbing? Roof climbs are currently my weakness, largely because I suspect my core is weak and unable to maintain tension to transfer weight to my feet.

What are some exercises I can do from home with no equipment and using bodyweight to specifically improve this body tension? I do general core routines but am skeptical about how applicable to the specific muscles used in roof climbing.
Getting to that dialled confidence &amp; smoothness sooner So, I love that feeling of when you've got what used to be a difficult, strenuous, clunky feeling boulder dialled and everything feels smooth and efficient. 

Was just wondering if anyone had any tips on getting to that point sooner? I find that on the first few burns on a boulder I'm not confident with relying on certain holds, and I may even be hitting them the way that I do on more dialled burns. I find I just need to take a few falls in each position to be comfortable and smooth relying on more marginal holds, but does anyone have any tips on how to get to that point more quickly? especially in the realm of onsight/minimal attempts climbing. And, besides "try to onsight more".
solo vs. group bouldering motivation I used to pretty much boulder completely by myself. I have a block of time in the middle of the day to spend at the gym so it's usually pretty quiet. I've basically had the same sort of schedule for the 3 years ive been climbing. Managed to get into projecting v5 and v6, flashing or second time go most v4, climbing by myself.

 I ended up meeting some cool peeps at the gym, and we'd always be there at the same time so a natural group was formed and we banged out regular sessions. I found that I could send things way more often / be way more psyched to work harder problems and hard moves while climbing with them, ended up sending a v7. They were into the van life thing though, and they picked up and headed down the road so I'm back to climbing alone. 

Now I have like zero psych and anytime I get on hard stuff I just don't have that same focus and motivation.

Has anyone else been through anything like this? Is there anything you do to get psyched to do harder things when climbing solo?
Top Rope Solo Endurance Training I just recently started top rope soloing since my friend and I have different work schedules and when we finally do climb together we like to project routes. I’m currently projecting a 5.12a which I’ve done all the moves on, I just need to connect two parts since my endurance is trash.

If anyone here does top rope soloing I’m interested in hearing how you structure that session. I currently just do a climb around a full difficulty beneath my ability mostly because it’s a long climb so it gives me the most time on the wall and the most repetitions. I take a 5 minute break after each send and then climb again until I’m pumped and can’t do the route without coming off a couple times. Is there a better and more efficient method of training my endurance?
New Ideas to... you guessed it... Climb Harder I'm looking for some new ideas to switch up my training. Dave Macleod's 8b to 9a video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCIyoS10s3g) has me inspired to try something new. I'm basically the opposite of what he describes as his story in the video. I'm 14 years into climbing and for the last 10 years or so I've had a traditional 9-5+ M-F which has resulted in me getting pretty good at finger strength and power. For the first 4 years or so, I was pretty into RCTM Anderson Bros protocol. For the more recent 4 years and change, I've been more moon board and outdoor focused climbing as I live in Denver and can get out a good bit (80-100 days/yr). I'm 2-3 years plateaued at low ends of V11/5.14a (8a/8b+). My strength profile when healthy is 1.2 or 1.3X bodyweight on 1 arm 20mm edge and can campus 1-5-8.5 on a good day. Here are some areas I can identify that are weaknesses: (1) I feel most held back by nagging injuries like dip synovitis, elbow issues, carpal tunnel and some nerve issues that root from my shoulder/posture. I'm in my early 30's so this seems par for the course for this level of climbing and I spend about as much time rehabbing as I do training but maybe I should be doing something different.  (2) Another area is mobility. I grew up a runner and multi-sport athlete which has resulted in stiff hamstrings, low back, and generally poor mobility. So it's an area I'm considering shifting my focus to. (3) Then finally there's what Dave mentions in his video which is technique/climbing more... I've considered abandoning training and just climbing which would probably be easier on my joints and help me refine technique but I'm hesitant to fully give up some training since being able to apply power seems to correlate with training like campusing.   


Well, hopefully, this gives you an idea of where I'm at and maybe some of you have broken out of similar plateaus and can help me come up with some new ideas. Thanks for reading and look forward to hearing some new ideas.
What climbing tactics do you think will be commonplace in 5-10 years? It seems like the portable fan has seen a massive surge in popularity as the stigma of being 'that guy with the fan' at the crag has declined following their use by prominent pro climbers. What other tactics (whether you use them or not) do you think will be commonplace 10 years from now?  My bets: 1) other hand cooling tactics/devices (eg: bringing a hydroflask of ice water to pour on your hands between attempts) 2) a greater obsession with fingernail length/shape (generally trending toward a bit longer/flatter).
How to get over the fear of leading? I just got lead certified at my climbing gym, and have recently been leading a few routes each time I go climbing to try and get more comfortable with it. I was doing mostly bouldering and top-roping  up until a few weeks ago. When I was younger (in my teenage years), I ran out a quickdraw or two leading indoors and ended up decking. It was completely my fault, my belayer did his best to take up slack and luckily broke my fall enough to prevent any serious injury. Soon after that happened I took a hiatus from climbing, and just got back into it a year ago. Now that Im leading again I cant get over the fear of falling. I even ended up down-climbing a route the other day to prevent falling when I was having trouble clipping. I wasn't worried about falling at all until I started getting back into lead, now its at the forefront of my mind each time I get on the wall. Any tips on how to get over it? I've only taken a handful of falls since getting certified, they have yet to help boost my confidence.
What is a "technical" problem/route? How to get better at it? Our gym started using this app that shows all the boulder problems in the gym, along with tags that describe the problem, e.g., "powerful", "crimpy".  I noticed that the problems I struggled on the most have the tag "technical/delicate".  I've heard the term "technical" before but never really knew what it meant.  FWIW, the problems were generally on slight overhang.  I felt so weak on these problems.  They were smaller moves with slopey crimps and not-good feet.  I've only climbed outdoors twice and it felt similar.  


One thing that stood out was that most problems that I gravitate towards are powerful.  Once you latch the next hold, it feels pretty good so you can kind of quickly prep for the next move.  On these technical problems, the difficulty felt more sustained, i.e., once I latch onto the hold, it feels hard to stay on and move to the next hold.
Running weightlifting periodization for hangboarding I started hangboarding around 6 months ago and have seen huge improvements in terms of numbers but not a huge increase in climbing ability before lockdown. I've kept up with the hangboarding while shifting my focus to technique to address this. In lockdown though I figure it's best to keep on trying to get strength gains, the quote "there's no such thing as too much power" comes to mind. I hit a plateau in 10s max weight hangs a couple months ago and I broke it by shifting to 7s hangs. I've hit another plateau at 40kg, and I was thinking about trying some sort of periodization/variation in hangs rather than just adding 1kg each session.

I was thinking of running a concurrent variation of Eva Lopez's programs, my version would be 4 weeks MAW with 3 min edge sessions followed by 3 weeks MIN edge with 3 MAW sessions. This got me thinking about applying weightlifting periodization to hang-boarding. I'm really curious as to future hangboarding research and program development. Which programs have people had the most success with? Steve bechtel?

Edit:  I'm curious in particular how more improvements could be made by oscillating intensity and volume throughout the week, for example having one session of 7sx5 hangs and then another of 10sx10 hangs but at 10% lower intensity. What if we did 4 week blocks of hangboarding, with 3 weeks of ramping up intensity and decreasing volume followed by a deload?
V8+ climbers who have struggled with a weakness in technique, what specific changes did you make to improve? I've been projecting in the V8/9 range for a while now, and I have a pretty big discrepancy between climbs  with delicate footwork/beta, vs climbs you just need big arms and basic technique for. My strength benchmarks are higher then my grade by around 3 grades, and outside of mobility (I'm working on it!) I know footwork is my big weakness. 

But what specific strategies to improve that? I do some drills that I think should help a bit, like 8 flash grades In 8 minutes to force myself to be efficient. But all I find is that makes me dial in that specific climb's beta.
Beta for solo outdoor bouldering Hi guys and gals,

Since there seem to be many boulderers here, what are your tricks and tips for bouldering outside without spotters and with only one pad\* (plus a starter pad). Also how do you pace yourself between attempts, in particular when you try a new boulder problem to which you don't know the beta.

I've been on maybe 5 outside bouldering sessions in my life with others but at the moment I found a convenient project for when I don't find a partner or I'm short on time.

\*All my local climbing friends are also sport climbers so borrowing a pad is not straight-forward. It would be feasible for when I feel close sending, though.
Cure for "Elvis Leg"? Howdy folks. Just want to pass on a tip I read a while back that I've seen results from. It may have even come from this sub.

I used to get shaky legs while climbing but I always figured it was from nerves (I still suspect nerves play a role). The tip was to do calf raises while you brush your teeth. Just stand up straight, don't "lock" the knees, and move to your tippy toes in a controlled manner and then back down.

I started off doing about 40 in a row. Now I can easily bust out 100. So I switched to doing one-legged calf raises and I'm back to about 40 of those. Now I don't have shaky legs when I climb.

I don't know for certain if it was from the calf raises but I do have more endurance edging on technical routes. I also have more confidence just from gaining experience and getting comfortable on the sharp end, so I probably have less nerves too.

Anyway, just thought I'd share. Cheers.
This new training app makes you a fully custom climbing training plan, specific to your weaknesses Hello everybody! After a full year of research, user testing, development, and hours upon hours of full-time work, my team and I built **Send Story Training, a mobile app that builds you an entirely personalized training plan** from the ground up.

Here’s the sign up link to free early access: [https://sendstorytraining.ca/signup](https://sendstorytraining.ca/signup)

In 2019, I started doing competitive climbing and training. I was constantly seeking ways to improve, searching for training plans and coaches to guide me past plateaus, get better, and get stronger. I worked with a world-class coach who made me a month-long training plan for around $250 USD/month. It’s pretty cool, but the price was absolutely unsustainable.

So I tried the standard, pre-made, cookie-cutter plans (around 1/4 the price). Although they’re cheaper because they’re pre-made, they weren’t targeted to the climber’s own needs and are inflexible. I also explored hand-made plans from companies, which were again, well done but very expensive (upwards hundreds of dollars). The price is so steep because every plan is made one-by-one manually, driving up the production cost.

But do effective, personalized, and targeted training plans *have* to be expensive? Fundamentally, no. It’s 2021 and Send Story Training now replicates the manual process of building personal training plans through an advanced algorithm and code.

**How the app works:**

1. First, you’d answer some basic questions like height, weight, body fat (optional), current climbing grade, goal grade, climbing disciplines, equipment, availability, and preferences.
2. Next, you do a long self-assessment (answer questions about your climbing) and a physical assessment (your stats. Ex. max pull up, 1 RM weighted pull up, hangs…) The app then evaluates your strengths and weaknesses in all 3 critical areas of climbing, which are technique, physical strength, and mental game (Eric Hörst’s “Training for Climbing”). The app provides a full result-breakdown of each individual area. For example, your results for physical strength breaks down your power, core strength, finger strength, power endurance, etc, showing an in-depth analysis.

3. Finally, from your personal results, the app creates your training plan targeted to you, exactly like a real coach would. There are a couple of sessions a week, depending on how many you chose, and each session lasts a certain amount of time, again depending on your time availability.

&amp;#x200B;

**Extra information:**

Every training session targets your weaknesses and maintains your strength. This system is derived from the *principle of deliberate practice*, which is targeted and purposeful, helping you improve efficiently.

The exercises, reps, and sets are all different depending on your level as a climber. The training plan works for anyone at any climbing grade.

If you have access to a gym, the app will automatically pick the most suitable technique drills and mental game drills just for you, which helps you improve in those important areas as well!

Your training plan is on the app. It tracks everything for you:

Send Story Training is in the beta stage, so it’s not on the app store. We currently opened our wait list for free early access at [https://sendstorytraining.ca](https://sendstorytraining.ca/signup) (the higher up you are on the wait list, the earlier you’ll get access to the app).

It’s completely free right now because we haven’t officially launched. But we believe that every climber deserves a personalized and affordable training plan to improve, which is why we will keep the price affordable even after launch. But for now, sign up and early access are both free.

All feedback is welcomed!
Lattice front lever progression: starts with a nice easy hollow hold. Ollie's version of this with arms fully extended feels physically impossible to me. what muscles am I missing? (the normal arms by the side version feels fine).
Training hips/glutes for stemming I really enjoy climbs with serious friction stemming, especially big alpine routes. I’m finding that my hips and glutes get a “pumped” feeling on extended stem climbs, especially when holding position to place gear or rest. It leads to soreness in these areas. This has dramatically increased the difficulty of these climbs for me. 

Aside from just doing more climbs of this type, I’m wondering if anyone has experience with this and has trained to improve hip and glute strength for this kind of movement? 

To be clear this is not a flexibility issue (I don’t think). I do a lot of mobility work and some yoga but it doesn’t seem to be helping for this.
Is anyone here a strength and conditioning coach for climbing athletes? Looking to get into the industry and could use some advice. Just looking for some insight from anyone with experience. Thanks in advance. 

I’m 22 years old and I’m currently finishing my undergraduate degree in Exercise Science from a Pennsylvania state school. I’ve developed a huge passion for bouldering and sport climbing in the past two years and want nothing more than to make training rock climbers my career. 

My current experience is interning at a strength and conditioning facility that specializes in ice hockey athletes. I’ve interned there since high school and have expanded my knowledge of strength and conditioning, developed my interpersonal skills, and received a lot of advice on career development from my supervisor there. 

My current choices are basically either go back to school to get my Masters of Exercise Science or go gain practical experience in the field. 

I actually just got an offer today from a local gym to come be a fitness instructor once I receive my diploma. Not sure what that would entail, but I could probably talk them into letting me be a private strength coach that works with small groups. If I have to be some sort of HIIT/circuit instructor, I probably won’t take it. Are there better opportunities elsewhere in the country for employment like this? Is it really competitive? What are the average credentials of someone who is a private strength coach working with individual athletes/teams?

I’ll likely apply to a bunch of graduate schools in July just to see where I get in. Should I apply to schools out west? Are there any kinesiology masters programs that focus on climbing? (It’s probably a longshot.)

Those are basically all my questions. Thanks again.

Edited for clarity
just started the alex puccio training program that’s always being promoted on instagram im on day 3 and i feel like i got hit by a bus
Signs you’re in an unhealthy or abusive belayionship and how it can hold you back I am posting this here because the best thing I did to improve my climbing in the past two years was get out of an abusive relationship with a person who was also my primary climbing partner.

**The dream of it all sure is romantic, you and your partner, a van full of dusty climbing gear, and endless adventures on rock. A lifetime of love, bloody fingers, summit selfies, and maybe even a happy crag dog you rescued together.**

**The problem with our attachment to dreams is that they often obscure reality. And the reality is, 1 in 5 partnerships will involve domestic abuse. This abuse can be physical, emotional, or both. And it can happen within your rock climbing relationships- both romantic and platonic partnerships. The following essay outlines several different abuse tactics specific to climbing. Tactics are listed with examples given in increasing severity. If you or someone you know finds many of these examples to be present in your life, the time to leave is NOW. For the purposes of this article, I will be using she/her/you/your pronouns for the abuse survivor and he/him pronouns for the abuser. Abuse can come from all genders and is NEVER okay.**

**ALL OF THESE HAPPENED TO ME. I PRAY THEY NEVER HAPPEN TO YOU.**

&amp;#x200B;

\***ISOLATION\***

Isolation is a common abuse tactic in relationships. Here are some examples of what it looks like in climbing and how it can escalate:

1. **He wants to climb with you ALL the time.** It’s flattering when someone wants to spend time with you, but they need to respect your boundaries and existing commitments. For example, every Wednesday evening you always climb with your friend Mary, but he now wants you to climb with you on Wednesdays and Fridays. Instead of changing the dates to accommodate your commitment to Mary, he encourages you to not climb with Mary. He might even insult Mary and you to manipulate you into ditching her. (Example: “Why are you bothering climbing with Mary? She doesn’t have her lead card and never climbs outside, you can do better climbing with me because I also climb outside!”)
2. **Eventually, you stop climbing with your other friends entirely and no longer see them.**
3. **You no longer participate in local climbing clubs or groups. Maybe it’s a women’s bouldering night at the gym, or an annual volunteer commitment to help with a snow skills class. Either way, he finds a reason to devalue your group and insult the other participants.** If it’s the women’s bouldering night at the gym, that will suddenly be the only night he can climb with you. He may feign sadness or hurt if you assert your boundaries- this is an abuse tactic. If it’s an established outdoor group, he may create a situation where you are forced to choose between him and the group.
4. **You stop doing other sports if he does not do them as well.** For example, if you also like to snowboard but he hates the snow, you may become conditioned to only do what he wants and you will stop snowboarding. He will use emotional manipulation to keep you from your other activities and make you feel guilty for doing things without him.

**He isn’t happy if you climb with other people**

1. **He makes unfounded statements on your other partners abilities and competence.**
   1. Example: “Anna has no technique or skill for climbing, she only sends 12s because she’s anorexic and weighs 100 pounds.”
   2. Example 2: “You want to climb with those people you met in the outdoors club? They are gumbies who don’t know anything about real rock climbing, why waste your time?”
2. **He becomes jealous or accuses you of “flirting” or “cheating on him” if you climb with male climbing partners.**
   1. Example: You are at the crag with your boyfriend, Jim, and Pam. For one climb, Jim belays you. The entire time Jim is belaying you, your boyfriend seethes at the base of the route. For the rest of the day, he is angry at you and not happy about your send. He may hold onto this anger for months or years, and whenever you bring up that climbing trip, all he can talk about is how horrible it was that Jim was flirting with you.
3. **He may get mad at you for climbing without him and not “saving” a route for him.**
   1. Example: You send the Pioneer Route on Monkey Face at Smith Rock with your friend Lily. Instead of congratulating you, he puts on a show of being hurt you climbed that route without him. He will say bad things about your friend Lily and not want to climb in groups with her in the future.
4. **He will not look at your achievements and be proud/happy for you, instead he will take the spotlight away from your achievements and place it on himself and his perceived emotional hurt.**
   1. Example: He has told you that he encourages you to climb with other people, so you plan a week long girls climbing trip while he stays home. During the week, you climb many routes and have a great time. When you see him again, instead of being happy for you having a week of climbing, he only complains about how unfair the week was for him having to work and take care of your shared cat.

&amp;#x200B;

\***DEVALUATION\***

**His way is the “right way”**

1. **He does not respect any physical differences between the two of you and will not be sympathetic to you potentially struggling on routes that are in his style. Conversely, he will not want to climb routes that are your style. Eventually, the couple will only climb routes he excels at and she will constantly have painful climbing experiences where she is “not good enough” while he has tons of fun climbing. This further erodes her confidence in her strength and ability.**
   1. Example1: He will give you beta for a project that does not work with your body and then tell you that you are climbing it “wrong” if you try a move that works better for your body
   2. Example 2: A 6’2” man may insist his 5’1” female partner only climb the pumpy, stemming 5.8 route he loves and that she is “not ready” to climb the thin hands 5.10 crack that is the perfect size for her.
2. **He will not respect or acknowledge your experience and training. He assumes that because you have done something it must be easy, he does not respect the work you put in to achieve your goals**
   1. Example: You could have many safety certifications and years of experience climbing in a certain mountain range but on a trip there, he will not follow your advice, perform any training plan you suggest prior to the trip, or pack appropriate gear. He will then blame you when things are not perfect. You are his partner, NOT his guide or mommy and he should take responsibility for his own actions and preparation. He will then use this negative experience to reinforce his superiority in the relationship and that you are not a capable trip leader or climber when it was HIS actions (and lack thereof) that led to the miserable trip.
3. **He does not respect your comfort zones and pushes you to repeat many uncomfortable or terrifying experiences to “help you grow as a climber”**
   1. Example 1: You have social anxiety around large crowds but he insists you join him to participate in a local lead climbing competition.
   2. Example 2: Leading overhanging routes scares you. Rather than working out that your fear is from underdeveloped muscles or technique, he insists the best way for you to get better is to simply lead a bunch of overhanging routes that you constantly fail at and often take unsafe falls on. Climbing is supposed to be fun, but it isn't anymore and your progress is stagnating or even regressing.
   3. Example 3: An older climber will scoff at and insult a younger climber for "cheating" and "being lazy" when using a grigri or crack gloves when climbing together. They will continue to insult their younger partner until they stop using those "wuss toys". This will result in the younger climber feeling less confident while climbing and also not be able to practice their crack climbing technique leading to additional insults if the team climbs a route outside and the younger climber flails in a crack.
4. **He sees climbing as a competition and will not be happy for you if you climb a route harder than him**.
   1. He may insult you and say the route was too soft for the grade and not a “real” 5.8/12/whatever grade
   2. **\*THIS CAN ESCALATE AND BECOME DANGEROUS\* IF YOUR PARTNER SEES CLIMBING WITH YOU AS A COMPETITION, THEY MAY FIND WAYS TO SABOTAGE YOU PERSONALLY ON OR OFF THE WALL. THIS CAN BE THROUGH EMOTIONAL ABUSE OR ARRANGING A PHYSICAL “ACCIDENT” THAT COULD CRIPPLE YOU FOR MONTHS OR YEARS**

&amp;#x200B;

\***YOU ARE NOT AS CONFIDENT AS YOU USED TO BE\***

It starts off small, but it snowballs over time and eventually you will be left with a shattered psyche.

1. **You’re not leading the same grades you used to**
   1. Perhaps too much of his “training” has left you nerves frayed, or you’re still recovering from a freak furniture moving accident that happened right after you sent your first 5.11
2. **Places that you used to love (the gym, a favorite crag) now fill you with dread and anxiety.**
   1. After too many fights at Red Rocks where he accused you of everything from sleeping with your male belayer, to him being mad at you for climbing Frogland without him, you can't walk out into the desert without feeling dread.
3. **You no longer trust your own decision-making abilities without him**
   1. He has questioned your judgement and played devil’s advocate too many times for you to trust whether or not you’re strong enough to climb without him to “support you”
4. **You no longer feel comfortable climbing or camping with anyone except for him.**
   1. He has guilt tripped you and emotionally abused you after enough trips with other people that you decide it isn’t worth the risk of incurring his wrath so you only do things with him
5. **Projects and goals you used to have no longer seem attainable**
   1. You can’t remember why you ever thought you could possibly lead a 10c. What were you thinking, that’s crazy for such a little weakling like yourself. Or maybe you gave up on your dream to take a climbing trip to Patagonia because it would be too much of a hassle to try and get him to learn Spanish with you, and you’re still traumatized about the horrible mountain climb you attempted with him that he did not train for and blamed you for his lack of fitness.
6. **You don’t speak up in conversations anymore**
   1. You’ve learned not to use your voice because in conversations with him, he will zone out or not pay attention when you tell him stories of past trips. Instead, he will constantly tell you stories of his past climbs, often telling the same story multiple times.

**Climbing is a skills sport and you need to have a sharp mind to stay safe. Abuse rots your brain and your climbing will naturally atrophy. The only way to get stronger again is to GET OUT.**

&amp;#x200B;

\***I GOT OUT, WHAT’S NEXT?\***

First of all, congratulations! The path ahead is not linear and will involve a lot of healing.

Therapy, no contact (change gyms if needed), find supportive climbing partners, build community again, remember your boundaries if you date a climber in the future. Remember that it takes time. Depending on how bad it was you might have physical healing to do in addition to mental healing. Do your healing work, and also make a point to notice and celebrate your own healing and growth! You were strong before them and you are stronger now for getting out of it. You will recover and climbing will be fun again someday. It may to take months, or maybe years for you to rebuild your mind, body, and climbing network again but it WILL happen if you LEAVE HIM NOW.

Please, please, please be safe.
New Lattice Vid: How to write a training plan. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-fVHtCGimw&amp;ab\_channel=LatticeTraining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-fVHtCGimw&amp;ab_channel=LatticeTraining)

All seems pretty reasonable to me.

Anyone disagree with anything in this? I'd be interested to see what other strategies people have/ think are important
V10+ climbers, how did you achieve it? Hey there. V5/5.10d (outdoor) and 5.11d max (indoor) climber here.

How did you guys get to the grades V10/5.12d and higher?

How did you structure your climbing/boulder sessions and your strength training? (pull, antagonist, shoulder stabilization, legs, core, ...)

My thoughts were the following (3-2-1 cycle)

3 weeks focus on heavy bouldering + a few boulders in campus style (2 times a week) + 1-2x climbing sessions for fun, 2x max strength training for fingers

2 weeks focus on strength endurance (4x4 protocoll bouldering) + 1-2x climbing sessions for fun, 2x power endurance training for fingers

1 week easy climbing and training

repeat.

In every week I train twice: 
Pull (5x5 pullups, 3 sets rows), push (3 sets ring pushups, 3 sets handstand pushups), stabilizer (internal and external shoulder rotation, scapula stabilization), core, legs

What do you think about this?
What grade should I be expected to climb at a USA collegiate comp? Hello, I came out of high school a few years ago and really enjoyed competing for the local youth events my area has. But after a few years of continual climbing and training It seems to be my only turn for competitive climbing is USA climbing. Iv been told the competitions are very hard and I’m well aware that I’ll most certainly fail, but I figure I need to start at some point and it could be a good learning experience. I was just wondering if anyone on this sub knows how these competitions function, what I can expect and if it is even possible for me to compete in the first place?
System board vs weight training for beginner? Been climbing around half a year about v3/v4 level and decided to build a tension board because I like diy projects and I can only drive to the climbing gym twice a week max. All the holds I made from scratch with poplar wood and I'm mostly done with set A and B.

My question is if the board climbing will actually make my finger strength and pulling power improve? Would I have been better served with just trying to get a one arm pull up and front lever over time? Or is board climbing a good 1 stop solution?

Edit:
For those that are curious this is what I have so far(pinches are somewhere else but did those too)
https://imgur.com/a/3b2asdb

https://imgur.com/a/QqFRIL4

I used a table saw for cutting the shapes, angle grinder for edges, drill+grinder+vice for the knobs/slopers, and a belt sander/hand sandpaper for the finish. I also used a dremmel for the crimp edges.

I also have some leftover materials I might make a small corner spray wall as well with.
Triple Flexion Training: Are Most Climbers Missing Out On Potential Gainz? Hi everyone, below is an essay that I just wrote which sums up some areas of training that I think climbers tend to neglect, but that many could see gains from. It is not perfect, and I am not anywhere near an expert in training these areas. I mainly wrote this to get some ideas down on paper that had been floating around in my mind, and I eventually decided that some other people might benefit from it. I hope people can find some use from it, or at least enjoy thinking about these aspects of training!

&amp;#x200B;

In the current era of training for climbing, finger strength is all the rage. A quick Google search will turn up no less than a dozen hangboarding protocols, with countless Reddit threads discussing each of them ad nauseam. This is not without some merit. As far as single, measurable metrics go, finger strength has the highest correlation with climbing ability by a significant margin. However, is this correlation high enough that it deserves the current focus (obsession?) that has been put on it in recent years? Has the focus on finger strength in the training-for-climbing community contributed to a neglect of other important metrics? I believe that it has. In this essay I will examine three areas that I believe the training-for-climbing community does not put sufficient emphasis on. These can be summed up in the term “triple flexion” — the flexion of the hip, knee, and ankle joints. In addition to arguing for the importance of training triple flexion, I will give a few exercises that can be implemented to improve range and strength in each area. As a disclaimer, I am not a doctor, nor do I currently have any sort of physical therapy or personal training certifications. I am just a stoked climber.

The first, and most significant, area that I believe most climbers fail to focus on in training is hip flexion, and specifically the strength of the hip flexors, which are the muscles responsible for raising the leg. Hip flexion is the act of raising one’s leg, and there is no rock climb that does not involve hip flexion. In fact, almost every leg movement in climbing involves some level of hip flexion. But why do we want to have strong hip flexion — how will it improve our climbing ability? 

First, let’s think about hip flexion in the context of less-than-vertical terrain. Often, slab climbs involve small holds and technical movement. Upward progress is primarily propelled by pushing with your legs as opposed to pulling with your arms. Harder slab climbs have limited foot holds, and frequently require lifting your foot up very high to reach them. When the hip flexors are not strong enough, the body compensates by bending the opposite leg and pushing the hips back. As most people reading this will have experienced, even a slight shift back in the hips can be the difference between glory, and taking the ride. With better hip flexion, you can get your foot up higher while keeping your hips in more. 

This is demonstrated by the below picture of Tommy Caldwell climbing technical, off-vertical terrain on the Dawn Wall (source: [https://www.npr.org/2018/11/20/669573056/dawn-wall-climbers-gripped-razor-thin-edges-up-el-capitans-impossible-face](https://www.npr.org/2018/11/20/669573056/dawn-wall-climbers-gripped-razor-thin-edges-up-el-capitans-impossible-face)): 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3o4quvpygj271.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80017c24b626d30331837a79aa8c803e07f86962

Notice how TC’s opposite leg is bent and his hips have extended out from the wall in order to help him reach this foothold. Perhaps with stronger hip flexors, he may have been able to keep his hips in closer to the wall, thus achieving a more ideal position to pull on the left handhold, and in turn executing the move more efficiently (note: TC is the GOAT — no disrespect at all to the man).

While strong hip flexors may be beneficial in slabby or vertical terrain, what about when we enter the tilted world? Do we still see a benefit? As it turns out, we do. When climbing overhung terrain, the holds may be bigger, and we may be pulling more with our arms, but our ability to lift our foot high still has enormous benefit. Picture yourself on a 40 degree wall, 40 feet up, racing the pump clock as you’re mid-crux. You make an extended dead point to a grapefruit-shaped sloper. The next move requires getting your left foot on a one-inch wide foothold at hip-level and locking off the sloper to reach a victory jug. The ideal position to lock off the sloper requires maintaining body tension with your hips close to the wall. If your hips come out from the wall too far, you won’t be able to get the ideal position on the sloper, and the lock off move will feel much more difficult. This is because the more your hips sag, the more the force being applied to the sloper will be perpendicular to the ground, which will make the hold feel much worse. Conversely, if you have the ability to reach that foothold while keeping your hips further into the wall, and thus achieving the ideal angle to pull on the sloper (applying force more in line with the angle of the wall, as opposed to pulling down towards the ground), then you will be set up to achieve proper body tension and clip those coveted chains. And this doesn’t apply only to slopers — there are many hold types that we find in overhung terrain for which it is advantageous to keep your hips close into the wall.

To illustrate this, let’s examine a picture of Adam Ondra climbing Les Tres Panes in France (source: [https://www.climbing.com/people/adam-ondra-the-future-of-climbing/](https://www.climbing.com/people/adam-ondra-the-future-of-climbing/)):          

  

https://preview.redd.it/rpc55wrtgj271.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf41bef6e18ea7bef3725c57bf485718c69f052a

Ondra has phenomenal hip flexion, and this ability allows him to achieve the extremely high foot seen here. For most people, especially those of a similar build to Ondra, this position on the wall would not even be an option, as they could not get their foot up to this foothold while using the handholds seen here. However, because Ondra can, he is afforded more positional options on this climb, meaning that he can maximize his economy of movement.

Let’s now look at this from a training perspective — how do we increase our hip flexion? To increase our hip flexion we have two main aims: increasing range of motion, and increasing strength of the hip flexors. To increase range of motion, there are different stretches that one can do. Personally, I like to girth hitch a thick resistance band around a pole, put this resistance band over the hip flexor of one my legs, and while laying down with back arched and opposite leg flat on ground, pull that knee towards the chest. I hold this for three sets of one minute to one minute and 30 seconds. Here is an image to give a better idea of how this stretch is performed (source: [https://theclimbingdoctor.com/portfolio-items/jared-vagy-on-healing-and-preventing-hip-injuries-in-climbers/](https://theclimbingdoctor.com/portfolio-items/jared-vagy-on-healing-and-preventing-hip-injuries-in-climbers/)): 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rd2xlog4hj271.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=169cf6c08b5b41e55183baa507d556eef7077c30

As for increasing hip flexor strength, there are a number of ways that we can do this. Personally, I like to attach weight to my foot and lift it up (I have just begun to use Monkey Feet for this, which are a great tool). I do an exercise where I use my hands to lift my knee up as far as possible, while keeping my back arched and my opposite leg straight, and then I release my hands and hold my leg at this end range for 10 seconds. It is likely that your leg will drop slightly when you release your hands, and that is okay. Just continue to hold it as high as you can. When performing this exercise, I also like to raise my hands over my head, which helps to ensure that the back stays arched and more closely mimics a position that we may find ourselves in while climbing. This exercise can be done with or without weights. Another option here is to do weighted leg raises. Again, attach a weight to your foot, and then powerfully raise that foot up as high as possible. Then lower the foot slowly and repeat. If you do not have a way to attach a weight to your foot, then you can use kettle bells (just hook your toe under the handle), or you can do weighted hanging leg raises by gripping a dumbbell between both feet.

The next area that I believe climbers tend to neglect is knee flexion — the act of bending the leg to bring the heel closer to the butt (i.e. reducing the angle behind your knee). Knee flexion is important in climbing for a few reasons. 

First, let’s examine knee flexion in the context of strength. This is particularly beneficial when utilizing heel hooks — having strong knee flexion will increase the force that one can apply when heel hooking. Heel hooks are a commonly used technique in climbing, and being strong in them is a requirement for climbing at a high level. The stronger knee flexion you have, the more you can crank on (or just comfortably use) any given heel hook. Being able to pull hard on a heel hook can be a game changer in terms of taking weight off your arms and increasing movement efficiency. It can even be the difference between being able to do a move and not being able to do that move. 

Let’s look at an example (source: [https://www.climbing.com/skills/climbing-techniques-how-to-heel-hook/attachment/heelhookpromo-jpg/](https://www.climbing.com/skills/climbing-techniques-how-to-heel-hook/attachment/heelhookpromo-jpg/)):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vpo7syy8hj271.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ebea2c35df52d22077fbf7f41721430b1cdc483

Here, we see that this climber has a high heel hook and is preparing to mantle. In this case, the more this climber is able to pull on her heel hook by engaging the muscles responsible for knee flexion, the less she will have to use her arms, which will ultimately increase her chance of success in topping out the boulder.

Now, let’s look at knee flexion in the context of range of motion of the knee. A common technique used in climbing is rocking over one’s foot. This is a technique that can be utilized on many different types and styles of climbing, and the more comfortable one is in full knee flexion (heel into butt), the more one will be able to utilize this position. Comfortably rocking over one’s foot can be a game changer in terms of achieving resting positions, as well as reaching certain holds. Rocking over one’s foot is commonly done by getting a high heel or toe, and then pulling up and shifting weight onto the foot. The more knee flexion one can achieve, the more one will be able to weight that foot. This translates to more resting opportunities as well as the ability to reach certain holds. In a case where a person cannot achieve full knee flexion, they will have to keep more weight on their hands, and thus may not be able to make certain hand movements, or at least will have to make those hand movements in a less efficient and more difficult manner. 

To illustrate where achieving full knee flexion can be useful, let’s look at this picture of a Belgian climber from a recent World Cup (source: [https://gripped.com/indoor-climbing/2021s-meiringen-world-cup-off-to-incredible-start/](https://gripped.com/indoor-climbing/2021s-meiringen-world-cup-off-to-incredible-start/)):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/30fhyk3bhj271.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e590c4268862125149ec41f18d79cff96d67ff5

In this picture, we can see that this climber is in full knee flexion with his left leg. Achieving full knee flexion here allows the climber to put as much weight as possible on that left foot, while simultaneously putting his body in position to use the other holds optimally.

The second area where I see achieving knee flexion as an important skill for climbers, which is slightly more niche, is in the use of kneebars. Often, knee bars require full (or almost full) knee flexion in order to fit into them properly. If one cannot achieve full knee flexion comfortably, they are limiting their ability to perform knee bars, which will in turn make certain climbs more difficult. 

This picture of a climber on the route Urban Surfer at Rumney is a great illustration of the importance of being able to achieve full knee flexion in kneebarring (source: [https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/107267067](https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/107267067)):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fnxgcb8fhj271.png?width=667&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c69e535025a2e5c4ec780dabd43c326379a569fd

Here, we can see that this climber must achieve full knee flexion in order to use this knee bar. Because they are able to do this, they are afforded this great resting position, thus increasing their ability to recover and therefore send the route.

As for training knee flexion strength, we have a number of options. There are many different exercises that involve performing knee flexion with added resistance that work well. For example, you can do overcoming isometrics with a cable machine by sitting on a pad or low chair, attaching a strap to your ankle, and hooking that strap up to the cable machine at a weight you are unable to pull. These should be done at various angles of knee flexion. A good set/rep scheme that I have found is 10 seconds on, 30 seconds off for three to five reps per leg, per angle. Repeat for multiple sets if desired. Additionally, you can use the Monkey feet mentioned above and perform hamstring curls. Lastly, Nordic Hamstring Curls are another great way to strengthen knee flexion ability.

If you are unable to achieve full knee flexion comfortably, this is something that in many cases can be improved, it just must be done very slowly and cautiously. Do not work through pain. One exercise that I like for this is the ATG Split Squat. Here, start with one foot in front of the other as if preparing for a lunge, and then bend the front knee while trying to keep the back leg as straight as possible. Your goal is to achieve full coverage of the hamstring over the calf, and then come back up. Regress this exercise by elevating the front foot up to 12 inches. Do not go down deep enough that you feel pain/instability in the knee. Below is an image of the final progression, which is a flat ground, weighted split squat with the front heel on the ground and the back knee off of the ground. Do not start here. In addition to the ATG split squat, static stretching of the quad will help increase knee flexion range (source: [https://kneesovertoesguy.medium.com/knee-noise-d94b7e9e0df0](https://kneesovertoesguy.medium.com/knee-noise-d94b7e9e0df0)):

The last — and in my view, least important — area that I will discuss here is ankle dorsiflexion. Ankle dorsiflexion is the act of drawing the toes back towards the shin. Having strong and mobile ankle dorsiflexion is beneficial in climbing for several reasons. 

First, toe hooking always involves some level of ankle dorsiflexion. It is not uncommon for toe hooks to involve flexing your ankle as much as possible. The stronger ankle dorsiflexion that you have, the more force you will be able to exert in toe hooks, and the more likely you’ll be to send ur proj. Additionally, the more mobile you are in your ankle dorsiflexion, the more options you will have for angles that you can use to apply force on toe hooks, which will in turn increase your movement efficiency by allowing you to maintain ideal body tension, and also taking as much weight off of your arms as possible.

Second, having a high degree of ankle dorsiflexion mobility will contribute to your ability to use certain footholds optimally, especially slopey footholds. This is particularly important in slab climbing. With slopey footholds, we often want to maximize the surface area of shoe rubber that we get on that hold. If ankle dorsiflexion is limited, the body will compensate by bringing the hips out from the wall so that more surface area can be achieved on the foothold. Oftentimes, this makes a climb more difficult, because the handholds must be used in a less-than-ideal fashion if the hips come out too far from the wall. 

Now let’s take a look at a more specific example. If you are trying to rock over your foot (shown in the image below), thus increasing knee flexion, but you have poor ankle dorsiflexion, at some point your heel will have to come up, because your ankle is flexed as far as it can go. As a consequence of your heel coming up, the way in which your foot is applying force to the foothold will alter, and you may end up having to use it in a non-ideal position. This is particularly true if the foothold is slopey, and having as much surface area as possible on it will be advantageous. Conversely, if you have a high degree of mobility in your ankle, you will be able to fully rock over that foot while minimizing the need for your heel to come up, and you will therefore have more positional options. 

This is illustrated by the picture below (source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U\_qZHv4Fik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U_qZHv4Fik)):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qfwds56lhj271.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b726360606d5451c8c8baa23f5b88561475f430

Notice how the right foot is on a slopey volume, and the more surface area of shoe rubber the climber has on this volume, the better positioned they will be. If this climber had worse ankle dorsiflexion, their heel would lift up more, and they would therefore have less surface area of rubber on the volume, which would make this climb more difficult.

The third area where I see having a high degree of ankle dorsiflexion mobility as being beneficial to climbers revolves around achieving high feet, especially in slabby to vertical terrain. In cases where a foothold is just barely within reach, occasionally having a higher degree of ankle dorsiflexion could be the difference in achieving the top of that foothold, and not quite being able to use it. Admittedly, situations in which this is the case are not particularly common, but they do arise.

There are a few things that we can do to improve ankle dorsiflexion range and strength. For increasing range, I like to do a soleus stretch. Here, I start with hands against a wall and front foot a couple feet back from the wall. I then bend my front leg such that my knee goes over the front toe, while keeping my heel on the ground. You should feel this in your soleus, towards the bottom of you calf. I hold this for three sets of one minute on each side. Additionally, the aforementioned ATG Split Squat can help to increase ankle dorsiflexion range. 

For increasing dorsiflexion strength, we want to increase the strength of our tibialis anterior, which is the primary muscle responsible for ankle dorsiflexion. To do this, we can simply stand with our butt against a wall and feet one-half to one meter out from the wall (the further out your feet are, the more difficult the exercise). From this position, raise your toes up as far as possible, and then lower them down slowly. I like to do two sets of 25 reps for this exercise. Here is what it looks like (source: [https://kneesovertoesguy.medium.com/knee-ability-zero-549bb9889698](https://kneesovertoesguy.medium.com/knee-ability-zero-549bb9889698)):

Eventually, you will likely want to add weight to this exercise. This can be done by utilizing a resistance band, kettle bells, or by using a “Tib Bar”, which is an uncommon training device also known as a DARD. They can be found several different places online, and this is an example of what one looks like (source: [https://www.mercuryandthorfitness.com/products/shin-blaster-anterior-tibialis-trainer](https://www.mercuryandthorfitness.com/products/shin-blaster-anterior-tibialis-trainer)):

Bringing this essay back full circle, I want to be clear that I do not believe climbers should stop focusing on training finger strength. As mentioned in the first paragraph, it is one of the most important metrics for climbers — likely the single most important. My argument is that there is a current infatuation with finger strength in training-for-climbing circles, and this focus has contributed to a neglect of other important areas. I have discussed three of these areas here — hip, knee, and ankle flexion — and I believe many climbers could see gains if they began to train these areas with intention. Lastly, in addition to all of the aforementioned benefits, increasing range and strength in the hips, knees, and ankles will help make climbers more resistant to injury, which is another huge advantage that will help contribute to long-term health and gainz. Climb on!
Which Moonboard set to get? Getting ready to put up a wall in my garage, just curious what other people’s thoughts are on the different Moonboard sets.  I’m a solid V5 climber outside with a few V6 and V7 ticks, mainly looking for a good solid training board that will be good for making future progress.  I’ve only climbed on a Moonboard a few times over the past couple years and am not even sure what sets they were so I don’t have a good feel for the differences between the sets.

I’ll also have a 15 degree spray wall that I will likely be using for more endurance based sessions or for setting specific moves that I want to try/work on.
Climbing goals Since I'm 13 and have online school I have had the opportunity to climb a LOT more. I have been climbing 3 to 4 hours a day since July 2020 and I have seen a lot of progression, I have gone from climbing sixes to projecting eights and nines. I really love climbing and I want to know how far I could take this. What are your thoughts?

Edit: Thanks for all the replies! I was struggling to find answers from google so this was super helpful. I think the main points highlighted were to avoid burnout and injuries and to try and join a team / get a coach.
Is ARCing worth it for me?? I have seen on the subreddit a bunch before that ARCing definitely helps when it comes to increasing low end endurance capacity, but I am wondering if it is even something I should be worried about. For some context, I live in the South where most of the climbs I am projecting or will project are generally shorter and more power endurance centric. For example, Little River Canyon climbs tend to only be around 7/8 bolts with pumpy roofs or defined crux sections. Rests tend to be fairly ok at certain sections with huge jug ledges, sit down rests, etc. I  am currently trying to target a few low 5.13s which tend to be some 5.11 fluff into boulder cruxes of around v5 or so. How much would ARCing benefit me in this style of climbing or should I center my training on a little bit more intense endurance/power endurance training methods like up downs and 4x4s?

Edit: Switching from being only a boulderer to incorporating lead climbing. I am not super knowledgeable on sport climbing energy systems and am just wondering what would help and what wont :)
Half crimp form Alright, so I've been hangboarding regularly for a few months (mostly 7:3 and density) and feel stronger on the wall. But one thing I have always wondered is how to optimize my form.

I mostly train half crimp because I feel like it activates my forearm muscles the best, and it also feels the most natural to me. But I have found that there is a difference between "just hanging" and actively trying to "pull" with my forearm muscles. If I do the latter, I usually can't hold for as many sets during my repeaters because I feel like I've worked harder. 

I think this might have to do with my different grip types as I tried to draw in the horrible paint picture below. Which grip type is optimal to get as high training stimuli as possible? In my world, both of these are half-crimp, but in (1) the thumb is down, while in (2) the thumb sort of rests against my index finger and my hand is a little bit cupped.

Light hangboarding everyday has helped my chronic synovitis pain tremendously. After watching [Emil's hangboarding twice a day video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBTI9qiH4UE), I thought I would give some version of this a try.  I've been hangboarding once a day, 15-20 second hangs, starting on jugs and progressively smaller holds til i've done one set on every hold on my hangboard, feet on the baseboard, 1 minute rest between hangs.  I do this full routine everyday.  If it's a training day, then it counts as part of my warm up.

I think my finger strength has increased some, but I also do hangboard routines and havent tested it.  What I have noticed is that that my synovitus pain has nearly gone away entirely, and that I only have pain after a hard session on the moonboard.  Before, they were sore after every session, and sometimes even into rest days.  I don't think it's cured my synovitus, as my knuckles still swell a bit.  But it's crazy how much it's affected the pain; I wish I would have known this years ago.  Give it a try if you are suffering from the same thing!

edit:  I'll go ahead and add to be sure you are doing your hangs with the correct form (chest slightly pointed upwards, shoulder blades down, elbows slightly rotated inward, look at your hands or thereabout) every time.  Since the intensity is low, it is easy to do these hangs with bad form.  Doing anything with bad form everyday could result in injury. So be sure to concentrate when you are doing them, even though they are easy.
Finger crack fear I, like many other people from what I know, am not that psyched on finger cracks because I’m afraid that if I fall my finger is going to get torn out of its socket. Is this legitimate? Please share any horror stories if you have any just so I have some data to work off of. Thanks all!

Edit: by this I mean I’m going to fall and generally hurt my fingers, not specifically tearing my fingers out of their sockets, I realize that that would be very low probability
Tips for keeping tension/ not losing feet on hard deadpoints? Everytime I get a good contact on the hold my foot automatically flies off.
Alex Puccio virtual or in person training - is it worth it? I had seen Alex Puccio post about her taking on clients either virtually or in person. Has anyone worked with her in the past that has any input on what it’s like to work with her? Overall I’m looking for a well rounded trainer that will help me improve my technique, provide guidance on how to build strength, and have regular review sessions (in person or virtual) so I can keep improving.

Any input would be very helpful. Thank you in advance!
What's your favorite Climbing training text blogs? I'm not a fan of video or podcasts, I much prefer to read. It's been hard to find good ones, I just finished reading through the short posts on Tension's website, they were pretty good.

Edit: Thanks for all the links guys, I appreciate it!
Do any fellow shorties have some advice for this move? It's V8+/9, the only other person I've seen on it just keeps the low foot. I tried a high foot a couple times, but it feels really hard to get leverage off it.
Any specific stretching routine you guys use? Looking to increase my flexibility but im unsure on what kind of stretches I should do to?
What difficulty are you climbing in your bouldering sessions? Curious about how you guys spend your bouldering sessions difficulty-wise, and if you're seeing progression towards your goals.

1. Boulders you can certainly flash unless you are having an off day 

2. Boulders that you could possibly flash on a good day, but usually take 2 or 3 tries, more if anti style

3. Boulders that you could send if you devoted one full session to it 

4. Boulders that require multiple full sessions

5. Boulders you have sent before, repeating with better technique 

For "hard" boulders ( 3 and 4):

A. Boulders where you can do all the moves individually, but you need several burns to link everything 

B. Boulders with a "showstopper" move that you need to work over and over again before you get the move
How do you practice climbing from position -&gt; position? One day I was at the climbing gym and saw probably the strongest climber I've ever seen in person.  His movements were quick, quiet, and precise.  I asked him if there's anything he focuses on when climbing, and he said he imagines the next position he needs to be in and tries to be set in that position after making the next move.

I've also heard this advice from other strong climbers.  I don't fully understand the advice, despite how simple it sounds.  For those of you that do this, what is it like when you execute this well?  What is it like when you're doing it badly?  Are there mental cues that you use?  I can focus on only so many things while I climb.  Is it a matter of experience and adding movements to your movement bank and recognizing what movement is next?  


EDIT: The replies are gold.  I think the advice is indeed what Will Anglin/Rowland Chen refer to as "Position Over Everything" (P.O.E), which they go into great detail in episode 12 of Power Company's podcast.  Someone linked it below.  Moreover, it seems to be the more general concept of visualization applied in the context of climbing.  I'd highly recommend giving that episode a listen.
Friendly reminder to warm up properly, take care of your fingers, listen to your body, and know your limits. 3rd time blowing a pulley, sound on to listen.
Any weekend warriors here crushing v10+? I try and climb once per week but sometimes due to school and work as well as weather I cannot find the time! I’ve fallen a little out of shape but I am still hoping I can climb a v10 by September!! I am curious if there a lot of people who climb infrequently but still climb at a high level? Also what do you focus on in your training to keep your performance high?
Routesetting and getting stronger? Feeling a bit of a plateau in my (outdoor) climbing. i work as a routesetter full-time and am missing the energy to hangboard/moon board/exercise after work. Am able to get outside here and there on the weekends and (obviously) climb a lot in the gym. Anyone have any experience with balancing routesetting full-time and getting stronger outside while avoiding injury? Any advice is appreciated.
Any advice on how to stop being as nervous before or during a climb outdoors? I started climbing in a gym about 3 years ago, and it's pretty ridiculous how little that prepares you for outdoor climbing. I've been on the road in a van for the last 4 months, climbing at least 6 days a week in some form. And there is one thing that is undeniably holding me back, and that's just pure nerves and fear before and during climbing.

I've read all of the posts and watched all the videos on improving head game, but it really doesn't help, and it's getting pretty disheartening. I find myself on nearly EVERY route I do outdoors, harder than 5.8, completely giving up on a move because I'm just too afraid of even the possibility of my foot slipping, even on top rope. And now this fear has found a way into my head before I even start climbing. I'll find myself in a perfect opportunity to try a fun route that's definitely possible for me, but all I can think is "I'm just going to go up there, get scared, and take at the first hard move, so why bother?"

I know the cliche answer is "You're scared because you don't fall enough, so start falling, and you won't be as scared. Case closed." But honestly... How do I even start? I find myself just avoiding even the thought of falling while climbing. And I don't even understand how people can convince themselves to just do it. If I think of myself trying something hard, I just freeze up and don't even want to try because I'm instantly incredibly nervous. And it's not even the thought of falling that's scary for me, it's the anticipation of my foot slipping or not catching a hold when deadpointing. Just losing my control of the body position in some way. The actual sensation of my foot popping off a hold is so real for me and I'm not really sure what to do to get past it.
Finger strength is no longer my limiting factor. Should I keep hangboarding to prevent eventual plateaus? I haven't climbed consistently in the last 15 months because of COVID, but I got myself a hangboard and trained intensely twice a week since the beginning. As a result, I am now way stronger but pretty much at the same climbing grade. Obviously, my technique is now my limiting factor and not my finger strength.

It is now possible for me to climb consistently once again (inside and outside). What I am wondering is if I should keep hangboarding (mostly max hang) since I believe that my technique is going to catch up my finger strength to the point where my finger strength would eventually become my limiting factor once again. Of course, the idea would be to prioritize climbing over hangboarding.

I have been climbing for 4 years and my climbing grade is somewhere between V5 and V6 (I know grades are relative). I can hang on a 9 mm edge for a few seconds (Transgression hangboard).
Outdoor bouldering is incredibly hard Hello,   


I have been climbing consistently for 2 years now (3 or 4 times per week). And I am quite confident at the gym. But when going bouldering outdoor I feel like I have never done this in my life. It is incredibly hard. At some crags I can do V3, but it is already quite challenging. And then seeing people do V10 makes me feel like they are super humans, and I see no way I could get to that level.   


I know I need a proper training routine to get better. Can someone share their experience with getting better at outdoor bouldering? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!
Do you find hangboarding intrinsically enjoyable? If not, is there a way to get there? I've noticed recently that I look forward to hangboarding almost as much climbing itself. Friends, however, find hangboarding boring and unpleasant. It strikes me that enjoying it provides a big motivational advantage, and may impact long-term performance. 

This made me curious how many folks here actually like hangboarding or not. Also, if people do not enjoy it, I wonder if there is anyway to help them find ways to enjoy it. I'll post my own thoughts in a comment.
How to bring my feet up/use my legs? I'm a super beginner (V0/V1) and I've been given feedback that I tend to stretch my arms and stand on my tiptoes to reach the holds, rather than using my legs, which have been inefficient and even have led to injuries in my arms. But when I do bring my feet up, I feel scrunched up and unstable.

My questions: is the rule of thumb usually to push with feet, and only use arms for stabilization? What do you do after you bring your feet up? Are your hands just at your waist level after you bring your feet up? Are there videos or other resources to answer my question?

Sorry if these sound stupid. I'm still trying to work out how climbing works.
EP 56: Dave MacLeod (Part 1) — Jumping Up 4 Grades in 18 Months, Fingerboard Rituals, and Nutrition — The Nugget Climbing Podcast
Completely changed my approach to climbing (and 'training' for it) - Am I doing it right or will I fail (again)? TL:DR:

Six years of climbing experience, best climb ever was a short 5.11c. I'm six foot 7 inches, aprox 200 pounds. Never really got to where I wanted to go...

**What I was doing:**

Climb once pr week (Got pain in elbows climbing more)

Some kettlebell work (Kettlebells for climbers from power company) + pull ups

Some lower body stretching / foamrolling to keep some niggles away

Tried hangboarding every now and then, but I couldn't even do repeaters on the jugs

**What I started to do:**

Climbing 2-3 times pr week

Focus on elbow tendonitis prehab (tyler twist, reverse tyler twist, different stretches)

Some fullbody mobility work (GMB mobility)

 **My reasoning:**

I was trying to do too much other stuff while not climbing enough. I said to myself that climbing one time per week was ok as long as I did the 'training' as well. But I think I might have just been tricking myself? I didn't see any results. So now I've scrapped all the 'training' for climbing and I'm focusing on actually climbing more, focusing on my technique while making my body better at moving unhindered - hopefully allowing me to climb injury free. I'm more psyched than ever, looking forward to all my extra climbing sessions.

What do you think? Will I be able to see more progress with my new approach to becoming a better and happier climber?
Any tips for moves that cross the midline? I seem to really struggle on big, dynamic moves that cross the body's midline, especially those where you cut feet.  I think it's a commitment issue cause I can feel how loose I am when I touch the next hold.  I think I stay loose because my brain thinks my shoulder will rip out if I commit.  Which maybe it will, given that I'm approaching the move all wrong.  Does one just need to practice more?  What is your process when executing this kind of move?

The type of move in question is exemplified here (though to the extreme): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JdsfVo4jE&amp;t=96s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JdsfVo4jE&amp;t=96s)
Do we know what good genetics looks like in climbing? Obviously people like Ondra, Tomoa, Ashima, etc have some level of genetic advantage over the “average” climber or person, but do we know what these advantages look like? Do we have an idea of what creates a larger genetic potential in climbing?
What are some interesting ways you have noticed yourself getting stronger? It is probably more obvious to other people, but thinking back on it, when I climb, my grip in my hands 99% of the time fail before I start having any skin issues (tearing, splitting, burning from friction, etc.)

The other day, my fingertips began the friction burns from doing small crimps and slopers all day, but my grip was still around 80%.

This hasn't happened for over a few years. 

It suddenly made me realize that my new routines on hangboard and practicing methods at the gym have been helping.

What are some other interesting ways, that might have taken you a while to notice, that you notice you are getting stronger?
Anybody have experience with dry skin on finger tips? I have dry skin all over and especially dry skin on my fingers. It seems to come and go in cycles, sometimes it's really dry and sometimes it's fairly normal. You would think this is a boon to a climber as it means my skin is quite tough, it has a number is other draw backs:

- It gets so dry that it loses elasticity and reduces friction. Imagine a hard layer of plastic on your fingers trying to grip slopers. It leads to a lot of dry firing and finding some problems/routes heaps harder than most people. Often this gets so bad that I literally wet my hands, let the water sink in and then quickly dry them, chalk up and then jump on the wall. The water temporarily adds back the elasticity and greatly improves the friction. 

- Especially on multiple days of climbing in a row, they start to firm splits under the fingernails. These can get excruciatingly painful. These splits a perpendicular to the nail and take forever to heal. 

- It takes forever for cuts to heal. 

- When my skin is dry, it feels unpleasant. 

Things I've tried:
- moisturising. 
- moisturising with different moisturiser. 
- moisturising again. 
- wearing belay gloves all the time. 
- wearing rubber gloves over night - with moisturiser. 
- super glueing the splits closed to varying success.
- licking my fingers (when on my home board). 
- sanding my fingertips. 
- moisturising. 

My question is, has anyone else experienced this? Has anyone got good strategies?
Trying to up my pinch game. Is it better to do 30mn pinch workout one time a day. Or to do 3mn close to failure every 20mn or so on my desk ? I have a pinch block with weight that i can lift near my desk with my free hand. 
I could stack the time and do something like an 10mn/hour of pinching on/off for multiples hours or is it just more efficient to do one 30mn session ? I often struggle a lot the last 3/3 of the 30 session because my finger are sore while i think i would manage pinching every 20mn pretty well..

I'm asking that because i've been doing rehab for tennis elbow and find that it works really best to just do it a bit less intensive but every hours rather than 1 time per day. Which would make sense because i'm recreating a more natural way of stressing my tendons/muscle. Continuously during the day rather than 1 short time
Feedback appreciated - Did this Overhanging V2 as technically as I could but still looks sloppy Link: [https://streamable.com/75o92u](https://streamable.com/75o92u)

Hey!

I fell in love with climbing this year and really want to climb as beautifully and technically as possible so all feedback is valued and appreciated.

My amateur assessment is that I need to place my feet better, slower and in a more stable way without adjustment. I also think that when I flag I need to straighten my leg more and point my toes more.

Thanks all!
Autistic climber's rant on how he views it, how its changed his life, and wondering how he can improve Hi! Id like to first apologize for the wall of text, ive tried to split it up best i can. Ive been climbing for 4 years.

I've never gotten into training my mind or body for climbing. I was sort of thinking about getting a coach from my local gym. 

This is probably oversharing but I have autism and one of the traits that i gain from that is obsession. I've had quite a few over the years but i really want to pick one thing and get really fucking good at it, and i want that thing to be climbing. 

It's already changed my life for the better. I was a chubby kid and I lost close to 100 pounds just from climbing. I did a lot of things I'm not proud of. I was extremely depressed and basically never left my bed. Then i found climbing. 

another trait of autism that i have is trouble recognizing and dealing with my emotions. Climbing is an extremely healthy way to get my emotions out for me, because it's my favorite thing to do. I legitimately don't think i would be able to function as a human being without it. It is the only thing i want to do. 

I broke a bone in my hand recently and haven't been climbing in two weeks, and i can feel my mental health declining. It's been the only thing on my mind. Im losing sleep, im falling back into old bad habits, and i just miss it.

Currently i just climb. I don't do any training. I can flash most v4s, done plenty of v5s and a couple v6s on the kilter board. I have okay technical skills that can definitely improve. I'm pretty strong but can get stronger. I'm 17, very wide shoulders, 5'10 and 160 lbs. I pride myself in my flexibility. 

I mostly want to work on technique and building core strength. I've tried many times to build workout habits but I've always had a hard time building new habits. Advice on this would be great. 

I live in Colorado but I can't buy any climbing gear cuz I can't hold a job. Ive been mostly bouldering inside but I've gone outdoor climbing with buddies, mostly toprope w a little bit of lead and bouldering. Real rock feels so much better and I'd love to do more of it but I don't have a lot of climbing friends who get outside.

In conclusion i want to increase my technical skills, my core strength, my confidence in myself climbing(i hesitate quite a bit). Should i get a coach for the technique?
Most comfortable hangboard in 2021? I've only ever used the Trango Prodigy (B+ comfy), Tension Grindstone Pro (MK1 - B comfy), Lattice Testing Rung (A- comfy), Beastmaker 1/2k (A+ comfy), and Eva Lopez boards (not at all comfy).

Of those, I find the Beastmaker to be the most comfortable *by far*. I have pretty big hands and find the super-rounded edges to be downright pleasant to hang on, even when my skin is thrashed. It's the only board that I consistently *want* to hang on, even in the gym.

I boulder ~v8 and after hanging on a set of campus rungs for a year, I am pretty set on upgrading to a Beastmaker 1k since it seems to have the best set of ultra-comfy holds for both weighted hangs and one-armed hangs. However since it'd end up being ~$140 with shipping (or ideally ~$170 if I buy the micro edges, since the 8mm is really nice for min edge work), I'm wondering if there's anything else cheaper (and ideally American-made) that's still just as comfortable.

I've heard good things about the new Tension simple boards, but have never had the chance to hang on them. Likewise, the lattice boards are nice, but not much cheaper than the Beastmaker.

Are there any newer boards that I'm missing out on?
Rice bucket questions I’m trying to incorporate rice bucket into my routine to aid with rehab / prehab / warm up &amp; general relaxation.

I’ve got a nice big bucket and a ton of rice.  Overall I am pleased but my only concern is that the rice does not offer as much resistance as I hoped.

I have a couple of questions for experienced rice bucketers:

1. What type of rice do you favour? I’ve gone for basmati (quite long grains) and am wondering if a shorter grained rice (e.g. Thai broken) would offer more resistance by virtue of being more densely packed.

2. Does the rice break up over time into a sort of ricey sand, and if so does this offer more resistance?

Thanks
Should I replace regular gym with bouldering? Hello,

Im physically in a not very good spot right now (a bit overweight, poor muscles/posture due to office work), which is why I started going to the gym regulary (alone). The main goal for me is to get into better shape / get atlethic, but I dont know if the gym will do it for me in the long run (super repetetive, nobody talks to each other, etc.). Right now its fine, I can motivate myself to go to the gym, but I have the feeling that at some point I will get bored of the gym.

So I looked for potential alternatives and bouldering seemed like it could be the thing (because the "fun-experience" is more present in comparison to just lift the same weight 3 x 20 times and goals are clearer defined like finishing a peticular route etc.), but im not sure if thats the case.

Does someone have an advice or experience in that type of situation?
Climbing for Non-Verbal Kids? My 5 year old niece would LOVE climbing, but since she's non-verbal (autism spectrum) we're not sure how to get her started. We haven't yet found any climbing programs or teachers in her area (Providence, RI) that have experience working with non-verbal/autism spectrum kids. Does anyone have any suggestions?
Mental State while Climbing Bit of a question but I'm also just interested to hear other people's experiences with this. 

I've noticed that some days I just feel strong at the gym, whilst other days I can't even start problems that were easy during my last session. I've tried to stay pretty consistent with diet and time between sessions, but still have weak days and strong days. 

This week has been a particularly weak one, apart from one session where I was climbing with some friends I haven't seen for a while. I felt really strong and was sending stuff that I was barely managing to start during other sessions. Today I felt weak again but I did have a bit of a realisation. I have bipolar and I've been a bit of an anxious mess this week, apart from the one day where I was just excited to see my mates and even though I wasn't really thinking about climbing, I was able to climb much harder. 

Thinking back, all of my best sessions have been when I've been in a good place mentally. I think I understand what people mean when they say "try harder" now. If I go into a problem thinking it looks hard and I'll probably not be able to finish it, that's exactly what happens. 

Anyway that's my rambling thoughts for this week. Anyone else experience this? How do you get over the days where you have no confidence and still get a good session in?
Neil Gresham: Long isometric hangs actually increase injury risk? [https://www.climbing.com/skills/5-training-mistakes-you-are-making-you-can-fix-without-trying/](https://www.climbing.com/skills/5-training-mistakes-you-are-making-you-can-fix-without-trying/)

&amp;#x200B;

I read this climbing magazine article today and noticed that the first "training mistake" that Gresham lists is long deadhangs. One reason he views these as a mistake is that he suspects they increase the risk of overuse injuries. This runs counter to the advice I've seen from other coaches whom I consider reliable sources (e.g. Eric Horst, Dr. Tyler Nelson). These coaches often suggest long "density" hangs in the 30-45 second range to increase tendon elasticity, which reduces injury risk short-term, and to increase tendon density, which reduces injury risk long-term. I'm curious what you guys, especially the coaches among you, think about these conflicting pieces of advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Apparently this article is reposted from at least 2 years ago. This is important context that probably should have been made more clear on Climbing magazine's webpage.
Pistol Squat Training - Helping my climbing or just making my legs bigger? I have been training pistol squats once or twice a week for about 6 months now.  Initially the thought was that they are a compound movement that will build functional core strength and reduce risk of knee injuries by building a strong support structure.  Watching a few videos of myself climbing I have noticed my thighs seem bigger than last summer.  Now I am questioning if pistol squats are doing much more than making my legs excessively strong/big.  Does anyone have any thoughts on the pros/cons of the pistol squat for improving as a climbing athlete? 

I should mention a typical workout for me is 2 sets of 5-6 reps on each side, not trying to be the best squatter in the world just trying to have the necessary movement to perform on rock.
How to get better at slopers - strength wise? Look I know a bunch of y'all are gonna tell me that slopers are all about body positioning and I know that's true, but there are certain moves or climbs where my positioning is just fine, but I simply feel too weak in the hands to execute. What are the best ways to train that wrist-palm-finger strength? 3FD repeaters? Max hangs? Just climbing more on slopers? Let me know!
Ridiculous fear of falling I hope this is the right sub to post in and I hope someone can help me. 

I started bouldering last year but had to stop after only a few weeks when I found out I was pregnant. Couldn't wait to get back on the wall and was back at my climbing gym as soon as I could. 

Obviously I still need to rebuild my strength but what I have found most perplexing is a new fear of falling which is really hindering me. I get to the top and I feel myself start to shake and sweat and sometimes I can't even move myself to climb down because I am so afraid. So I hang at the top like a trembling wet leaf, looking and feeling like an idiot. It makes me not want to send it on some routes and I pussy out even though I know I can do it, just because I don't want to get stuck at the top. 

I have tried to train myself to jump off lower down the wall. It still feels incredibly high and it takes a huge amount of effort to let go. When I look up to see where I jumped from it is ridiculously low. 

I don't know what's happened to me. When I started last year I did not experience this at all. I just want to get better at climbing, I can't believe I've found something I love so much and now I have a stupid fear that's holding me back. 

Any advice would be so welcome. Please help me!
What do you guys do to get Into the try-hard mindset? A limiting factor that I’ve found in my climbing is that quite often I simply just don’t try hard enough. Like there are moves that are genuinely at my limit that I need to put in max effort for, but I sometimes have trouble getting the hype.

I know people deep breath, slap their knees,or other strange stuff. personally I’ve been trying a bit of hard breathing and muscles activation; like essentially just flexing really hard mimicking the climbing moves.

But anyways, what stuff do you guys do pre climb to get into “try-hard mode”
Is good technique just superior finger strength in disguise? Somewhat new to climbing but when I watch videos demonstrating good technique, the climber smoothly moves like water between holds.

I climb with someone much better than me and notice that even though I focus on mimicking their beta precisely, they just breeze through a climb with supposedly flawless technique while I visibly struggle to hang on to the same holds (even when I send it).

Which leads me to wonder: is fluid movement through a climb afforded only to people with superior finger strength? Once you're executing the right beta for your build, does it mostly just come down to how strong your fingers are?
Eric Horst's 4-3-2-1 Clarification Hi everyone,

I'm a 5.12is/V5-6ish climber looking to gain some focus in climbing to push my sport grades. I am going to start using the 4-3-2-1 plan (intermediate) in Horst's Training for Climbing. At a glance it seems simple and his example microcycle seems to fit my schedule well, and the first pahse seems to be something good for me because I tend to have head issues and I feel like climbing a lot will help. However, there are some things that I can't quite figure out. 

* During the 4-week period of climbing volume, he says that the climbing should be "sub-maximal" and 1-3 grades below your limit. This might seem like I'm splitting hairs but what *exactly* does he mean by "limit"? Is that my redpoint limit, or my onsight limit? My flash limit? 
* The same paragraph or section of the book also states that climbing during this time should be &lt;20% projecting. Usually when I think of projects, I think of things that take multiple days or even one full session. What is "projecting" here? Am I allowed to fall? I feel like trying out new techinques and terrain will naturally lead to falling and projecting.
* Somewhere in his book, he states that climbing should come first and then hangboarding if doing both in one day. However, my understanding from many different sources (maybe not all super solid, idk) was that because hangboarding is the most demanding on your fingers, that should go first to ensure that you are fresh enough for training. Is my understanding of this incorrect? Is this simply a philosophy difference? 
* During this 4 week period, is it OK to boulder once a week? I want to keep the "try super hard" mindset for that accessible; much like my lead climbing head, I tend to lose the try hard attitude quickly if I don't use it frequently.

Thanks for indulging my probably-assinine questions. I appreciate your time and I hope you crush your proj!
Not sure where to discuss this: why isn't La Dura Dura climbed more? Perfecto Mundo got like 3 ascents within a year after Megos climbed it, but La Dura Dura is still untouched after 8 years. I don't really follow climbers on Instagram or anything, but even on Climbing Daily or comments on Reddit/Youtube I've never seen anyone talk about trying La Dura Dura. Is there any reason for it? Is it really that tough? Is it 9b+/c?

I'm wondering because La Dura Dura is definitely not in a remote place like Change/Silence are.
Limited by my climbing gym. Ideas? I have been climbing for several years, and can boulder around V8.  The city I moved from had a nice climbing gym, and my school gym is not nearly as good. Obviously I understand that my college cannot maintain a gym like a company can, but I am always able to consistently do every single bouldering problem in the gym and am finding myself unable to progress as quickly as I did at my other gym. 

I have considered buying a weighted training vest, but  I have read that wearing a vest can damage tendons and cause greater injury. 

 I climb outdoors as often as possible but  I know I can improve faster than I am now.

What can I do to get better?

Is a weighted vest okay if I only climb jugs with it on?
Silence vs. Bibliographie Building on the discussion of La Dura Dura from last week...  I am curious to hear others thoughts on the perceived differences between the two 9c graded routes in the world.  My initial thoughts watching the moves on Bibliographie were that it looked easier than Silence.  Bib. appears to be a much more familiar style of climbing to a typical hard limestone route.  To my knowledge Jacob and Stefano have both attempted Bib. making good progress on the route.  I have never heard of anyone attempting Silence after Adam.  Could Silence possibly just be 9c+?
Coaching/Training Recommendations For a variety of reasons, I'm leaving Lattice after 5 years and looking for a new coach. Does anyone have experience with Catalyst, Substr8, or others? Located in Utah so coaches in the West that I could visit in person occasionally would be great. Mostly looking for coaches that I can build a long-term relationship with, and the substr8 model seems more geared towards seasonal training and doing it by "sessions" rather than month to month, which I find peculiar.

 For context, I'm a sport climber, max redpoint 14a, training age 8 yrs.
Shoulder health, injury prevention What do you do to keep your shoulders healthy? Be it warm ups, cool downs, yoga poses, general good practices.

I’m getting a little older but training and climbing harder than before, which is a great feeling. Except that my shoulders have been feeling constantly on the verge of injury the last month or so. 

If there is anything I should be adding to my routine or avoiding, I’d like to do so before these little tweaks turn into something.
Consistent A2/3 pulley injuries: prevention and rehab advice please! Hey everyone. A bit about me: 

I am almost 27 years old an I've been climbing a little over 4  years at this point. I got super serious about climbing as soon as I started going outdoors about a 6 months into it or so. Prior to starting climbing I was a gymnast for around 12 years, and was competing at an elite level for the last 4 years or so, so I came in with a pretty strong base. I've always felt that my body can can pull a lot harder than my fingers, and that my large muscle groups have way, way, way more capacity than my tendons do, even 4.5 yrs in. I feel like I started the sport bouldering like v6/7 in my style (but like v2 out of style, like most other people), and I continue to have a really big gap between in-style sloping/physical/compression boulders and anti-style micro crimp rigs. At this point I've climbed v12, but I still really struggle on V9/10 range climbs that are out of my style, even when I am fully healthy. I would really like to improve my weakness and continue to improve as fast as I can, but   constant pulley injuries are beginning to get pretty frustrating. 

The issue:

Like I said, as soon as I started going outdoors, I got really serious. It feels like since then, I have spent probably 70-80% of my climbing career with some degree of an A2 or A3 pulley injury. I think the disparity in my muscle and tendon development has been a huge contributor to this. At its worst, I believe I got an A2 grade 2 rupture which took probably 8 months to fully recover from. Apart from that, I have had a litany of pulley tweaks or probable A2/3 grade one ruptures that always take like 3+ months to fully heal. These injuries have always only affected my full crimp (which i hardly ever do because I am scared of it) and half crimp positions. Through all these periods, I have maintained full strength in the open hand positions, and have just continued to climb in these positions while rehabbing my injury. I feel that climbing through these injuries has accelerated my recovery (as long as I am very careful) and have been good opportunities to improve other grip types, like open hand 3, or back three half crimp (if my pointer is injured like it is right now). I also have never experienced a co-occurrent pulley injury; it seems that I just get injured when I get fully healthy and way too stoked. I should also mention that I literally have not had a single climbing injury that was not a pulley injury. 

Anyways, I am very serious about climbing and I would like to continue improving as much as I can. That being said, I would really appreciate any advice on rehabbing pulley injuries, as well as methods to prevent pulley injuries, or how to identify when a little tweak could actually be a harbinger for something more serious. I should also mention that I am a medical student I think maybe my inconsistent sleep schedule could be contributing to my issues? I also think that since I have limited time, I have a lot of anxiety about wasting the time I do have to train/climb... so when I am in the gym or outside, I tend to go hard. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated -- I apologize in advance for the short story!
Any climbers who started in their thirties and got really strong? Hey Folks,i saw this (slightly older) Article again and i am just curious, if there are other examples of Climbers (Sport\\Boulder) who started in their thirties (!) and got wicked strong. Not pro Level, but somehow in punching distance\*.

I wish you all a Happy Weekend and a lot of training motivation. Keep crushing!

Go-to sport climbing partners for projecting So my wife's been slowly losing interest in (hard) climbing recently. She lost a lot of fitness during the lockdown and is in a bit of a slump. So if she does climb, she prefers to do more adventure type easy multis around our area which I'm happy to do with her, but this isn't the r/climbeasymultis sub lol

I like projecting and I've always just projected with her so now that she isn't into cragging as much I'm having trouble looking for people to work routes with and give each other a patient belay. Not a lot of people like doing it apparently. We've always had a gang of people to climb with but they would rarely work on stuff and would rely on other people to put up some TR's for them or would lead something at most 2 times. I love this chill sort of climbing too especially if I'm going for volume but I still prefer those days where you're on a mission to send something at your limit.

I've read some good threads on how to be a good [partner](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/e7y0p8/how_to_be_a_better_climbing_partner/). But I think I'd like to know more on how the sport climbers in this sub meet these type of people in the first place. I'm talking about people who wouldn't mind going to the same 1 or 2 crags every week and be just as obsessed but to still have fun of course!

**For those who like to project routes frequently, how did you meet your go-to climbing partner(s)?**

**Can you make it work with a partner who doesn't like to project?**
My Thoughts and Experience as a Board Climber The popularity of board climbing has increased dramatically in the past year. There are many different types of people that have started using this as their main training tool. These are my thoughts and experiences regarding board climbing.

My background: I sent my first V8 3 years into climbing in April 2017. I started Moonboarding on the 2016 set in December 2017, and started Moonboard-onlying (I wouldn’t even climb the gym sets) from May to November 2018, doing multiple BM 10s (still proud of Pleven Style DG). I climbed my first V9, 10, and 11 outside in December 2018, and my first 12 in July 2020. I started climbing on the 2019 set after that, and I have only done 3 2019 BM V10, and 40 V10+ outside now. 

I would try to convince friends to session on the board with me, and most declined. It wasn’t fun for them; the climbs were uncreative, painful, and sandbagged. I was often the only one at the board. But now it’s common to see many people on the board. It’s the new trend, and everybody is hopping on.

I learned two main things on the Moonboard. **How to deadpoint properly** (see my previous post, I can almost guarantee that 95%+ of climbers can improve significantly on this), and **how to milk every bit out of the ginormous feet** that the MB gives you. This means keeping tension while extended and pulling with the whole leg to generate momentum.

Before you start committing most of your time to board climbing, think conceptually about what benefits it has to offer. If you are climbing on the Moonboard, you will generally learn to hold and move off decent size, incut holds. Like, you won’t see a 6mm crimp on there, or a fat sloper. The feet are mostly large, which will result in you either taking advantage this or neglecting your legs altogether. The angle is a flat 40 degrees. If you are on the Kilter board, there’s slightly more variety in general, but the style is the same. 

Because the style is so straight forward, I believe that **if your climbing intuition is weaker than your climbing strength,  it may be much more beneficial to your long term growth to use board climbing sparingly**. If you are new to climbing (\~3 years-ish), this is most likely you. You will benefit greatly from doing all different sorts of moves on various angles, holds, and difficulties. Climb on slabs, roofs, faces, with volumes to vary the terrain. You need to have a reliable toolbox of moves that you can access. A weird recycle sequence, climbing feet first, and understanding which way your knees should be turned can be as intuitive as climbing up a ladder. Climbing outside is not often a 40 degree flat wall with big feet. It’s generally more nuanced and complicated. 

If you have been climbing for a long while, really ask yourself if your climbing brain is stronger than your climbing body. Do you have new ideas for increased movement efficiency when you come off of the wall?  Can you visualize the movement of a climb even before hopping on? Do you understand what to do on a climb and just fail because of your body? I would be inclined to say that **if your redpoint outside is the same as your Moonboard or Kilter – 1, then you probably need to primarily work on your climbing brain**, which can be better tested on more complex climbs. The strong climbers that I respect the most climb 2-3 grades lower on the Moonboard than outside, and maybe 1 grade lower on the Kilter. I believe these types of climbers benefit the most from board climbing because their **limiting factor is likely their strength, and not their understanding of climbing**. 

You might be asking, “OP, you climbed on the Moonboard and went up 3 grades in one year! Why are you being so negative about it?” I’m not trying to be negative towards the board, but rather cautionary. I love board climbing, I think it’s really fun, and I attribute a lot of my current ability to it. I just don’t think it’s the catch-all best solution for improvement for **all** climbers, specifically those whose climbing body is stronger than their climbing brain, which, from my observations, is a LOT of climbers. 

Theres a saying that I once heard that’s stuck with me ever since: **Stay weak and climb smart. It’s hard to climb smart once you are strong.**
How to power scream as a girl? I feel like I'm missing that extra push when I'm trying hard moves. It's one of those things that seems to come so natural to males, but I haven't heard enough female power screams. 

I'm so keen on getting the vibe in, so that I can try harder. Please share some tips, examples, or description of what the power scream feels like? Help me unleash the try-hard beast. Many thanks :)
Movement and technique self-analysis: 1 year of climbing progress shown on the Moonboard. First, the comparison video: https://vimeo.com/576243287

**TL:DR**  One year ago I used the MB for the first time, and have made [a couple posts about my progress in the past.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/lfpkps/a_6_month_retrospective_of_my_previous_post_on/) I have made a triple side-by-side comparison video and comment on each boulder at several different points. Not as much progress was made in my Moonboarding from 6 months ago to now (compared to my last post), but I still feel/move much better.

----------------------------

**Intro:** Figured I would wrap up my MB posts here with a 1 year comparison, and challenge myself to analyze my own movement with more scrutiny. **Some quantitative stats:** over 200 benchmarks on the 2017 set, finished every V3-V7 benchmark with one V9/7C flash. **Outdoors** I have sent three V10s, a few more V8s, several V7s, and have a few V6 flashes under my belt. Yeah my pyramid on real rock sucks, the woes of living in Texas :). **Some qualitative stuff:** I feel much more rounded out as a climber now than ever thanks to working my weaknesses. My movement subjectively feels more fluid and natural on the wall. I'm much more mindful of breathing both on and off the wall, and feel more confident through hard sequences mentally. 

**Personal metrics:** ~130lbs/59kg, 5'8"/172cm 21yr old male. Climbing for 2.75 years now and about exactly one year since I first used the MB, 1.75 years of outdoor experience. MAW on the BM2k crimps is 180% bw for 7 seconds. Can deadhang on the middle crimp for ~5 seconds right hand or ~3 seconds left hand. Can't do any one arm pullups and can hold a one arm lockoff for about 8 seconds. Best campus board is 1-5-8 on my right and 1-5-7.5 on my left. Outside of climbing, pretty sure I can't bench press &gt;100lbs or squat &gt;200lbs, though I can pistol squat quite easily. I can probably deadlift around 200lbs. My mobility/flexibility is quite good and one of my strengths when climbing in awkward boxes.

**Notes before analysis:** 6 months ago I was using the Moonboard quite regularly, so a few of the moves will look much cleaner compared to now because of that. However, after making/watching this video, I feel like I can comment on a lot and wanted to share a personal dialogue with myself to others, since my last posts received good feedback. 

I will refer to the furthest left video as '1 year ago'  or 'left video', the middle video as '6 months ago' or 'middle video' and the far right video as 'now/recent' or 'right video'.

**Comparison Video and Analysis: https://vimeo.com/576243287**

*Brock's Bloc V6/7A*

- 0:03 : Off the bat I opt for a twistlock, hips-in approach to the first move as I did a year ago. This seems to require less push through the right toe as in the middle video, but leads to about the same momentum into the first right hand crimp. I would  attribute this style difference to my focus on movement lately, though I don't necessarily think one way or the other here is 'better'.

- 0:07-0:09 : I opt to cut from tension at the last second to swing the right foot immediately over to the next hold. This saves time and likely energy, which would prepare me better for harder upcoming moves (if there were to be some). I don't know if this exact movement would be optimal on a longer, non-Moonboard climb, but here it seems best. 

- 0:12 : I flag left foot further out than 6 months ago, and honestly I think I dabbed while toe-scumming the wood hold in the past. My body position at 0:13, when hitting the black crimp, is almost exactly the same as 6 months ago. However, my left foot came up the wall during the flag before settling on a smear position, unlike staying near the wood hold 6 months ago. I do think this is because of a small dab in the past.

- 0:16-0:18 : I bring my hips even further right than 6 months ago, as can be seen by my left foot's position dangling in space. I also keep the right arm slightly more locked off and engaged through this entire movement, a result I attribute to my recent training. This recent body positioning/movement difference makes the move to the penultimate black crimp much more fluid than both past videos.

- 0:19 : I have the confidence/ability to keep cross-body tension from my left hand to my right foot for going to the finish jug (as opposed to putting left foot on in the past). My knee is also pointed straight in to the wall, remaining slightly more closed off and hips in than in the past. 

Overall, I climb much less on my skeleton, more naturally optimize movement for retaining energy and making moves easier. While I take force off my hands easier with improved climbing, I also recognize when to keep a slight/full lockoff and actually pull through in a controlled way.

*Fede2 V7/7A*

- 0:26-0:27 : I opt for different starting feet than in the past, allowing me to make full use of twisting my left hip in, almost able to layback the right hand undercling.

- 0:29 : Six months ago I think I did this move 'best'. When I hit the yellow crimp, I have very little 'fall out' of the wall from any momentum. Note the dorsiflexion in my right heel in the middle video versus the recent video. My heel in the past stays slightly more depressed/less overall flexion. I don't have enough physio/movement knowledge to speak to this usefulness, but it is an interesting observation.

- 0:35 : The two more recent videos clearly make this move much better than a year ago, but not much has changed here between 6 months ago and now. Notice a progression in my shoulder engagement from left to right while holding the left hand crimp.

- 0:39 : Again just about the exact same body position as 6 months ago. Note however my ear well above my left shoulder in the recent video.

- 0:42-0:43 : I opt to twist out into a hips-square position throughout the movement, as opposed to twisting out then pulling through as I did six months ago. I would say this is slightly more efficient movement, but again wouldn't necessarily say 'better'. 

- 0:45-0:48 : Note the increased tension through the right foot as I hit the finish jug. Much better than a year ago and even a little better than 6 months ago. The biggest note here is how I immediately pull into a more locked-off position in my right arm. This is certainly making it easier for me to hold the swing now than before.

Overall I made very slight improvements in movement/efficiency on this climb compared to 6 months ago. Better use of shoulder engagement.

*Horsea V8/7B+*

- 0:52 : Note my left shoulder is much more retracted than in the past and I use it for the movement in addition to just pulling. 

- 0:54-0:56 : I opt for a closer foot that lets me tension until the last second through the jump. This puts less overall strain on the right hand and makes the swing slightly easier to hold. I also stay more locked-off while campusing instead of sinking into my skeleton. 

- 0:58-1:02 : I again opt for body positioning used a year ago instead of what I did 6 months ago. I am quite familiar with this move and have never dropped it, and I can't really tell if one way or another is better. I think this speaks more to my current mindset towards movement, than whether or not the movement was 'optimal' or not. Would be very curious about any comments here.

- 1:04 : I flag slightly higher than both previous instances for this move. The past year hasn't changed the fact that this move is quite tricky/low-percentage for me; I still fall on it regularly. Compared to 1 year ago, I hit the yellow triangle crimp with a much more bent right arm and immediately start pulling myself into it to stop the barn door.

- 1:11 - end : Different beta got me to finish the boulder. Left foot on allows me to twist my hip in all the way until I get left hand to the finish jug, as opposed to yarding off the right hand/foot. Even then, it's quite a hard move for me and I've only stuck it twice.

Overall I opt for small beta differences that end up making the ultimate difference, and finally sent. 

------

**Conclusion:** If you made it this far thank you! I would still love any comments or criticism so feel free to chime in anywhere. Making these videos has been immensely helpful for me to reflect on my own climbing and I highly encourage others to do it.
Getting stronger/maintaining my strength only climbing 2 days a week? I'm kind of slowly transitioning out of taking climbing too seriously and considering climbing only 2 days a week just due to my schedule and my gyms hours.  I'm probably a V8/9 climber and I've mostly just been climbing the hard climbs at my gym about 3 days a week (maybe 2 hours climbing and a half hour doing antagonistic stuff) for fun with no scheduled training plan (after years of pretty regimented training and grade obsession).  

Just wondering if you think just bouldering around my limit 2 days a week can actually translate to some slow gains or at least maintenance of my current strength.  Likely not too interested in targeted training training for a while, and my gut says I'll probably not lose anything, but hoping for some input.  Thanks yall!
Any experience with Climbstrong.com Membership Level 2/3 Hey everyone :)

i read the usual Books + did a Lattice Lite Training plan and am well able to build my own training plan.   Still, i'm curious and thinking about a climbstrong membership and try one of his plans. Couldn't find proper reviews though. Anyone here who has tried it?
Favorite Movement Drills Been adding movement drills into my training lately, and it seems to make a massive difference- after climbing for 3.5 years i'm surprised at how effective some simple movement work can be. I added balancing and traversing on smears into my warm up, and discovered that climbing limbo is also an amazing drill to add in with a partner. The rooting drills from power company climbing are another classic. What are some of your favorite movement drills to add into your warmup / sessions?
Any advice for outdoors first-timers? Me and my girlfriend are climbing (bouldering) outside this weekend and I was wondering if anyone had some good tips / advice for people who haven't climbed outside before? Any video suggestions for spotting tips? we both have climbed indoors for around 2 years, in the v5-7 range but I'm sure it'll be lower outdoors since that seems to be a pattern for most climbers. We have 2 crashpads and want to make safety a priority. 

Also, for climbers who started with indoor climbing and then started climbing outdoors more, did you notice any significant differences in how you climb / technique / strengths? 

Overall I'm super excited to experience some real rock, and have really enjoyed reading all of the posts from this sub in the past month or so. Feeling progression in climbing has been so rewarding and the strength I've built is something I never imagined myself doing (I was never really into sports until climbing)
Alcohol and training Obviously getting drunk even semi-regularly is awful for performance, but I'm wondering what the community consensus is on slo-burn 1-2 beers per day drinking and climbing fitness is, if there is one. Been climbing 8 years, climb 13a V8. Never really trained much other than just getting out a lot, but I can feel I'm starting to plateau, and I think if I want to push past 8a some changes will have to be made, either in training or in lifestyle, or both. Curious to know what you felt worked for you.
Is creatine worth it for climbers? So i’ve been taking around 5g creatine a day for a while now and I’ve definitely gained some weight (around 3kg) and was wondering if the trade of for strength is even worth the extra weight?
Does anyone have any anecdotal information or anything on this subject?
I wanna increase my range of motion. Flexibility is good. Hey everyone,

i already have a very good flexibility (front/side split, pigeon pose) and good normal strength (3\*8 Pistols), but i feel like i lake a proper ROM. It is mainly passiv flexibility i got, and not that crazy stuff some pros can do. Yeah, i am aware that they have years of experience or in margos case a gymnastic Background.I did passive stretching all my live and know what i am doing, but does anybody got some follow along videos, 30-60 Minutes long, that i can use as a starting base? My understanding is, that i need to load the muscles in a stretched position? Dunno tbh. :)

Look at THAT. Is that even legal?:[Megos-Split-Drop-Knee](https://youtu.be/5j3mROPVSKg?t=5256)

Thanks and have nice Sendday.

Tear this climb apart!! I chose this one for critique because it took me longer than I think it should have to link it together, and I made some unusual mistakes on the send burn.
A good example on how NOT to get injured to send a heinous 5.14a/8b+ project Allison Vest's [tactics to send her first 5.14a/8b+](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRY_n-bjmRU/) was nothing short of awesome and admirable.

&gt; Did NOT expect this thing to go down so fast 🤯. I scoped this route out about a month ago with @palmerlarsen and decided I wanted to try the heinous mono move but I wanted to train for it first. Then, after spending a month picking heavy things up with one finger I came back this week with the ultimate hype woman @alexjohnson89. It went down first go of the second day this time. Maybe gnarly pockets is my calling…⁣⁣ _([instagram source](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRY_n-bjmRU))_

Training the mono for a month before giving serious attempts on the route was brilliant.

It's so much better than to get injured/tweaked on the first days, rehab the injury with limited climbing for a while and then slowly get back to form to send the route/boulder an eternity later.

I think it would be easy for her to think she was more than capable to climb the route, as she's a pro climber that can one arm hang with +28kgs ([4^th video here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRO8_JPDFqa/)). However, she took the difficult path that postpones "the send" by being sure she could it minimizing risks.

This goes above and beyond doing antagonistic work and is a very good example of identifying/addressing weaknesses, while dealing with ego.

Any more good examples of tactics from pro climbers?
I have been overtraining for as long as I’ve been climbing For context I’ve been climbing since April 2019, climbed v5 outdoors, 12a indoors. In the last 3 years, I’ve gotten 4 pulley injuries, 2 from actual climbing, 2 from rehabbing those injuries too early and too intensely. 

I have always been in awe of people who seemingly climb every day and progress like crazy and don’t seem to get any injuries at all. I always thought that I was just prone to injuries, or something was wrong with me and that’s why I wasn’t recovering fast enough. I’d do two sessions, and feel so absolutely wrecked afterwards that I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t wrap my head around people who climbed 4/5 times a week, hangboard twice a week, and do other supplemental exercises too. After reading a lot of posts on this sub, and watching Dave MacLeods YouTube videos, I realized that I have just been climbing way too much in each session.

I would climb until I was absolutely gassed. Climbing until 100% of my energy was depleted. I realize now that that is not the way that you progress, but rather this puts you at a much higher risk of being injured. What I am doing now is climbing for as long as I can where I can give maximum or near maximum effort, and maintain good technique. When I can no longer produce a high level of effort, or my technique starts to decline, I stop. I’m using this extra time to do mobility and core and other supplemental exercises that I didn’t have energy for before.

I haven’t been doing this for long, so I can’t say anything about the gains or anything like that, but I will say already that my fingers feel a lot healthier, my body isn’t aching all the time. In general, it just feels much more sustainable. I can’t believe I went so long not knowing that I have been overtraining. Might be partly due to the age old recommendation for new climbers of “just climb more.” I think I may have taken that a bit to heart, and taken it a bit too far. 

I’m hoping my new routine will allow me to to reach my goals this year without getting injured!
Dealing with fear of falling after a big fall that resulted in a broken ankle? Ok so i can consider myself a relatively bold climber, i have always been pretty comfortable climbing on lead even as a beginner and this evolved into me climbing some bold routes with bad protection and big run-outs, also a few relatively hard free solos for me. 

2 months ago i took a 15-20 meters whipper on a sport route and with a bad belay this resulted in a broken ankle. Now my leg is almost recovered but i my head isn't working as before. I got flashbacks of the accident when i climb on lead and always think that the belayer won't do what he is supposed to. 

My question is if someone had the same experience and recovered fully. I am really afraid that i have lost my biggest attribute in climbing and that's my head. With proper fall training and risk management will i ever recover fully and feel as comfortable as before?
Imposter syndrome centered around technique Anyone else get imposter syndrome when you send a harder problem? I can’t get the idea out of my brain that if I didn’t have perfect technique and do every move efficiently that I “cheated” and just muscled through it. Is honestly pretty disheartening to be discounting my achievements so much. But at the same time, when I do send with really good technique (usually when I steal beta from a much better climber) it feels incredibly satisfying. 

Anyone else deal with this? Do you think it could be beneficial because I’ll hone my technique more? Or is it just a hinderance to my progress
No matter how hard I try I can’t get my legs to do the work. Seriously, on a lot of problems I just cannot get my legs to do anything. I’ll be thinking about pushing the holds off the wall with my feet and then two seconds later when I try to move I instantly default back to my arms and my legs either come off the wall or they just rest on the holds and my upper body is doing 75% of the work. I’m 6’1 175lb so it’s hard for me to support myself with just strength and I want to learn proper technique. I have big muscular legs though, so I don’t know why it’s an issue for me.

It’s to the point where I can only climb one hour and a little bit extra per session, because I just tire myself out way too quickly (I have ~30 mins of good climbing then one problem usually takes out half my energy). Near the end of my sessions I feel frustrated, helpless. And I don’t even know how to figure out what exactly I’m doing wrong cuz there’s so many tiny little things I need to fix with my legs and hip placement.

Anyone know how I can retrain myself so that I don’t carry on this bad habit? It’s already negatively impacting my climbing. Thank you.
How far can “just climb” actually take you? Me:

Been climbing for about 8 years now, primarily indoor bouldering with some occasional trad/sport and bouldering outdoors. Been pushing back into the V8 range after taking a year off of climbing during covid, which generally seems to be my plateau.

The mantra in this subreddit is “just climb more” when this question gets asked, and “climbing more” is essentially all I’ve done to get to where I am now.

My goal is to eventually climb v10 (outdoors) but I’m not sure if simply climbing without supplemental training (hangboarding, core work, etc.) will get me there. 

Surely I would achieve my goals faster by training, but I still feel as though I have a decent amount of room to improve technique-wise (especially in my anti-styles like slab) and want to use training as a “last resort” in achieving my goals as I simply don’t find training to be very fun and would much rather just climb hard.

So, given that I’ve plateaued at v8 for so long just climbing hard and with purpose, do I finally need to bite the bullet and start training?

Disclaimer: I am referring to training here as strictly off-wall training. I do feel as though I “train” on-wall (repeats, foot drills, etc.)
Bad Synovitis I don’t want to get worse Basically I have really bad Synovitis in my right hand. Im turning 21 soon and Ive had these flare ups for about a year and a half. I’ve seen an orthopedist three times about it, have done all of the exercises, taken off for up to 3 months three times and it always comes back with fury. When I take off it goes away but comes back the day I start climbing again and I really don’t want this to become a problem in the future. It hurts but I can ignore the pain and climb again. Pain doesn’t scare me it’s potential injury and long term damage. 
I know I’ve seen this on here before and I want to know if anyone knows how to fix this or maybe tell me it’s just gonna hurt and no actual long term damage. Just something to let me do my favorite sport for the rest of my life
Please help a brother out :)
Applying powerlifting/bodybuilding concepts to climbing Hi! I have moved from powerlifting to climbing and noticed that the sport is lacking in terminology for training volume. This subreddit has a lot of questions about how often and how much should I train. These people are given very generic answers. Some even say that you should train 3 times a week 2 hours at time etc. Obviously, this is not applicable to every individual and the answer changes depending on your training history and style.

Training volume and intensity are individual and dependent on your genes, life style and recovery (caloric surplus, sleep, stress etc). However, this problem can be approached analytically by introducing the following concepts: **maximum recoverable volume (MRV), maximum adaptive volume (MAV), minimum effective volume (MEV), maintanence volume (MV), adaptive resistance and training fatigue.**

In short, maintanence volume is the training volume above certain intensity threshold to sustain the gains you have made.  E.g. Someone could maintain his finger strength by doing 3x10 second 20 mm rung hangs 3 times a week. Minimum effective volume is slightly above maintanence and provides you minimal gains. At some point by increasing volume you reach maximum adaptive volume that provides the most gains but generates fatigue that does not dissipate from session to session. Maximum recoverable volume is the volume you can recover from, barely, but doing any more would lead to decrease in gains. Every training session that is sufficiently hard generates training fatigue that needs to dissipate, at least partly, before the next overloading session. Training fatigue cumulates during a training cycle, which is why you must deload at some point if you want to make the best gains.

Generally you should start a training cycle after a deload with minimum effective volume aka MEV and increase the training volume and intensity from week to week or from session to session. In the following weeks you will slowly reach maximum adaptive volume, which provides the best gains. However, as you become fitter and fitter you body accuires adaptive resistance and generates training fatigue which means that your maximum adaptive volume increases, so you must train harder for the same gains. At some point, maximum adaptive volume is greater than your maximum recoverable volume. At this point, or probably little earlier, you should deload so your MRV, MAV, MEV decrease and you can start a new training cycle as described above. This is probable the best systematic way of talking about training volume. Figuring each of these benchmarks for yourself provides the best way of structuring a training program for strength. The same concepts apply to technique, but explaining would require a whole another post.

This is the gist of it, but structuring a training cycle and determining your own volume benchmarks is a bit harder. All these benchmarks move from session to session since your adaptive resistance changes. There are many articles and videos on these concepts. I link one random article here ([https://renaissanceperiodization.com/training-volume-landmarks-muscle-growth/](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/training-volume-landmarks-muscle-growth/)).
Beginner: What builds finger strength most safely and efficiently as a beginner - bouldering or lead or...? I've been climbing for 6 months indoors (lead) and as I'm approaching grades 6C+/V6, I'm noticing the routes are getting more and more crimpy, causing a new kind of stress on my fingers. At the same time, lower grades don't feel challenging anymore.

Working on slabs and technical (but less crimpy stuff) works but I feel like the finger strength is holding me back soon as I pick harder routes. Even though I can progress on these routes, around half way I get really nervous about my fingers not holding. I always let go by then since an injury is the last thing I want.

Writing this I feel like this sounds silly. Like I'm asking for a hack to magically make my fingers stronger. But maybe someone else here has been in a similar position. I feel like most programs are directed at people who already climb hard. 

Is it time to Switch to some other form of climbing or should I just keep climbing as much as I can, without over stressing the fingers? Maybe bouldering? Perhaps getting better at the cruxes could save time and mean less stress on the fingers.

Thanks!
Gelatin supplementation as applied to musculoskeletal injury prevention \*\*I'd like to preface this by acknowledging that I'm not aiming to provide any concrete medical advice or anything of the sort, just wanted to share an interesting article my brother sent my way as is relevant to climbing\*\*

The synopsis is effectively that "adding gelatin to an intermittent exercise program improves collagen synthesis and could play a beneficial role in injury prevention and tissue repair," which could be translational to climbing recovery given the stress climbing places on tendons/ligaments.

It goes without saying that gelatin supplementation isn't by any means a replacement for rest, nor is it an excuse to rest any less, but definitely interesting to consider the biology behind the sport we're all here to enjoy! Thoughts? Anyone stumble across similar publications? 

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27852613/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27852613/)
I made this short anonymous survey about approaches to climbing and training. I'll post the results afterward! [deleted]
Micka Mawem. How did he do it? I was blown away yesterday at the Olympics qualifier, with Mickael Mawem outbouldering Tomoa, Ondra, Megos, etc.

He's always been a decent competition boulderer, but it is incredible how he levelled up in just about a year and already in his 30s.

From what I can seen from videos about him, is that he already had elite finger strength and upper-body power, but now he's somehow managed to dramatically improve his kinesthetics and mental skills.

Any thought's or theories on how he's done it?
Stuck between a rock and a hard place with climbing &amp; my health. Edit: 

update 3/9/22. I've been climbing on my home moonboard twice a month. I plan on climbing a lot more and risking a clot in 2022 if I can keep the wall. The house its on is being destroyed, so I have to tear it down. I'll find out within the month.

update 8/11/21. I think I was misdiagnosed or overly-aggressive diagnosed. **My second opinion told me surgery would be ridiculous before a clot even happens, I may never clot, and the clot may be in the wrong spot for the surgery I was recommended** (and had already properly received on my right side). My symptoms seem nerve related, my vein is healthy, compression is normal in lots of people. I am getting a third opinion in November from the best thoracic outlet specialist in my city. Until then, I am going to be climbing a couple times per week, trying to limit fully overhead moves. I am in control of my health and plan, which is great. I wish my first surgeon didn’t recommend a major surgery after 1 scan. 

Original post: TLDR at the bottom. Here’s a story about climbing, blood clots, and difficult decisions. A few of you might recognize this because I’m an IG moonboard spammer, who shares a lot of stories. 

Two years ago I sent a V8 project on the 2017 moonboard, and the pump never went away. My hand turned reddish-blue, and insane veins started to grow on top of my arm and chest. After a day of agony I went to the ER, where a blood clot was found in my subclavian vein (under my collarbone). It’s called VTOS or effort thrombosis in this case. The clot was removed the next day, but it immediately returned. I had to urgently get my first rib, neck scalenes, and subclavian muscle removed in order to decompress the area &amp; prevent further clotting. It worked. Four days in the hospital, an 8 hour surgery, some NSFL hospital incidents, inability to move my torso or neck for over a week, unable to cook, clean or dress myself for 2 weeks, unable to drive for 3 weeks, unable to lift my arm for 4 weeks... all while in severe post-op pain. 

Finally started PT at week 4, and was able to return to gentle climbing 3-4 months later. I felt normal after 6 months. Took a bit longer to feel normal doing “long” duration arm activities like cleaning the bathroom or even brushing my teeth. About 1/100,000 people get this type of blood clot. About 5% of that population have issues on the other (bilateral) side. It turns out I’m in the 5% of the 1/100,000. Here we go again. 

Recently I have been having jugular vein swelling in my neck when my left arm is raised above my head. This is coupled with pinching and tightness across my neck and collarbone area. The pinching symptoms actually started immediately after surgery 1 in 2019, but the jugular swelling is brand new. I reached out to my surgeon, who immediately ordered an MRI of my veins (MRV/MRA) for the next week. Got the scan last Thursday. 

The good news: my right side (OG surgery) is still all clear and healthy. My left side (new issues) does not have any clotting or damage to the vein. There’s no clot forming and I’m not in a panicked state. 

The bad news: when my left arm is over my head, there is “focal high grade narrowing” of the subclavian vein. After talking to my surgeon, who is the chief of vascular surgery at a major Boston hospital, he said “I would operate on that if you want.” And elaborated, “if you keep climbing with this level of vein narrowing, you are at a high risk for a clot forming on this side.” If I opt to get my left side decompressed, it will be a 5 day hospital stay, a high risk for fluid in my lungs (happens often on left side compared to right), and I won’t feel normal doing daily activities for 6ish months again. 

The good-ish news: I’m not in immediate danger. I’m 25 and otherwise pretty healthy. When my arms are by my side, the veins are totally clear and healthy. There is no urgency to rush me into the OR like in 2019. My surgeon says there’s a low risk of anything dangerous happening if I don’t do the surgery but also cease any strenuous arm activities like climbing, rowing, lifting, calisthenics. 

The extra fucked up part: choose between not climbing or an intense surgery, many medical bills, unimaginable amounts of pain &amp; dysfunction. I just bought a scamp trailer and was literally about to embark on a cross country bouldering trip with my girlfriend in a couple weeks. We are heart broken. 

The bizarre parts: I started climbing when I was 18 because it was the only thing in my life that took me out of a heavy depression and anxiety. I was plagued by GI infections &amp; inflammation, and climbing gave me a break and social life outside of my chronic illnesses health. Once I fell in love with it, I basically started living at the gym. I stopped using substances so often and was able to grow, mature, become healthier, meet my favorite people in the world, and begin to see myself loving the rest of my life. Now I’m finally healthy enough in terms of my digestive illnesses to travel &amp; explore. Jokes on me: climbing + my anatomy + bad luck got me into this mess. 

I got my bad test results the day of the Olympics. I’m anti psyched on comp climbing right now, despite looking forward to this day for 3 years.

I’m getting second and third opinions from other TOS specialists. Thankfully I have time to “play around” before making any decisions. I’m currently on my third week of no climbing, but my home moonboard (built during lockdown summer 2020) &amp; the Olympics are tempting me to try some 1.5 arm climbing where I don’t lift my left arm above my head. Kinda scared to even load the arm now that I know it’s so compressed when above my head. 

What I’m leaning towards right now: putting off the surgery for a year, not climbing, just hiking and exploring with my trailer and girlfriend. Losing all chest muscle mass. Hoping COVID is over so the surgery + visitor situation is less stressful. Doing lots of health anxiety / PTSD related therapies during the year to find peace with the fact that I’ll need the surgery, will survive, and will be rewarded by a less restricted life full of climbing. 

**TL:DR** CHECK THE EDIT / update at the top of this post. **I have to pick between an agonizing surgery with a long recovery or stop climbing. I’m hoping there’s some nuance there once I speak to other specialists. I was about to travel around the country for the first time, as I overcame unrelated debilitating illnesses earlier in my 20s. Climbing helped shape me into the person I am today, but I don’t want to lose it, but I don’t want that surgery &amp; recovery again.**

I’m not sure if anyone is going to read this whole post. I’m not necessarily looking for advice or sympathy. Feel free to reach out with any questions or experiences. I’m getting great support and love from friends and family. Please, go enjoy your healthy veins and the best sport in the world. For now I’ll be climbing in my dreams.
How the heck Janja is that strong ? She made a decent run in speed, a good run in lead, and **flashed all boulders**. The level gap between her and the others seems to be way bigger than between the top male athletes. At this point she may even compete in the male bouldering category ^((ok guys figure of speech)).
How to improve recovery time between attempts, what do I train? I used to train quite meticulously as a youth competitive climber, but I stopped training around V11 outdoor- my power endurance was always pretty weak relative to that, but I was able to go hard on a boulder problem for hours with ~5-10 minute rests between attempts.

Ever since severely dialing back my climbing due to life getting in the way, I feel like I can still pull as hard as I used to, but then my forearms are just gone for like 30 minutes of resting which is crazy. The effect is worse on longer problems which could indicate maybe I should target power endurance? Any advice?
A friend lost his big toe from the knuckle up. How can he overcome this and still fill out his climbing shoe? I was thinking he could possibly fill the gap with a 3d printed prosthetic or with shaped foam to go in place where his toe used to be. You don't NEED to be wiggling your toe around in a shoe, you just need a tight fit. Any thoughts or experience to overcome this?

I recognize this is the internet and jokes will always be cracked, but I'm really looking for a serious discussion as this is a life altering issue. Thanks.
Downclimbing: Is it even worth the pump? I've recently injured myself (separated shoulder) and haven't been able to boulder much or get on harder lead routes so I started climbing/downclimbing auto-belay routes in the gym (usually 5.9 - 5.11 depending on the route). I have finally been able to trust my shoulder a bit more, and I feel like all the eccentric movements with downclimbing has improved my control/coordination on boulders. I've always had pretty decent power-endurance (shocking because I boulder 90% of the time), but I think this downclimbing has also begun to improve this ability as well. I've been hopping on some V6ish routes and am able to lap them like I couldn't before... kind of anecdotal here, but I'm digging the downclimb training. 

Do any of you all include downclimbing in your training routine? Has it helped your overall climbing ability, or does it just yield negligible gains when compare to up-climbing alone?
People who consistently climb 4+ days/week: how long did it take for you to reach that level, and what are your tips for sustainably recovering? I've been climbing for about 3.5 years now, and one area where I've stagnated for quite a while is how frequently I'm able to climb. It only took about a year before I could comfortably climb 3 days per week, but never two days in a row. Every once in a while I'll test the waters and try going back-to-back, only to be quickly reminded that my body can't take it (yet). My skin burns, my elbows ache, my pulleys complain, and generally feel weak. I'm at least a solid V grade below what I'm able to climb otherwise.

Any tips for breaking into 4 days/week of quality sessions would be appreciated. Or is it unrealistic to expect more from my body at this tenure? I'd climb every day if I could. 

For reference, I'm a man in his early 20s. No health issues or dietary restrictions other than avoiding beef. I get about 7 hours of sleep on weeknights, 8-9 on weekends. Thanks
Starting from Scratch Again Used to be a good climber with good form and muscles. Now I’m trying to get back into it after 2 years of getting drunk daily. I’ve lost all skill and muscle. 

Has anybody else been in this situation? And if so, how did you start? Thanks!
Moonboard etiquette About to start implementing the moonboard into my training, and just wondering if there are any unwritten rules while using the board. One question does come to mind though:

Can more than one person use the board at once?

Since it's a fairly small board, not sure if you're only meant to let one person climb at a time. Something else I couldn't get my head round is how you'd connect your phone to the board if someone else is there. Assuming you can't have more than one person connected at once, and would be really awkward to keep switching between 2 people.
How to project properly? I recently posted a video of my first v7-8 bouldering problem.  What I'm beginning to realize is that I haven't ever really "tried," very hard to learn a problem.  I've just been naturally able to climb v5-6 and haven't really pushed my bounds up until now, and it took me about 2 hours of "projecting" to push over the plateu I thought I had.  Maybe I was just not invested enough or I wasn't confident; whatever the case, I am now aware that even after projecting a problem, I don't seem to have the beta dialed in, and my technique is lacking greatly, thanks to some feedback from other members here.  

&amp;#x200B;

So even if I can muscle through a problem until I make it through, I don't think I'm actually improving my technique or even improving beyond "I can do this move," even if its inefficient and sloppy.  Seems to me that just being able to do the moves isn't enough, I've got to be able to do the moves flawlessly too.  

&amp;#x200B;

What are you all doing in order to ensure that you're not just learning the route, but actually understanding it on a deeper level and dialing in the beta?  The first problem I've ever had to project for more than a few attempts and I send, only to realize I didn't really learn a whole lot in the process anyways.
How well rounded of a climber are you? Has your main style improved by climbing your anti style? Note: I just boulder, so the rest is written in that context.

I've been tempted to just focus on certain styles, i.e., powerful, overhung, roofs, etc.  I tend to focus on these already, but I've been curious what would happen if I totally just dropped vert wall stuff from my climbing.  On one hand, I could spend more time on my style and getting better at it.  On the other hand, I'll get shut down by vMax-3 problems of my anti-style.

I guess I'm okay with that.  Do I want a T-shaped skillset or a uniformly shaped skilllset?  I think T-shaped is more interesting to me since you have you learn all the possible nuances that you can to improve.  One might say that your anti-style is more challenging, so you should do it.  I wouldn't necessarily agree with that.  Climbing at your limit in your style is just as challenging, but the benefit is that you can get psyched for it.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
Importance of Skin at Lower Grades? I often see the top climbers obsessing over their skin, but my question is how much does it matter for us normal folk who project at lower grades (V5-7). Is it worth going down the skin care rabbit hole? Right now I basically just sand down skin and moisturize, but I'm tempted by all of the fancy Rhino Skin products. I'm in the middle of a humid Maryland summer which makes me even more tempted. Of course, getting stronger and working technique is the priority to progress, but would you recommend trying out some of these products?

Edit: really appreciate everyone’s advice! Some great points made. I think I’m going to give the rhino skin performance a shot. Worst case scenario I waste some money and have weird skin for a bit. Best case scenario I crush all my projects. 🤙 will probably take some experimenting to find the right routine for me.
How many different boulder problems should I be aiming per session and at which grade level? My goal is to improve my technique. I just joined a new bouldering gym that is further away from my place but has way more problems with more variety. This gym has about 10 problems per grade.

I'm a V5 climber (gym grade), meaning I will flash half of the V5 and should be able to send the rest of them under a few tries. Technique and problem solving is what I need to improve; I'm already strong and should be climbing higher grades considering my stats.

Since that the climbing sessions are limited to 2 hours and that I have a limited number of climbs before my forearms give up, I was wondering how I should structure my climbing sessions. Should I be climbing all the V4 and V5 as prefectly as I can? Or would it be better to pick a V7 and try to send it under one session?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: forgot to mention, I have been climbing for 4 years.
How much does sleep affect your climbing performance? Last week I took a 2 hour nap before going to the gym, and I sent my project first try as well as some other hard boulders that I couldn’t get before. I thought it was just me getting stronger, but I’ve been trying to repeat those problems and I’ve not been able to even get close since that day. 

Was it the 2 hour nap that helped or is something else going on? I don’t usually get great sleep as I have a baby that makes it hard to get more than 6 hours a night. I usually get 5-6 hours of sleep a night, so it makes sense to me that the extra 2 hours made a difference, but I didn’t expect it to be that drastic.
Breaking V5-6 - mixed advice I get mixed advice so often on how to improve.
If I had to try pinpoint my main weakness, it would be that I struggle to make myself really try hard.
I’ve been climbing about 2 years but COVID took almost a year of that so not really.
I got to v4 very fast and get the odd 5-6 and had one 7 
but I always come off them thinking they were set soft. 
So I’ve pretty much been at this level with no real improvement for 60-70% of the time I’ve been climbing.

I generally climb 3 times a week, always love it but I’m getting tired of not improving now and losing motivation.

I’ve been told to focus all training to being on the wall, as in, the best way to get better at climbing, is to climb. 
Which makes sense but I feel I need to be stronger now to get somewhere.
What are some ways you can die/get injured when lead climbing? Particularly via miscommunication or user error? [removed]
Not needing rest days? I’ve been climbing for about 3 years now and I’ve progressed to v8-9. I’m 6’6 and I’ve really worked on my weakness (strength wise) this year which really helped me progress fast. I’m absolutely addicted to climbing and I find it almost impossible to take a rest day. I’ll climb 5 days in a row and send some of my hardest boulders on the last day. I’m always doing injury prevention exercises but I was wondering if anyone else seems to not have to take rest days? Don’t get me wrong though, I feel amazing and strong as hell if I take 2-3 days off but it’s not necessarily needed when I force myself to try hard.
New Tension Board app is a disappointment Edit: kudos to the tension team for listening to user input and switching back to the Aurora app! It has got to be difficult, when you have invested a ton of time and money in another platform, to backtrack. Super commendable decision and makes me think a lot higher if the company. It appears to just be in the beta testing position currently. If you email support@auroraclimbing.com, you can get beta access to the new/old app.





Sorry in advance for the rant. Is anyone else really frustrated with the new tension board app?  I own a board and use it several times a week.  I tried to be open minded and patient about the new app, but that is getting exceedingly difficult. I cannot help but get angry every time I use it. 

The old app was great. It had a few quirks but was simple and easy to use. I had a huge folder of climbs for warming up at every level, endurance, power, etc.  There were a ton of routes that were easy to find and project. It was reliable and worked really well. 

The new app drives me absolutely insane.  It takes tons of clicks to get to the climbs. You cannot sort playlists by grade (or anything else). Filtering climbs in any way just doesn’t work. Every time you go back to the list, it resets the list. You have to select the bulb every time you want to send a problem to the board rather than just doing it automatically. The match/no match symbol just switches back and forth at random when viewing the same problem, thus making it meaningless. Not to mention that the symbol is randomly applied to the thousands of routes set prior to the switch. There are no dates for sends, making it impossible to see which routes are newest or what angle it was sent at first (made worse by the fact that sorting by newest does not work). You cannot view V and font grades at the same time. The benchmarks do not make sense as benchmarks, some even having easier grades at steeper angles?  The Home Screen asks you to upgrade to the premium version in 8 different places. Why would anyone pay for the experimental advanced features of an app that so thoroughly botched the very basics (that had already been very effectively designed and basically perfected in the prior app)?  IMO, these machine learning tools are a hammer looking for a nail. Were people asking for an Ai to recommend climbs?  I just do not get the appeal. Furthermore, I find it hard to imagine how those tools would ever work better than selecting climbs myself, even if it were implemented well. 

The worst part is, even if they were to iron out all of the many bugs, the new app will never be as usable as the old one. The interface is just so clunky and clearly aimed at upselling rather than being usable, it will always be a pain in the ass to use. This is a major downgrade for everyone who owns or uses a tension board. For me, it devalues a significant investment. I am moving soon and considering just selling my board when I do. On the other hand, I would seriously pay the full price of the upgrade to revert to the old app and have it provided with ongoing support. Seriously.

Am I the only one who feels this way?  Is everyone else psyched about the new app and  machine learning and I’m just scared of change and impatient?? Don’t get me wrong, the tension board is an ingenious training tool and the holds are some of the best on the market for training. There has clearly been a lot of thought and hard work put into this app and the new tools associated with it. Unfortunately, it was implemented abruptly, in a way that really screwed over people who had invested heavily in an expensive training tool. If I could make a suggestion, I think bringing back the old app and offering the machine learning app as a separate app entirely would solve about 99% of these problems. 

Sorry for the rant. Just frustrated.
How can I improve at home as a beginner with limited time? I’ve been climbing for about 6 months and I can reliably climb 6A routes.

I love the sport but I can only get to the climbing wall once a week reliably. I want to be able to have the best sessions I can when I get to the wall but once a week makes progress slower. 

My forearms get tired quickly, my grip strength obviously needs to improve, and my strength isn’t at the point I can do a muscle up. I take frequent breaks and warm up to help with the forearm fatigue and I have been focusing on dips and pull ups at home.

The guy that runs my climbing gym was giving me some pointers and we got talking about this. He recommended technique tutorials and “additional training” but we didn’t have time to get into any specifics.
What single factor has made the biggest difference for your climbing progression? As the title says: in hindsight, what has made the biggest difference for your climbing progression in your experience?
Let's talk about how we discuss hangboarding for newer climbers. Edit: Thanks for the discussion guys, but let me clarify; this is not trying to tell people that the advice they give is wrong. This is not me trying to tell people how to train, or that beginners *aren't* better off just climbing. It is me voicing my opinion on the quality of advice given at times by those who are echoing what they have heard on this subreddit before. Also note this is in reference to people who have been climbing over a year. If you have been climbing for 6 months as I mention IN the post, this may not apply to that situation.
  
Let me preface this with the fact that as we all know, climbing is a skill sport. If you have been climbing for 3 months, 2 times a week then it's unlikely that hangboarding is the low hanging fruit you are looking for to improve.  
  
However, for a community that is dedicated to improvement I am shocked to see how anti-hangboarding many users can be. I see this in the language used and the advice given to people.  
  
**The Elephant In the Room** - *"Don't hangboard until you've climbed for x years, or you will get injured. Tendons take longer to develop than muscles!"*  
  
All of us have likely heard this thrown around at some point and I have a feeling many who spout it never think about *why* they are saying it. To put it bluntly hangboarding is far less likely to cause injury when programmed well (we'll get to this) than hard climbing. In my experience climbers are far more likely to get an injury when climbing on hard crimps, either from foot slips and dynamic catches that shock load the tendons. In contrast hangboarding is a *controlled load*. The intensity of any hangboard session is completely modular and therefore easy to adjust for an individual.    
  
**Hangboarding Can Reduce Injury**   

I mainly apply this to the the use of grips that aren't our "preferred" ones. At some point, even if you are the strongest half-crimper known to mankind you are likely going to have to latch a hold in a 3 finger drag position. If you have never done this before through prior training how would you begin to develop the strength? Many would say a base of climbing would be the best way and for the most part I would agree. However, the recruitment and strength gained in those positions on a hangboard are once again **far** more controlled that climbing! This is of course less of a concern to newer climbers, but it's worth mentioning. The concept still applies to beginners: How do we expect them to get strong in the positions they need to be in safely otherwise?  
  
This is also true for any climber who is transitioning to the outdoors. The features of rock do not always lend themselves to nice even edges, so getting strong in multiple positions would be beneficial for all climbers, not just beginners!

**Modern Climbing Gyms Do Not Set Us Up For Success**

If you climb at a grease cave of a climbing gym them your experiences will vary wildly to a lot of new climbers. Modern style gyms often have circuits that have specific hold types for each grade (at least where I am based). At these types of gyms there is a distinct lack of small holds until a certain "level" is reached. What this means is that frequently new climbers hit this wall where they simply cannot move on to harder boulders to improve without having the requisite finger strength. This creates a frustrating roadblock for these climbers, where more experienced (read: stronger) climbers will tell them,   
*"It's just technique"*  
I'm guilty of it, you're guilty of it. However I know this is often not the case. This brings me to the next point of why I think we should change how we talk about hangboarding. 

**It Is Really Hard To Climb Well When You're Barely Hanging On**

When I was climbing at these gyms, and reaching a point where I believed I needed more finger strength I had this pushback. People who I had then looked up to condescendingly spewed this same rhetoric, and for a while I believed them. However, after one cycle of max hangs I noticed a *huge* difference in how comfortable I was finding the positions on climbs with smaller holds. Nowadays I climb much harder than these people ever have, and that's partially because I decided to ignore their advice and go with my gut. Unsurprisingly when you're not barely clinging to the wall you have a greater opportunity to feel out and learn the best positions for any particular climb.

**Please note**: that this is all in the context of a properly laid out hangboarding routine, with climbing volume/load adjusted. There is an extreme wealth of information of how to do this (see Dave Macleod, Eva Lopez, Will Anglin's Hangboarding: A Way, Lattice Training). I'm of the belief that just as the "just climb more" is a cop out answer for how beginners should train for climbing. I think it's an equally shitty answer to just say "you will get injured if you haven't met (arbitrary time target) climbed!". We are a community focused on improvement. Do you guys truly think that this is an acceptable answer to be throwing out to people, with minimal explanation?  
  
This may have ended up being a bit more ramble-y but the more I see this pop up here the more I wanted to write something. What do you guys think, should we be change how the community approaches this advice? I would love to hear your thoughts.
Hangboard + Finger Roll Protocal for Synovitis Rehab? I’ve been struggling with synovitis in various knuckles for over a year and I’m now pretty committed to a hangboard and finger roll rehab schedule in an attempt to treat it after coming across [this article from Steven Low.](https://stevenlow.org/beating-climbing-injuries-pip-synovitis/). For the past month I’ve just been doing the following about 2-3 times per week. 

8 x 10 second 4 finger open hand hangs, with 2 minute rests on largest edge of a beastmaker1000 (though since I’m doing open hand, only a single pad is in contact with the board). 

30 reps, 5 sets of finger rolls with a standard 45lb bar. 

My main question is, now that I can comfortably do this routine should I start transitioning to a smaller edge or start adding weight to the hangboarding and finger rolls? Or should I continue to keep things easy until the synovitis has hopefully healed? Not sure which one is better for this type of rehab. Any insight here or any other suggestions are hugely appreciated!
Height vs Weight Graphs Based on Some of the Best Climbers in the World I am currently trying to train myself to become a data scientist. I decided this was a good practice problem to go through. 

I've found that many climbers obsess over the "correct" weight for their height. I decided the easiest way to help people avoid losing too much weight and find a healthy balanced weight is to compile the info from professional climbers.

The info was collected from Wikipedia using IFSC pages leading to climber wiki pages. Not all climbers are included as some had incomplete data. I found the linear fit of the data and then matched the slope to the points furthest away on the higher and lower side of the spread. 

Keep in mind, climbers are on the lighter side of professional athletes so this should not be used as measure of "healthy" weight. This is simply meant to show where professional climbers fall.

Here is the data for both men and women:

Do you have a “lifetime” goal boulder or route? Is there a particular climb that you’re especially inspired by but not realistically training for right now? Maybe something that’s like 5 v-grades or a few numbers harder than you’ve ever sent, but it would be amazing to do one day? Or maybe seeing a video of some crazy climb is what got you inspired to train in the first place? 

Just curious about what those climbs might be! It’s not realistic for me to even think about, but I think [Jade](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSAK6UsLY0b/?utm_medium=copy_link) is an especially beautiful boulder. Also, as a frequent RRG climber who’s stood below it in awe, I’d love to do Zookeeper one day.

If you’ve got any wild goal routes, please share—I wanna be inspired!
Twelve years to 12a I’ve read a few posts from people on /r/climbharder where it’s a person’s first year climbing and they’re plateauing at V4 or V5 and want to break into V10 and it’s a very different journey than my own. I wanted to share a little on a longer path to 12a that’s still ongoing. TL:DR at the bottom.      





I’m sitting listening to Mark Twight’s podcast this morning (Episode 173 specifically around the 82 minute mark) and they’re discussing fitness and workouts. Specifically, how an ultra-runner trains for his race, or how Usain Bolt trained to set his world record 100M times. Often, we get to see the training regime for one training cycle, but not the years and years of effort that went into building up the athlete to that point.      





I’ve climbed for 12 years now. Having recently sent my first 5.12a at 37, the podcast’s message caused me to reflect on how the work I’d done in the last year was what got me to climb 12a, but it was the work I’d done in the last decade that allowed me to do the work I did this year.      





From 13 to 25, it’s safe to say I did little to no physical activity. I’d played hockey as a kid, so I always had this internal picture of being an athlete. I was not. When I quit at 12, I didn’t replace it with anything. I’m lucky I wasn’t inclined to overeat, or I’d likely have been very overweight when I finally got started.      





So basically, blank slate at 25, I weighed roughly 145 lbs. I’d never set foot in a gym, maybe I’d gone to a birthday party once at a climbing gym. I did this five days a week training program I’d found on the internet for 5-weeks with my first ever fitness membership. Through this, I learned how to do compound lifts. A friend invited me to go climbing at the gym, and we bouldered for a while and I didn’t think much of it. Months later, I was telling another friend about it and he suggested we go sometime. That turned into us eventually buying gear, annual climbing passes, and going once or twice a week.      





I spent a year or two just messing around both strength training and climbing. I still remember “sending” my first gym 5.10- on toprope. It had felt impossible at the time, so to finish it without weighting the rope was a big achievement personally. As time went on, my friend lost interest in climbing, but I met a girl, took her climbing and she loved it far more than I ever did, or still do. She’s become much more to me, and over the next few years we got tons of mileage at the climbing gym, eventually taking a course there to learn to climb outside and gradually got stronger. The first routes I’ve got recorded in sendage are some 5.9’s and 10a’s in 2015, so it took probably 5 years from the time I started climbing to first getting outside and leading.      





It’s hard to overstate how much this woman being a part of my life has influenced my climbing. There are two personality traits that I think define me more than anything else. A 1st percentile (low end) score in conscientiousness. A saying that resonates with me is “You’d better be efficient, because you’re going to have trouble being diligent enough to see anything through.” The other piece is a strong tendency towards introversion. The same formative experiences that lead me to change my life at 25, also had me circle the wagons internally. I’ve got my girlfriend, about 5 acquaintances I’ll play games with every couple months, or go skiing with once a season, and that’s me. A hard introvert – I don’t ask other people to do things. I don’t get lonely, but the cost is I’m also content to do nothing but read, or play games, or watch TV. If I didn’t have a lover of climbing wanting to get out 3 or 4 times a week I might be back to my 13 year old self doing very little.       





I got stronger in the gym and that helped me move up to sending my first 5.11’s outside in 2016, but from there plateau’d hard. I honestly disliked climbing outside. Leading scared me deeply. Partly because the movement felt so precarious, partly because of inconsistency in my climbing/training and a massive part of it was working in an awful stressful industry that was slowly driving me insane.       





Despite that in 2018 I sent my first 11b, and 11c, but it was taking a toll. Work had reached a breaking point and I broke.       





2019 I barely climbed at all.        





And I realized I missed it.       





I found a new job.       





And things got better.        





Enter: Covid. I was lucky. My new job was largely unaffected by covid. I also had a near complete home gym setup. The climbing gym was open sporadically, and when it was, we went with more consistency that ever before in my life. My girlfriend’s enthusiasm for climbing has never waned, and she pulled me forward. 2020 was a great building block outdoor season just getting comfortable on rock. The movement, the feel, everything, but I wasn’t pushing grades. It was a season of 11a and below.         





As it tapered into the fall and we got inside. On the plastic, I sent my first 5.12a, then 5.12a/b, several more 5.12a’s, a 5.12b, and a 5.12c. I was working a slabby 5.13a on toprope and the moves were going. It felt like another world. But then injured a finger, and covid shut everything down around December.       





Shifted back to weight-lifting while babying my finger injury. Did the garage-gym competition and finished with some lifetime PR’s for a total of 865 lbs in May 2021. Gave myself golfer’s elbow. (learning more lessons about injury and management) – Worked hard with my physiotherapist and massage therapist to continue activity in an intelligent way. Climbed outside a lot when it was nice out. Took down an 11c early in the season after 4 days of effort. Felt good on it, confident. Started putting up the draws for my girlfriend’s projects. 11c, 12a, another 11c. I was climbing bolt-to-bolt on these routes, but felt calm and technically sound. Had both my feet and one hand blow while well above my last bolt on another 12a project and my internal monologue was a matter-of-fact “well this isn’t good”. I held the jug one handed, re-established my feet, fired in the draw, made the clip, took a take to settle myself down and realized my heartrate hadn’t really elevated. It was a confidence I didn’t recognize.         





I’d made 1 attempt at a 12a send early in the season and felt completely shut down on it. Even though I’d been putting draws up bolt to bolt on 3 different 12’s, I still didn’t see myself as a climber who could do this. But I got in the arena, picked a day, and got back on it.         





That day I fell off 2 moves into the crux, then 3. Came back 2 days later and fell 5 moves into the crux, then on the 6th move when I thought it was over. Heartbreaker. Came back again. Had a massive multi-generational family politely ask if they could watch, and was surprised to hear an internal voice that was happy to have an audience. Made it 8 moves into the crux, fell while reaching for the final jug rail. Big whipper. Good show.           





The end feels anti-climatic. Like it was inevitable. A big whipper that once would have shaken me and left me unfit to climb for the rest of the day, or even the week didn’t register. I did some minor skin maintenance, rested for 20 minutes and sent it. I feel more emotional now reflecting on it than I did in the moment.          





In the days since, I’ve put the draws up on my girlfriends (far harder in my opinion) 12a project several times bolt to bolt, and she finally sent it. There’s plenty of days left in the season, but for me I don’t know where to go from here. Is it time for another project? Do I just enjoy being out as many days as we can before fall rolls in? 12a felt like a landmark grade for so long, and it’s brought with it, contentment. Still, I’m looking forward to walking a little further.         





TL:DR I don’t have the internal drive to make massive short term advancements, then compound on them to be exceptional. But I can be better than I was yesterday. I am forever grateful to have the right person/partner that is patient with me, and shouts back down the path to keep going. The work I did in the last year was what got me to climb 12a, but it was the work I’d done in the last decade that allowed me to do the work I did this year. Meandering towards harder grades is a path. It’s simply a longer path. It has allowed me to achieve something I thought was beyond me, by staying with the effort over a longer period of time to overcome my own temperament.
Anyone here crushing V10+ and started late 20s/early 30s? Started at 28 a couple years ago and I'm currently at a v5/v6 level. Sad that I didn't start climbing at an earlier age. So much lost time and potential... anyway, just wondering how common (or uncommon) it is for climbers that got late starts to still hit v- double digits within their lifetimes. How much of it is try hard vs genetics? I've already sustained a few minor injuries that have been slowing my progress and I can only imagine these things get worse as we age.
Beginner/noob: if the next grade level feels hard/impossible, do you train on lower grades on grind the next grade? I'm 30, 1m88, 78kg and climbing for a year and a half (gym closed a lot tough due to covid).

I'm currently climbing V4, and I pretty much can do every V4 boulder my gym sets. If a new one is put up, I can either onsight it, or do it after a couple of tries.
The logical move would be to proceed to V5, like I have done with all other grades, but...
V5 feels extremely hard to me in terms of upper body strenght and finger strength, to the point where I barely can start the routes at that level. I feel like I'm in a really awkward space between grades.

I wonder what the best way would be for me to break through this mini-plateau: 

* Do I climb V4 a lot to improve my technique, and condition muscles/tendons/etc... and try to get stronger that way?

* Do I tryhard the V5 grade, hoping I get stronger and improve my technique by doing the stuff I feel too weak for over and over again?

* Do I start to incorporate some strength/finger-strength training? (most people of this sub seem to advocate the "just climb" mantra for people at my grade tough)

Thanks!
Is there such a thing as resting too long on a route? I've heard it said by commentators for lead climbing that you shouldn't stay in a resting position for too long, but I don't understand why that would be the case and they didn't offer an explanation for their assertion.

The way I see it:

* You can only rest if the position demands a low percentage of your maximum strength, I think at least below 50%. If it's too hard, you're getting more fatigued over time, not less, so you're on a timer and it's better to move on hoping to find a better position.
* If you're resting, it means your pump is decreasing over time and your breathing and heart rate become more calm.
* If you rest longer you recover more, until you asymptotically reach equilibrium. Similar to how you can't charge a battery more than 100%.
* So what could possibly be bad about staying until equilibrium, other than you're doing a competition and you're worried about the time limit? Most lead competitors shouldn't worry about speed and keeping rests short because they fall before their timer counts down to zero.
Fellow runner/climbers - how do you have enough energy after runs to climb well? Even with a few hours of rest, I still feel low energy and lethargic. Is this just a matter of training harder at both to be able to manage the work load? Going for a run in the morning almost always means I feel kinda blah and slow when I climb later. I run a few miles, up to 6 or 7, and boulder mainly. Any tips with nutrition or something? I drink lots of coffee which helps.
What injury prevention exercises can I do to help with a tweaky finger I’ve had tweaky fingers for a while, specially my left middle finger has been  previously injured and whenever I’m hangbaording for a while or climbing on  super crimpy routes I sometimes feel strain on this finger. What exercises can I do to make it less tweaky?

Edit: the reason it’s tweaky is a minor growth plate fracture when I was 14 ( 18 now ) nothing is misaligned thankfully
Are there any other non-Olympic mere mortals bouldering/sport climbing with a fused back? Any specific advice how to avoid injuries?
Designed a new Training plan to push my grade, any criticism is very welcome so, for context, I currently project 7a routes and can send 6c in 2/3 tries. I don't really boulder much but the gym I go to only has boulder walls so I'm fairly obbligated. I wanted to take my training up a notch to hit 7b/7c next year and be able to comfortably climb 7a.

I'm in the youth team at my local gym and train there 3 days a week so I've based everything around that. If I plan to go climbing I'll just skip a session or take an extra rest day so yeah.

Any and all critiscm is welcome, idk if it's jtoo much or too little

Edit: to clarify the "gym training " are the days I go indoor bouldering, training circuits  etc where I'm  getting most of my climbing  volume.
The thing What is one thing you did or changed in your training or just everyday lifestyle that made the most significant difference in your climbing 

Example- getting 8 hours of sleep, eating more or less meat could be whatever
Training flexibility So I've only been climbing for about a year. I was never extremely flexible. It's hands down my biggest block when it comes to more technical climbs and definitely a huge stop on slabs.

I started doing yoga about 8 months ago, but I'll be honest, I hate it. It has helped a lot, but it has also been demoralizing, because it showed a huge weakness in my hips. I guess they sit weird in the sockets, so the mobility in opening my hips is crap.

So, I guess I have two questions. Is training flexibility on the wall an option? If yes, how? And has anyone else discovered that their hips suck as well? How do you deal with it?
Water's effect on climbing performance and recovery I feel like water's effect on climbing performance and recovery isn't discussed nearly enough in the climbing community. I've only just started looking into this and already seeing the huge impact being properly hydrated has on general sport performance.

Personally, I've always struggled to drink enough water. On a climbing day I'll drink 1-1.5L, and on rest days I can drink as little as 500ml. I never really get a dry mouth from being dehydrated so a large majority of the time I just forget, and also lack motivation in general to improve on this, but hoping by learning more on it's effects this might change.

On the journey of trying to better myself as an athlete, general curiosity, and to educate the climbing community I've got a few questions on this topic:

1. How much of an effect does water have on your performance/recovery?
2. How do you calculate how much water you should be drinking on climbing days vs rest days?
3. What's your personal experience with water and climbing performance/recovery?

Feel free to add anything else interesting about this topic you may have. Thank you to everybody who contributes to this thread.
Bechtel is the realest MF. From the Sept newsletter. Hello and welcome to our September newsletter,


Preparation for a sport is doing hard work. It can be physically hard, it can be hard to schedule, and it can be emotionally hard to work on things you’d rather not, but it all ends up hard at some point. The trap is divergence. The trap is when we convince ourselves that more of the stuff we’re good at is the solution. That doing five laps on a wired route is more useful than spending time building much needed shoulder stability. The trap is when we dive too deep into looking for optimal solutions rather than putting our heads down and doing the work.

I’ve written before about our focus on the “last” 10% of performance that is so interesting and sexy. Things like quasi-isometrics, nutrient timing, supplementation, wearing two different shoes, and the like. This is interesting stuff, and seems so much more specific to performance than going to bed by 10, drinking 3 liters of water a day, eating vegetables, and getting enough protein. Doing the Moonboard benchmarks is super entertaining, but for most of us, just bouldering, at all, a couple of days a week, for most of the year, is the big key. 


 
The study of the sport is not the sport. 


Learning about how hypertrophy works (to this day no one really knows what causes our muscles to grow) is interesting, but it doesn’t make them grow. Sorting out the science on aerobic versus anaerobic capacity and power can be confusing and exciting all at the same time, but it doesn’t change the fact that you do still need to go to the gym and train. We don’t really need to know how it works to make it work for us.

This brings us to the “black box.” As much as it is useful to try and understand what happens in the body when we are training, it’s academic. As long as we know what to do in training (input for the black box), we can expect a result on the back end (output from the black box). 

I’m not saying that trying to understand the processes is a waste of time, I’m just saying that worrying too much about understanding before acting is probably taking away from some valuable training time. We don’t need to understand metabolism in order to eat. We don’t need to know the details of aerobic adaptations in order to know how to improve them. We don’t need to know how our phones process and store information in order to use them.


 
Most of the time, we just need to work. 


Last month, we gathered all of the Climb Strong coaching team for a weekend of education and climbing. During one of the discussions, AJ Sobrilsky voiced his frustration over his athletes’ need to “feel it” each session. Unless we feel power decline, finger strength wane, or get so pumped we can’t close our hands, we must not have trained hard enough. We get the message, from friends, YouTube, and old Rocky movies, that we need to be crushed by training at all times, or it’s not training. 

Sure, once in a while, your training will leave you sore, but we have to remember the goal: improved performance. If training is not producing higher levels of strength, longer intervals, or bigger links, it’s not working...no matter how sore it makes us. It’s not what happened today, but what happened this month that matters. One workout is a trauma, ten workouts are a stimulus. The trick is to give yourself the time to progress, to allow yourself to adapt, and to save your “war face” for the crag. Ten sessions of maybe not optimal exercises, and maybe leaving the gym with some fuel left in the tank. It’s not much to ask, but most of us can’t do it.
Route 4x4s are a session we recommend to help climbers build low-end endurance. They are tedious and the climbing feels pretty easy. For a 5.12a climber (one who can send that grade in one session - a few tries at most), we would probably recommend starting this workout at about the 5.10a level. Clearly, this is easy for this person, but the session consists of doing one pitch of 10a, then immediately toproping it 3 times. The climber would then rest for 12-15 minutes, maybe while a partner does the same 4 laps, then repeat the whole thing three more times.

The laps feel too easy. In order to adapt properly to primarily aerobic fueling and building all-day capacity, though, they need to be easy. More times than I can count, I’ve had people try the session, increase the difficulty mid-session (to, say, 11b) get totally smashed by it and “feel” like it “worked.” Rarely have I had an athlete do this workout nine more sessions. Too tedious. It is training, not entertainment. Way before even the fifth session, most of them will have listened to another interview on The Nugget and been inspired to go another direction. Remember, getting endurance is boring, having it is not.


 
You can’t buy it.


One of the things I love about performance is that you can’t buy it. Sure, you can hire help, can take drugs, can build a team of therapists and dietitians, but you still have to go boulder to get better at bouldering. There’s no faking it either. Hang out at a Salt Lake City coffee shop on a Saturday morning and you’re bound to see a guy ride up in an expensive kit on a $10k road bike, and there’s no telling whether he is a pro or just rode down for coffee. Even when he’s out riding with a group of friends, it’s hard for the casual observer to tell how good this person really is. At the crag, thank the gods, there is no pretending. You have it or you don’t. Your excuses are so terribly transparent that you might as well swallow them all. You should have trained harder. Should have climbed more. It doesn’t matter how nice your gear looks.
I have been thinking a lot about how people tend to think they are “doing everything right” in their training, and if, by any chance, they are not, it’s just because of ____ (insert external factor such as gym open times, demanding job, being a great family man). It’s hard to swallow that you might have just been doing it wrong, as I did when I dedicated 6 months of my life to building my power endurance back in the early 2000s. And no, it didn’t work. I wrote a book about that training. Don’t buy it.
Stepping back and seeing that it didn’t work is progress. Assigning no judgement or ego to it is additional progress. Taking the information from that training phase and applying it to the next is science. Learn from yesterday’s mistakes. Fix them. Don’t fall into the same pattern. I sound like Dr. Phil, but it’s true; our habits can make or break us. 
In this way, inspiration and motivation are our enemies. Yes, I want you to be motivated to train first thing every day, but I don’t want you to plan out a year that you can’t possibly execute. Where you are is where you’re starting. It’s amazing to me the number of people who will set a goal of climbing Moonlight Buttress in Zion (a climb that sports a half-dozen pitches of 5.12)  later this year, not having redpointed a half dozen 5.12s in the past year. 
Good goals inspire, but the very best represent a small step forward in daily practices that add up to a “leveling up” over 4 or 6 or 12 months. Motivation will betray you when you need it most. 
 
A practice of going just one better than last year is a solid plan.
I have a spreadsheet where I track each month’s training numbers. I put down training type and time, climbing days, number of pitches and the grades of those sends. I put down average bodyweight and my testing numbers for that month. I can go back easily and look at the months with my hardest climbing ever, and then see how many climbing and training days led up to those performances. Where I was strength-wise. What my body weight was.
It then becomes very easy to plan the weeks of training leading up to a trip or attempt at a limit-level send. I don’t need to do 8 pitches per day, I just need to do about what I did last time. I need to aim for similar volume and intensity, and the rest is just putting in the time on the rock. Success leaves tracks.
The hardest thing I do in my own training (and in my life) is to look at what I might be doing wrong and aim to correct it. Shortcuts are attractive. I’d love a 4-week fix to a problem—any problem. I’d love to throw money at a problem and have it fixed. Maybe the best thing about climbing is that it doesn’t allow for pretending. Time to saddle up for another season of working harder than we thought we’d have to.

Full body 3x a week, or push-pull-legs to synergize with Climbing? I finally have access to both a climbing gym and weight gym, I'm trying to decide how I should manage Climbing and lifting. I know for raw climbing performance just doing deadlifts and some push exercises is probably all you need outside of climbing workouts- but I enjoy a full workout split and find it has negligible consequences on my climbing.



I climb three days a week Monday Wednesday Friday. Doing a full body split would give me more full rest days, but I'd end up in the gym for 4+ hours and would probably get fatigued on any later workouts. Push pull legs would only give me one true rest day, so I'm worried about CNS fatigue. The only other issue is I would be doing deadlifts after or before Climbing days, which might not give my forearms proper rest.
Do any weightlifting climbers have any thoughts?
Progressing past V10, how did you do it? A dream milestone for a lot of people is to reach V10. In font grades this would be 8A(V11) but since most people here use the V-Grade i'll go with V10. But it's not an end all be all goal, once you get there you'd naturally still want to progress. But it's getting harder and harder to get better.

To the people who have reached V10 and pushed past it, how did you do it? Im not only looking for people well into the double digits like V13+, V11 or V12 also counts as pushing past V10 ofcourse. Also it's not only specificaly about V10, but around that level. It could also be you had a blockade at V8/9 and steam rolled through once you passed it or where stuck at V11 before you pushed further. I know my target audience is small but hopefully there will still be some people who can share their insights.

Not a lot of people are even hovering around the V10 grade ofcourse to which this advice would directly apply but even if that's not your level there is probably still a lot that can be learned, though be wary that at different levels it could be better to focus on different things.

Now a bit more specific, what was your experience? Did you have to climb more than you used to, or mayble less? Or climb less and train more, or the other way around. What kind of training worked for you to get to the next level. Did your mindset or focus change. Was there any weakness that you had to adress, or just play more into your strengths. Maybe you had to put more thought in non climbing things like cleaning up your diet or sleeping more. Or you had to get better at the projecting game, with better tactics and awareness of conditions. Did you have to sacrifice other things for climbing. Was there anything you would have done different in hindsight? Or also possible ofcourse, were you still progressing without changing anything and you got better by just doing what you where doing before. I want to hear it all.

Im looking foreward to the replies and insights.
One Theory of Climbing Ability Based on [this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/pijufm/progressing_past_v10_how_did_you_do_it/), I thought I'd just write up one of the general heuristics I use to think about my climbing performance. I've also used this idea for kids I've coached in the past. It might be obvious to some of you, it may be novel to others, but I figure since there may be some people out there who benefit from this, why not put it out there. It's Labor Day, what else am I going to do lol.

I like to think about my climbing as a polygon on a multi-axis. Honestly, I stole this model from Pokemon - I'm not ashamed to admit that. As you improve certain aspects of your climbing, the overall area of your climbing polygon will increase. The total area of the polygon is an approximation for your ability. Here is an example:

https://preview.redd.it/do7c635l8xl71.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc168adc41639770bd0aedbd7f22e80e3a7f8c25

The axes are the different aspects of your climbing. There's four climbers I've drawn for discussion:

* Black dotted line: a perfectly well-rounded climber. A good way to think about this would be the climber who can do every possible climb at a given grade. This climber almost certainly doesn't exist, but is a useful benchmark to anchor performance to when drawing your own, to establish relative strengths and weaknesses.
* Green line: an example crimp master. Not particularly strong, not very good at reading routes or using their body well, but has ridiculously strong fingers and can try really stupid hard.
* Silver line: this is my own climbing. Two years ago, I had much stronger fingers and was able to hang 6mm edges with 40 pounds of extra weight, but I had lower body awareness and strength. Over the past year, I've worked on my weaknesses and improved my lifestyle for climbing, but my fingers definitely are not as strong as they were previously. Overall I think I'm still a better climber because I'm more well-rounded and less specialized.
* Red line: this is my estimation of a typical mid-20s male starting out on climbing. Strong, probably has decent fitness and/or a decent lifestyle, but low sport-specific attributes: body awareness, mobility, finger strength, etc. This climber could double down on strength - and we see a lot of people here posting for feedback on the strength plan they hope will get them through their v4 plateau - or they can look elsewhere.

**Things this model is not**:

* Exhaustive: you can distinguish the multiple aspects of climbing more finely or more broadly, and this may be too many / too few axes. For example, I considered making core strength its own axis but just mentally bucketed it under the broad "strength" axis. You could also make body awareness and route reading a single axis, maybe because route reading is too specific to warrant its own axis. I wouldn't argue with any objections like that.
* Discipline-agnostic: boulderers would obviously have different axes from ice climbers. I think that would be readily obvious, but wanted to explicitly say that.

**Things this model is:**

* Illustrative of climbing as a multifaceted sport
* Useful in demonstrating multiple pathways to success: if total surface area = ability, you can think of any number of combinations of points on the axes that would equal the same area. For any given polygon, you can also find multiple ways forward. You can also start thinking about how spiking on any one single axis may not make up for deficiencies elsewhere. If I can deadhang 20mm with 1 arm, but someone who cannot do that still climbs harder than me, I need to look to other dimensions of climbing to begin understanding why.
* Provides guidance for climbers to articulate their relative strengths and weaknesses, regardless of ability

**Ways this model can be improved:**

* Axes are likely dependent on some aspects more than others; axes may not need to be equidistant. I don't really do math anymore so very open to discussing that more.
* There's a limit to how far one can push a given strength, and the returns for doubling down on a single aspect will be limited at some point. By my estimation, mathematically you can keep driving the surface area of a polygon up in a somewhat linear fashion by continuing to push the corner out, but intuitively I think there's likely diminishing returns to specialization as an athlete. I'm not smart enough to know how to illustrate that though.

Happy to discuss if anyone finds this interesting or objectionable.
Any long term finger health strategies for heavier climbers? I’m a larger climber currently sitting at around 6’5, 220lbs. I’m probably going to be on the heavier side for the next year to 18 months or so as I’ve been spending a lot of time developing my lower body (physical therapy &amp; separate strength goals unrelated to climbing performance, I understand it’s completely counterintuitive). I would still like to at minimum maintain my current ability level (5.12ish, v7ish) over this bulking period. The only thing that really feels like it’s holding me back is my finger tendon integrity. Pretty much all of my fingers hurt or feel sore after every session, specifically the foremost joints in my index and pinky fingers that hurt when I flex them back, like you would in a crimping position.

Are there any heavier performance climbers out there with a good finger health routine, or maybe a checklist of things to do to make sure I’m not overexerting, which I clearly must be. Really I just climb most days because I get bored but I want to be able to do this at a relatively high level for a long time with fingers that feel healthy and strong, so I’m willing to make some adjustments.
Strategies for developing and maintaining a resilient head game? **TL;DR:** Headgame weak. Commitment issues on rope, irrational fears take hold. Also lose headgame with nearly any kind of break from sport/trad climbing. How to build strong headgame and maintain said headgame during breaks from climbing?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been climbing/bouldering for \~3 years, with a hefty break during the start of the pandemic. \~V6-8ish/5.12ish climber.

I have a weak headgame. I have been able to climb a lot of sport, take a lot of falls, try hard, etc, and my head game becomes OK but not great. For whatever reason, even at my strongest headgame, I would still have commitment issues at my limit or when things aren't "perfect" (any size ledge below me, not my style, etc), and I would still be stopped by irrational fears (foot near but not behind rope, runouts with safe falls, imagining the rope dragging across the rock and being cut, etc) in a lot of attempts on stuff that I would consider within my abilities.

Something I also struggle with is maintaining whatever progress I have made with my headgame. If I take a week or more off, my headgame practically evaporates. I am on a deload week in the 4321 protocol, and due to the periodization, I haven't been on a rope in a month and a half. I went to Penitente Canyon this weekend and while the warm up (5.9 with big, positive pockets) felt OK, I was still really nervous. We went over to a thin slab route that goes at \~5.11- after that and I just couldn't commit to anything without barely trying, getting scared, taking, and repeat until I just force myself to go due to embarrassment/time. I will concede that the climbing at Penitente is definitely more bold than I'm used to, even during times when my headgame wasn't so weak.

I'm looking to work on this because I am holding myself back and it's becoming not fun, and that's just not cool. Taking falls helps, but only to a point, and that point is not very far. What strategies do you use to develop and maintain a strong headgame, even when you're not constantly climbing on a rope? Is there any advice you can give to someone facing these kinds of issues? Thanks and happy sending
People with wrist pain and/or have a TFCC problem. Do you crimp the correct way? I have a theory that people with wrist pain and/or TFCC (myself included) crimp incorrectly. Since I don't engage the ulnar side of my wrist (lack of pinky during crimps) I never really developed ulnar side wrist stabilization and pinky strength.

Difficult crimps make me resort to the three-finger drag and always resulted in me not using my pinkys as a bad habit.

Controlling the swing So I am a fairly experienced climber, but mainly in rope climbing. I have been trying to boulder more lately to get my strength up. I have noticed a lot of the overhanging problems I do(including some V3 moonboard problems) my feet swing out really hard. I know some swing out is expected, but I'm starting to feel like a complete noob with how much I swing out. What can I do to better control this? Is this a core thing that can be fixed with a bit more ab training? Or are there climbing exercises I can do that will help?

Thanks for the great advice guys:)
What helps you recover fingers quicker on rest days? Hi,

I noticed that Crimpd app has a section called Regeneration which they recommend on rest days for recovery. Some exercises they mention - ARC Sessions, 3 sets of 5 mins on really easy climbing 3 mins off, deadhang repeaters @ 30%.

What works for you on rest days (specifically for fingers but overall advice works too)? Do you just rest completely? Or do some exercises / light climbing - ARC, light hangboarding, finger rolls, something else? 

How should I think about resting? 

Thanks for your help!
Are 90's Bouldering Gyms Cool Again? I recently saw this older [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMs3sHLjRwM) on Magnus' channel and I thought it was super interesting on so many levels because it really challenged what a "modern" gym looks like and my expectations around a climbing gym.   


Here are some observations that I made:  


* Problems are taped instead of color matched holds - leads to a bunch more problem variations but also potential confusion for newer climbers? 
*  Small sized gym - counter to gyms with a lot of features, yoga rooms, weight rooms, party rooms, etc. 
* Spray wall instead of set problems - Would this be intimidating to new comers? I am often curious if a spray wall gives total freedom to experienced climbers but really limits newer climbers because they don't have rolodex of different movement they can explore. 
* Doesn't seem to change holds often - In one point of the video, Magnus shared that he liked how the holds were not new and quite worn in challenging strength rather than relying on friction. This is so counter to my own expectation of expecting nice clean, and shiny holds being on a constant reset schedule 

What are your own thoughts on this?  I would be curious your thoughts on if you would want to climb at a gym like that versus a larger modern gym.
Describe your perfect limit bouldering session I'm curious how other people do it in terms of grade of climbs they pull from, how many moves, how many attempts, rest, etc

*edit* 

What would you say is an ideal success to failure ratio for limit bouldering?
Let's talk about the mechanism of Pogo aka the Moonkick Let me preface by saying that it's NOT a skill you need in order to climb hard. Its applications are rare and if you're routesetter you know it's very difficult to force a Pogo. However, it's a wonderful skill to have in your tool box and it teaches you how to use momentum, move off awkward/off-balanced positions and climb more dynamically.

First thing first, there are a lot of misconceptions regarding what is a Pogo. In this [article](https://frictionlabs.com/blog/connors-world-the-secret-to-pogoing) from Frictionlabs it defines Pogo as a move that *"propels your body upwards using momentum generated from the swinging movement of one of your legs"*. In this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijX7tZrGXUs) from Tomoa Narasaki (who's a master of this technique btw), he describes the Pogo as a *"jumping move using centrifugal force created by the swinging leg."*

This definition only half true in my opinion. While the swinging leg does generate some momentum, the power is still predominantly coming from the other leg pushing off the foothold. It's similar to if you were to do a box jump, you could swing your arms up to generate some upward momentum but your legs are still doing majority of the work.

So what is a Pogo after all? Here's my take on it.

There are a couple of prerequisites that necessitate the use of Pogo.

**1)** the hands holds are bad enough one can't lock off and pull up; if you let go of either hand you'll just fall. This mean the move cannot be done statically.

In other words, one man's Pogo is another (strong) man's regular move.

**2)** there is a singular useful foot hold and it puts you off balance. In physic words, your center of gravity (COG) is NOT directly over the foot hold no matter how hard you twist your hips. This is crucial because otherwise you could simply do a regular dyno and go straight up. 

**It's very difficult to jump while off-balanced.**

Try it.  Attempt a vertical jump while leaning back or sideways and tell me how it feels.

This is why when you do a step up dyno, you rock the hip over first before you explode so that your COG is directly over your foot. This is why when you do a regularly dyno, you pull yourself in first;

**And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why you kick your leg back before you Pogo; it creates a momentary shift of COG over the foot in contact with the wall and allows you to exert maximum amount of power into the foothold.**

The swinging of the leg in the end is of course important too to propel you even higher. But the problem is most people focus too much on the second swing and ignoring the first swing and pushing off. Hopefully understanding the mechanism helps people learn and execute the move better.

Anyways this is my feeble attempt to explain the mechanism behind the Pogo jump. I write this up after frustratingly searching for an explanation on the internet and came up empty-handed. I could be completely wrong so please let me know if you disagree.
Super Pump? Why? Hey all, forgive me if this has been covered a bunch before, I looked a little but might have just been searching the wrong keywords..

I've had a few sessions over the last couple years that have started out fine and in very short order have ended up with extreme forearm pump. Like whole arm becomes a solid rock for 20 - 45 minutes. It's been pretty painful once but mostly it just doesn't stop. Climbing more only seems to extend the issue and goes without saying I've got a lot less power when this happens.

Seems pretty clear it's a lactic acid buildup but why so extreme? Suggestions on what to do to avoid it? Articles that talk about it?

Mostly interested in what's actually happening and why it's only every so often. 

Thanks for the help.
Moonboard Hold Dimensions - Quality Control? Hi,

So I've been climbing on the Moonboard for about 5 years now, and have noticed that there seems to be quite a bit of variation on the actual size of the hold sets from board-to-board. On the initial moonboard I used, I found there were some problems 4-5 grades below my max that I couldn't touch . . . until I went to another moonboard and realized that some holds were literally 200-300% bigger elsewhere!

I had initially thought this was just a bad pour on the board at my gym (and since Moon Climbing NA no longer produces in the US, that maybe the holds from the UK would be more standardized) - but after being on another few boards around the state, I've found that almost every set has some holds with significant variation. 

In terms of training, not terrible - I can still tell if I'm improving based on the holds and movement on the board I have, but in terms of playing the "game" I get curious about the problems I struggle on now! Does anyone know of where I can find dimensions for hold size, or is this just a dream?
I made a bunch of sample route pyramids. Also some thoughts on what pyramids are good for and ideas about how to use them.
Help me interview a new climber with a background in kung fu (he has iron fingers) So the first time I saw this guy, he was doing a 7a (v6) on rental shoes. He immediately caught my attention, because I've never seen someone with such terrible technique manage to hang on and finish a climb. It was honestly a little bit mind blowing.  


We started talking and turns out he trained kung fu, and specifically trained finger strength for years. He mentioned some exercises like push ups on the fingers (with fingers shaped for 'tiger', 'panther' and 'crane' styles), but I really wonder what else he has been doing and what his training looked like in terms of intensity.  


I haven't trained finger strength (yet), but I know it's a big topic in climbing. So I think it would be very nice for me to interview him. I highly doubt any of the kung fu training drills will translate directly to climbing, but it could still be interesting and we could still learn a thing or two (kung fu has been strengthening fingers for hundreds of years, so despite the lack of scientific background there could still be some lessons in there).  


So, any ideas for interview questions? I'll make a video and post it soon, so he can demonstrate. Thank you for thinking with me on this!
Do you ever stretch before climbing? The morning would be a perfect time to do a flexibility / mobility routine for me (around 9am). But I usually go climbing in the evenings and afraid of getting injured if I go climbing after static stretches. Is it something to worry about or can I do it?
Training for climbing mentor I've been climbing 10 years with some breaks here and there but pretty consistently. I've climbed a handful of 12ds (1 of them 13a), flashed a few 12bs and a 12c and bouldered v6/v7. I've only done 1 proper training cycle when a friend wrote a training plan for me. I've read countless articles and listened to 100s of podcasts so I have a pretty good understanding and theory on the subject but always struggle to stick to my own training unless someone writes it for me.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm 30 and want to break the 8a barrier so I'd like to find a coach that helps me get there and also teaches me how to train my by myself and to how to coach others.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions? I can't afford $150 a month right now but I'm willing to do anything else.
The hard truths - retrospective of 8 years trying hard There was a [great thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/peyh37/climbers_of_reddit_whats_the_best_training_advice/) recently which had a lot of helpful climbing advice and got me thinking. I've been around this sub for ~5 years now and have enjoyed a lot of discussions here; overtime I've noticed that the community here leans towards being newer to climbing hard rather than experienced, and it's wonderful to see so many other stoked climbers.

In those five years I've seen newer climbers here make the same mistakes I did, and time and time again focus all too much on the wrong things. Luckily there's plenty of helpful individuals to the rescue (shoutout /u/justcrimp), but I thought it might be helpful for me (and others) to share some short, curt realities of trying hard.

I'm no genetic mutant, I don't hangboard everyday, I don't pay for training plans, and I work a full time job. In the last 8 years I've taken myself from 5.9 -&gt; 5.13 and V0 -&gt; V11, so while I'm by no means an expert, I think others here can relate to what i've learned in the last 8 years:

---

- There will never be a time when you're "good enough" and don't need to improve upon technique anymore

- Weight training is never a *replacement* for climbing

- That training plan you paid $100+ for probably isn't worth it

- Stop listening to genetic mutants on youtube giving awful advice

- A large portion of pro climbers have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to training for low-mid level goals

- Optimizing your supplements does not excuse an unhealthy diet

- Training doesn't make you stronger, *recovering* from training makes you stronger

- You can't send your project if you aren't trying it

- Nothing makes you better at outdoor climbing than climbing outdoors, consistently

- You probably suck at redpointing, as we all do. Wasted energy everywhere

- Losing weight is not the key to climbing harder

- Hangboarding *is* useful, but not a replacement for climbing

- Having fun in the gym and enjoying the process is important

- Fucking around for an hour in the gym with your friends does not count as training

- Your training plan is probably too optimized

- Taking a day off from training shouldn't derail your next session and cause you anxiety.

- Taking advice from /r/climbharder as gospel will either get you injured, or confuse you into taking rare Chinese mushrooms and cinching tubes around your biceps for BFR gainz.

- Record yourself trying hard. Understand where you're weak

- Train your weaknesses and climb your strengths

- Trying hard is the beta you need to send
What muscles are put in higher demand by hanging on a smaller edge? I recently transitioned from minimum edge hangs on a 15mm edge to 10mm, and I was wondering, other than forearms and pulley tendons, what else is being taxed by the smaller edge size? It definitely feels like I have to try a lot harder to hang 10mm and it feels like my back/shoulders are more engaged, but it's hard to tell if this is real or imagined muscular exertion. 

Put differently, if you were thinking of using hangs to train your back/shoulders, would hanging on 10mm be a better back/shoulder workout than hanging 20mm or hanging on a bar? 

I'd also be interested to know how this translates to slopers/pinches. Is every climbing hold just a pullup bar plus additional forearm/grip/pulley strength requirements? Or is there more going on?
How do I get over my blind panic at taking lead falls? I have never been super comfortable taking lead falls but it's gotten a lot worse recently.

I just moved and the first night at my new climbing gym I top roped with a random person who had just passed the belay test. When lowering he fucked up and dropped me about 25 feet. Thank god he was using a gri gri. He panicked and let go of it which saved me. Turned out he didn't have a hand on the break strand and accidentally pulled the lever all the way back. Since that, even lowering on top rope I get freaked out if all slack isn't 100% taken before I weight the rope. 

I signed up for a class on taking and catching lead falls to get more comfortable with it, but I didn't do great. Even taking falls on top rope with a lot of slack in the class to "practice" I panicked really hard. When I had to take a big fall I started hyperventilating. I was almost crying and shaking. I managed to take a few falls on a vertical wall, but when it came to taking a fall on an overhanging wall I just couldn't do it. I was consumed with illogical blind panic. I'm not scared of hitting the ground or anything like that. I know my belayer will catch me but I just couldn't do it. I ended up down climbing. I feel like such a failure. 

I lead outside most weekends. I'm one of the only two in our group who knows how so I need to set ropes for the other guys. I do ok on things that I know I won't fall on, like 5.7s but as soon as I feel like I might slip even if I'm right at the bolt and there is minimal slack in the system I start panicking. This is really hurting my climbing ability. Indoors I top rope high 5.10s and low 5.11s but the highest I've lead recently is a 5.9. 

How do I get over this? I know I need to take lots of falls, but I can't make myself let go or do hard moves.
Train Your Antagonists!!! I’ve been Moonboarding for around 2 months — initially, I struggled a lot with regular V4s, much less the benchmarks. I’ve gotten to the point where I can pretty easily flash any V4. This is on a 40 degree board. 


I realized that my weak point was shoulder activation. When I jumped up to grab a hold, I would sort of loosely swing my feet out — I thought I was “holding body tension” because I was really engaging my abs… this was not the case. 


After watching a video of myself moonboarding, I noticed that when I performed a big move, my shoulders/chest were literally a full foot away from the board itself, which meant my fingers were taking more abuse then they needed to, vs. if my body was properly held closer to the board. 


I ended up training overhead presses for 2 months, going from a 135 max to a 165 max, and it’s absolutely helped my bouldering abilities. I feel like I have a significantly better understanding &amp; connection with my shoulders, and when I activate them during big moves I feel sooooo much more solid, my torso/legs swing out less than half the distance they used to. 

For reference, I’m 6’0” and 175lbs. Also, just to showcase how out-of-balance my strengths &amp; weaknesses were: 

Deadlift: 455lbs 
Previous Bench: 155 (not even bodyweight) 
Current Bench: 175 (getting there lol) 


TLDR; Train your antagonist muscles. I promise you’ll be surprised after a few weeks of training.
Anecdote about moonboard grade vs outdoor performance - how true is it? I heard from someone that oftentimes your highest moonboard grade will be 2 grades lower than your outdoor grade (of the same style). 

Does anyone find this to be true? Or experience the opposite? I'd be interested to hear about it. 

Personally, I've climbed a few V8s on the 2016 setup, but I cannot fathom climbing anything around V9-10 at the moment, but maybe that's a mental thing, who knows!
Is the new Beastmaking book more than a bunch of hangboard protocols? I’m pretty interested in the “fingers-first” philosophy in training. I think I’ll buy the book if this concept is significantly expanded upon. 

If it’s just a compelling tag line then I think I’ll pass. 

I’m not asking for spoilers or insider secrets form the book- I’m just looking to see if there’s something here that is not abundantly provided in other popular training books and programs. 

Thanks in advance!
How much weight loss do you think it takes to make a significant difference to your climbing level? As the title says but with more context: 

I am female 157cm and weigh 60kgs, which is quite heavy for my size. 

I currently climb 7c+ (5.13a) consistiently, and have climbed 8a (5.13b).  I have a trip coming up and would like to send a route at my maximum on this trip, I have started a diet and would like to have an idea from other peoples experience how much weight loss do you THINK is required to see an improvement / difference in your climbing? 

For reference (and before people say something ) I have a really good relationship with food, and am dieting on CICO, with a focus on protein and fats. I have dieted once before to reduce my weight from 67kgs to my current 60kgs two years ago and have maintained since.
How Far Did You Get In Climbing Before Incorporating A Training Regimen? I typically climb in the gym 1 day per week, outdoors 1 day on the weekend, hangboard once per week, and do a calisthenics routine once per week. My gym days are not very structured, they basically consist of climbing as many routes/problems as I can with increasing difficulty. My hangboard sessions are a mix of repeaters and max hangs. While this may be considered by some to be "training", I don't think it really is in the traditional sense. I definitely don't have training and sending "seasons", I prioritize climbing outdoors year-round. Maybe I would call it a very light form of training. I'm curious though, what grades (indoor or outdoor) were you able to achieve before you implemented an actual training regimen? And for those who have implemented a strict training regimen to climb harder grades, was the lifestyle adjustment worth it? Do you think you are having more or less fun than before?
Fighting fire with fire: Fixing fragile elbows using the campus board. Over the years I've had a lot of struggles fending off elbow tendonopathies (both medial and lateral) when I work powerful boulder problems. Standard pre-hab techniques (opposition, eccentrics, good warm-up) are mostly sufficient for keeping my elbows feeling ok, but I would still be susceptible to flare-ups, usually caused by a lot of straight-forward power pulling. My suspicion was that I just wasn't conditioned properly to do the kind of explosive movement that caused the pain. So I decided to test this by *very* gradually introducing campusing to my workouts. By "very gradual" I mean starting with 3 sets of 1-1.5-match on big rungs and taking ~6 months to get to 3 sets of 1-3-5-match. My elbows feel pretty much rock solid now and are able to withstand much more of the type of movement that previously caused pain. 
The campus board is typically disrecommended for people with elbow issues. I'm wondering if anyone else has taken the opposite approach - using the campus board to fix or prevent dodgy elbows.
How to maximize my time and energy on a long day trip? Being mid 30s and working a full time job… I don’t have a lot of opportunities to climb outside. On the days I do have off, I usually take day trips to a crag about 2 hours away. I leave at 5am in the morning and usually try to climb about 8 hours. 

How do you guys maximize your time and energy efficiently for such a day? What types of problems (ie crimpy, powerful, slabby, etc) should I start with or end with? When in the day should I plan to climb at my max projecting grade? What should i bring to eat/drink?

I’ve climbed more or less for 6-7 years now and I’ve never stuck to a particular regimen. Even worse, I’m not detail oriented whatsoever and haven’t taken notice of what works for me and what doesn’t. As my chances to go out decrease however, I’ve noticed I really need to be smart with my limited time and energy in order to maximize my progress. 

Was wondering what you guys did. Thank you!

*edit: thanks for the great responses!
Interview with Kung Fu climber (beginner with iron fingers and awesome mindset) So a few weeks back [I asked for interview questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/pr336s/help_me_interview_a_new_climber_with_a_background/), because I met someone who was doing 7a/v6 on his first day of climbing. He had terrible technique, but somehow managed to hang on and finish climbs. As it turned out, he had done kung fu for 13 years and specifically trained finger strength.

Thank you guys so much for your questions, I really like how the interview ended up so I appreciate your input. It covers a lot more than just finger strength, in fact the parts I love most are about mindset.

You can find the interview here: [https://youtu.be/V\_tm-bKrurk](https://youtu.be/V_tm-bKrurk)

If you have any follow up questions for Olavo, please ask on YouTube so that everyone can see Olavo’s answer in case they had the same question.

If you’re only interested in one part, here are some timestamps:

* 0:18 How he trained for iron fingers
* 2:15 Working on your base
* 03:25 Mindset: finding mastery in every movement
* 03:55 Training mindset 
* 05:05 Training grip strength &amp; contact strength
* 06:20 How kung fu helped him train for stability
* 08:26 Injury prevention
* 08:57 Body tension
* 09:56 Dyno coordination and balance
* 10:37 Mindset: finding "The Way"
* 11:51 How he learns technique

&amp;#x200B;

u/Kingnahum17: he didn't answer ginger strength training but did answer all your other questions :) u/TrollStopper: a lot of the interview turned out to be about mindset, so you were entirely right! u/LargeWooWoo: you were 100% right with the grip strength exercise! u/thisisclarke: It’s not in the video but he doesn’t have any experience with dit da jow. u/TheGrimBleeper: cool to see you also did Kung Fu! Let us know if you have anything to add to the interview based on your background. u/Cirqka: didn't ask about finger recovery specifically, but the exercise he suggests where you grab a bag of sand sounds very applicable for climbers!
Has anyone climbed on the grasshopper and kilter home boards? At some point in the near future I'm looking to put in an adjustable home climbing wall.  I have little kids (3 and 5) so I'd like it to be accessible for them, and I'd like it to be friendly to guests of variable climbing ability.  I've maxed out myself at V10 and 5.14a and would like to be able to train myself too.

I thought that I had found the right approach when I realized that grasshopper had a hold set that looked really nice, as it seemed to fit my needs more than the moon or tension holds.  But I didn't realize that Kilter had a home set now.  Can anyone speak to the comparison between these two sets of holds?  All these options are giving me analysis paralysis.
Minimum training volume for high end climbing? One of the common things I see when people talk about preventing injuries is to reduce the volume of training and climbing.  This naturally raises the question: what is the minimum training volume for high end climbing?

I've been climbing for 11 years and redpointed 5.14a, but have been constantly battling finger injuries of various kinds ever since I started breaking in to 5.13+ about 3 years ago. I'm curious to hear if others have experimented with trying to maintain a high level of climbing (and maybe progressing slowly) while reducing the overall volume to a minimum...
Any weightlifters that climb here? Curious to hear if there are any other weightlifters here and what your routines / splits look like. 

I'm a new-ish climber (started during the lockdowns) and typically climb 2x a week, lift 3-4x a week. Currently around the v3-4 range. 

I have a chest/back and a legs/shoulders split that I've made up after starting out with stronglifts (the 5x5 routine). Same idea, but introduced more exercises to surround the compound lifts. 

Curious to hear what kind of splits people have and how often they train during the week, and what kind of adjustments you all have made to incorporate climbing.
Back in climbing after several years off - tendon vs muscle strength Hey folks, after a bit of advice 

A quick background story. I used to climb up to grade 30/31 Sport in Australia up until about 3 years ago. I developed a reaction to the drying agents inside metalious \[and other popular\] chalks which unfortunately made my fingers peal like no tomorrow. Things got so bad that I couldn't do a single burn on any of my projects without bleeding and being in agonising pain. After years of trying to come back to the sport \[mild depression because of the circumstances\], visits to specialists and various treatment creams I am finally okay to climb again

I continued my gym training outside of climbing. Which meant that I have lost only a part of my strength in some areas and gained it in others, whilst my tendons/finger strength/pulleys have gone backwards to god knows which levels. My endurance and power-endurance are non existent as you'd expect

Number one priority and why I am asking for advice: I am terrified I will injure my pulleys/tendons and I am super paranoid about this because of the extreme misbalance between my pulling power and what my tendons can handle

At the moment only climbing on plastic. Only bouldering (It's the only thing I currently have access to). I am only climbing on holds that are larger than my pads, (avoiding all rail crimps) concentrating on movement, body tension and technique. Open hand only, no full or half crimping. I have been climbing now for the last three weeks. V5-V7 Indoors

My forearms and fingers do not currently ache or in any discomfort. I am definitely under-utilising and under training them. Has anyone on here been in similar situation or perhaps is able to offer any advice how to safely train and what to look out for outside the obvious? Hangboard seems like a huge overkill and I've never really used one before. Just going for climbs and seeing where my limit is, seems risky. Am I being too much of a pussy and should just try a few crimps climbs and see how I feel? Bellow are my stats in case they are revenant

Height 169cm - Current weight around 75kg (69kg at my climbing peak)  
3 Sets of 3x Pull ups with 60kg added weight   
3 Sets of 3x 135kg bench press   
Front levers on bars are okay-ish (start great for the first 10 seconds before the inevitable sag)
How to not get injured? I've been climbing for 7 years or so and I would say that the biggest inhibitor for my improvement is that I get injured too often. It seems thatevery time I get to climbing 12b I'll get a couple month injury due to over use. Medial elbow tendonopathy in one elbow then the other took me out for about half a year each time. This year it's a sprained wrist for the last 2 months. 

This winter I was looking forward to training in a more structured way to get past that plateau but here I am injured again. I even thought I was doing better antagonist training, resting between and warming up before sessions. Anyways, that's enough of the woe is me bit.

Does anyone know any good resources out there for ways to stay healthy while still trying your hardest? Specific warm up routines, prehab routines, etc? I like this dumb sport and I'd like to keep doing it for a long while.
How does the body heal a full rupture of a finger pulley without surgery? Will rest and rehab somehow reform to its previous state for the pulleys to wrap around the tendon again?
Share some examples of non-talanted crushers. We all know about the 5.15 climber that reached 5.13 on theirs first year of climbing. But do you know some examples of climbers that struggled a lot in their first years of climbing and than broke some platue and jumped into their progression.
Those of you who live in your car / van / RV: What does your training look like ! Hi folks! I've been lurking here for a while, but decided to form an account to post here. Currently, I'm living full time out of a smaller car, but by the end of the year, I'll be living full time in a smaller cargo van. This is relatively new for me, so I'm still working out all the kinks. When I was living in an actual house, with my own room, etc., I had access to a fridge, more complicated forms of cooking, door frames to mount a pullup bar / hangboard, space to stretch / roll out, etc. Now that ⠀I'm living in a car, my ability to do these things has changed. For example, hangboarding involves finding a tree that I can hang the board from, and cooking is limited to a frying pan and a basic camping stove. These are some "negative" losses in terms of how I can train. On the other hand, my new mobility allows me to stay 10mins away from any crag I want within a 2 hour range of my school, so long as I have service on my phone to do work, etc. Anyways, I'm just curious... if you are someone who's living a non-traditional life, such as in a car, or RV, or van, what does your training look like? Right now, a big barrier in some aspects is that all the gyms around me are still closed. What's your training looking like right now? How has living in a car / van / RV affected, either positively or negatively, your training, performance, and so on?
Does anyone else flag like a lunatic? I struggle with traverse movements on small footholds — I often combat the feeling of “low foot security” by flagging one leg REALLY far out, or really high up the wall… and it makes me feel like a lunatic, because it looks like I’m flailing around on the wall just sticking my legs all over the place, desperately searching for a fourth point of contact. I also often hit other route’s holds as well.

One of my theories is that I have pretty shit shoulder flexibility, so I probably lean out from the wall too far when reaching for the next hold. This might be causing my foot insecurities, but I think it’s also a mental thing for me. 

How have you guys &amp; girls built up a sense of security on tiny footholds? Are there any exercises or techniques that you’ve done in the past to get a better “mind-foot connection”, for lack of a better phrase? 

For reference, I’m a relatively large climber at 6’0” 175-180lbs. I typically project in the V8 range. I currently wear 6-month-old solutions, the toe is still decent. I’ve thought about trying a softer shoe like Dragos to see if that gives me a better sense of what my toes are doing on the wall.
I released the Pro version of BoulderBot for Android, an App for procedurally generating boulders on home climbing walls Hello everybody!

A few months ago I posted a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/miitt8/i_trained_a_procedural_generation_model_to_create/) introducing BoulderBot, an App I've been working on for generating (using a Procedural Generation model) and logging boulder problems on home climbing walls and spray walls. I'm really grateful for all the feedback I received!

&amp;#x200B;

After these months of working and polishing the App I'm psyched to finally release the Pro version of BoulderBot, whose main features are:

* Advanced generation functionality: select specific holds, draw paths, and specify rules and hold types
* Detailed statistics, including heat maps to maximize the usage of all the holds
* Advanced Wall Editor for fine tuning hold information, including setting type, direction, and more granular control of difficulty (including for footholds)
* Image Upgrade functionality (useful when adding new holds to an existing wall)
* Improved problem organization, including rules, tags, lists, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The Pro features are available as an In-App purchase, of course if you are not interested in the advanced functionality the App can still be used in the standard free mode (which has been updated as well with optimizations, minor improvements to the generation algorithm and some UI tweaks, and will keep receiving updates alongside the Pro version).

&amp;#x200B;

The App is at the moment available only for Android: [Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boulderbot.app.android&amp;utm_source=rdtp)

Sorry for not having the iOS version ready yet! Right now it's my priority number one, it's almost done (all that's left is mostly UI stuff) but I prefer taking the time to release something polished and bug free rather than rushing it out (originally I planned releasing the Pro and iOS versions together).

After the iOS version is out I also have a lot of new features and improvements planned, including sharing walls and problems with friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Happy to answer any question and for any feedback!
My wrist seems to pop on slopers sometimes.. Should I be worried? Is this as a result of lack in mobility? Or strength?

I don't seem to loose grip, It seems that the wrist is engaged then extends slightly. It only seems to happen on slopers. It doesn't hurt, but feels like it shouldn't be happening. It's a similar sensation to cracking knuckles, but in the wrist.

Could it be lack of warming up?

6B+/6C boulder is my level, roughly.
The Cult of the Pyramid I've decided to start a new cult in climbing. Unlike the Cult of the Ganja and the Cult of the Rock Prodigy,  its goal isn't just to get you high. The Cult of the Pyramid transcends but embraces all the other cults in climbing.

The premise is simple, seek the pyramid, praise the pyramid, give thanks to the pyramid!

Many here have asked about the best way to improve, how much they should be projecting vs flash/onsight vs mileage. Many want to avoid injury and have long-term progress. Many want to climb hard, but also not lose sight of the joys that climbing brings when you're not fixated on grade chasing. The solution, my dear friends, is the pyramid!

The pyramid is an approach that can direct you. Make a goal pyramid for your entire year, then break that pyramid down to smaller pyramids that cover a climbing season, a month of climbing, even a week, even a day, even an individual workout! That's the beauty of the the pyramid, it can be broken down to smaller pyramids.

Praise the Pyramid!

Are you looking for how to have solid training sessions each time you climb? Try a pyramid! 

If you're bouldering, try one problem that is so hard that you'll only maybe do it after many sessions of effort, try two problems that you could do in one to two sessions but is still very hard. Do three problems you can't flash but you can do that day with effort. Do four problems that are hard flashes (or close enough). If you're looking for mileage, still create a pyramid but do more problems at each level of it and makes the level grades easier!

Are you climbing routes? If you want intensity, take the same approach as with the bouldering, hard route on top, routes that take two to four efforts one level down, hard onsights next, medium onsights next. Want mileage? Hard onsight on top, medium onsight, easy onsight, easier onsight.

Do you feel this approach is too much climbing?  Simple!  Make your pyramid more skinny! While the cult of the pyramid loves phat pyramids, it respects skinny ones as well.

Praise the Pyramid!

Do you feel like climbing isn't fun anymore? Is it because you're spending too much time worrying about pushing your grades? The Pyramid has prepared a way for you! Take a step back and find the joys of creating a large base of climbing underneath your goal grades. This will improve your skill, your confidence, your capacity, and will fill you with the joy of getting to the top of stuff instead of falling off for the millionth time in a row. Try some different styles. Try some different rock. Find joy in the expression of adventure and climbing without worry of grades or difficulty. But also find joy when you go to climb hard, you are fully prepared for it.

Praise the Pyramid!

Are you feeling like  you're on a plateau? The Pyramid serves as a guide for when you are ready for the next grade. Have you done 20  x 5.11+ and 30 x 5.11- this year? You're ready for 5.12 my friend! Having a Pyramid and staying true to it keeps you honest about your improvement and reveals to you when you're ready for the Next Level.

Praise!

The Cult of the Pyramid is not a dogma. The Pyramid recognizes that it is not always the right approach for everything. Sometimes the Brotherhood of the Diamond, a sect of the Cult of the Pyramid, has the answers you desire. Other times the Git 'Er Done Coven is the answer you desire. Answers even come from the Group of the Chaos and the Order of the YOLO at times.

The Cult of the Pyramid is aware of this, but humbly asserts that often those approaches are exceptions rather than the best way to proceed.

I am happy to answer further questions as my time permits about the Cult of the Pyramid.

Praise the Pyramid!
Anybody else also hesitant to try again on their hardest sent projects? I mainly boulder and there are a lot of projects I've sent at my gym that's at my redpoint level that are still up. After I've sent it the first go, I'm always hesitant on subsequent sessions to try it again. I know it's a fear of failing and feeling like I'm regressing in my climbing if I fall off. I'm just curious if anybody else is like that and also wondering if there are any benefits of trying to repeat your redpoint projects or if it's better to just project something else?
Good workout regimen for stronger Legs/core? I normally warm up w some calisthenics , do some reps with weights, and lifting but I just want to try something new and fun
How well does moonboard climbing transfers to outdoor climbing? As university started for me i became a weekend warrior for the time being and i started training exclusively on the moonboard. I broke my ankle a few months ago and bouldering on the gym sets is something i avoid because all the boulders are kinda hight and the mats are hard. 

I was wondering as i am improving a lot on the moonboard will this transfer on real rock. Am i getting better at climbing or am i getting better at climbing on the moonboard? For reference i jumped from a 3-4 7A's climbed on the board to consistently climbing and flashing up to 7A+ and i have a few 7B's, but never tried higher grades than this. 

I will be glad to hear your stories of how did moonboard climbing impacted your climbing level once you started using it consistently. This probably depends on the weaknesses of the individual as a technical, weak and static climber will gain much more than a super strong dynamic climber that can jump for some yellow shitty holds. 

What's your general opinion on only training on a moonboard?
A guide to elbow pain for rock climbers Many climbers struggle with elbow pain - usually medial or lateral epicondylosis, but not only. On the web and in climbing books, you can find countless resources on how to recover from elbow injuries, but the advice is often hard to implement without knowing what outcome to expect. As I've struggled with elbow pain myself, and I know many people who've had it too, I decided to put the information I could find together in one comprehensive [article](https://strengthclimbing.com/elbow-pain-the-ultimate-guide-for-rock-climbers/).

I searched many climbing resources and forums, but I also did a pretty thorough science literature search to include as many potential treatment strategies as possible, including manual therapy, eccentrics, antagonist training, ultrasound, lasers, DTF, dry needling, acupuncture, etc. For me, eccentrics and DTF did the job, but I know people who were successful with dry needling and other methods.

To make sure that the presented data is accurate, I teamed up with Dr. Jared Vagy, aka The Climbing Doctor, who proofread the post and added many valuable comments and improvements. Although it's challenging to recover from elbow pain completely, and the injury has a tendency to return, we hope that you will find this post helpful.
Logbooks for Climbing &amp; Hangboarding I've had some great results by keeping notes on my climbing, at first I was taking notes in a plain notebook. Before each session I'd write down how I was feeling, what I'd ate, how I slept and other variables. By doing this I was able to decide what I wanted out of my training session. If I was feeling great then I'd have a limit day, if I was feeling not so good then I'd have a slower skill focused day.

After the session I would take notes on what I worked on, what I sent, what I'd learnt, any training that I did. Immediately I noticed the differences. I went into each session knowing what I wanted to get done and this lead to more productive sessions which lead to improvements in my climbing.

But after I while I grew tired of having to structure out each page, the notes became cluttered and it was hard to compare them.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had to take some time off climbing lately due to injury and I've used the spare time to design 2 logbooks:

**Climbing Logbook**

https://preview.redd.it/892h3o5yidu71.png?width=1934&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d0a70d83b7704c54227c7dd77284b8e47a9dd47

The Climbing Logbook gives you space to make notes on each of your climbing sessions; what climbs you sent, what climbs you worked on, what exercises you did, what climbing skills you worked, what drills you worked on, what you want to come back to, what you want to do differently next time. It can help going into your next session to read notes of the previous ones to pick up where you left off, instead of mindlessly going to the gym and trying the new set of climbs.

The top section is space to get a bit nerdy. Before your session make notes of how you're feeling that day, how you ate, how you slept, and other variables that impact your training. At first you might be wondering why am I doing this, but after a while you'll start to notice correlations between what influences good days and bad ones and this can lead to you making adjustments to have better training sessions. 

Once you have rated how you're feeling, theres space to set a goal for your training. Spending that bit of time thinking about how you're feeling is really useful in planning and making the most of your session. If you're going into a session and you note that you Sleep was 2/5 and your hydration was 1/5 then you probably aren't going to want to get on that project you've been working on. Adjust your goal according to how you're feeling and what you're more likely to achieve.

At the bottom is space to track exercises whether it be campusing, hangboarding, bodyweight or weightlifting (up to 5 exercises, 3 sets on each)

The climbing logbook has space to record 120 training sessions.

**Hangboard Logbook**

https://preview.redd.it/w8f7ppsaldu71.png?width=2736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f3ded277988953d06bb0223c323de44d7d80cd2

For each hangboard session there is space to record 12 working sets and 3 warm up sets.  Keep notes on your hangs such as the edge size, grip type, weight added/removed and time spent hanging and how difficult that set felt. The top section is the same as the Climb logbook and allows you to take notes of how you're feeling that day, how you ate, how you slept, and other variables that impact your training.

Keeping a log of hang sessions can be a great motivation. It really helps to look back on sessions from months ago and see those incremental improvements. It doesn't take much time or effort and it can be done in between sets.  Having the same page structure makes it clear and easy to compare your notes

v5-6 Plateau I'm in a super weird position in my climbing. I can flash almost every v3-v4 in my gym but can't even start any of the v5-6. I don't think its about strength. However I know I'm terrible on slopers, my technique isn't the best and i'm bad at route reading. Has anyone else experienced the same thing and/or has advice on how to move past it.
My Indoor grades not translating to outdoor grades. Tips? So I’ve been climbing for a few years now, and I’m climbing around the V5-6 range indoors (I can do many of the 2016 V4 benchmarks, for comparison). However, every time I go on a bouldering trip, I can’t climb anything above a V2, sometimes I can’t even climb any of the problems I try including V0s (looking at you Yosemite and Joshua Tree)

I suppose my question is, how do I get better at outdoor bouldering. Do I just need to Boulder outdoor more? Should I be focusing on something else inside while training? 

Any advice greatly appreciated!
Does anyone know what Yves Gravelle for training I follow him on Instagram and the guy is absolutely insane with his strength. Not just climbing, but overall strength.

I’d love to be able to do 6mm one arm pull-ups or those insane campus board moves. 

Anyone know what he does for training, or if you’re strong like him, what do you do?

I do a lot of calisthenics already; OAP, tuck planche push ups, HSPU, FL, etc
Does bouldering leads to more technical improvent than route climbing? Ok so one for sure is true. Bouldering makes you strong. It's much better for your strength than route climbing. But what about technique?

 As bouldering allows you to make much more tries on a single move and at the same time bouldering is more complex (i am not sure about that) is it better for your technique? 
On the other side, route climbing allows you to do much more moves but of course easier.

I am talking about outdoors only. The same might apply indoors too, but todays indoor bouldering is much much different from route climbing so it's hard to compare them.
Stretches and exercises specific for drop knees How do I get them Ondra drop knees? Do I need to do a deal with the devil?

I'm not to bad at drop knees already, actually I love them but I want to get my knees ready for them super heavy drop knees. I've done some reading and it seems like hip internal rotation stretches and strengthening is what I'm after.  All I have found recommended is the hip 90/90, but I can't find any other information on more difficult hip internal rotation exercises.
Best bouldering areas in the world Let's get a discussion going. Where have you guys bouldered and what is the nicest place?


I personally really like Kjugekull, Sweden.
Struggling with managing climbing / training volume (for tendon / ligament health) Hi everyone,  
Since I’ve started being more systematic about training, the main thing I have really struggled with is deciding my total training volume (hangboard frequency, styles of climbing, when and how long to deload for, etc.) in order to maintain healthy fingers. I now have had a few cycles of PIP joint synovitis and one minor pulley tweak. 

In all of these cases, I was able to catch up to my previous strength and reach a new peak in my climbing abilities by taking a bit of full rest, followed by starting with very low volume and progressively increasing the stimulus. However, I imagine that I would be even better off from not dealing with these injuries in the first place. 

Based on this, here are a few questions I have for the veteran climbers here: 

* Is it normal to have finger issues (e.g. synovitis) every few months when you’re climbing fairly hard? 
* Have you found that “deload weeks”, where you reduce volume substantially, are necessary to maintain finger health?
* Can you tell when you need to deload, or do you plan this in advance (e.g. 4 week cycles)?
* Similarly, can you tell how long your deload should be, or do you also just plan this in advance? 
* Suppose you know how much volume you can handle without getting injured — how do you decide when it’s time to increase volume? (Or do you just never increase volume and just do the same volume while climbing harder as you get better?) 
* Is there a ballpark figure for how much weight your soft tissues can adapt to with max hangs over time? (e.g. starting from bodyweight, I found that my muscles can adapt to a 5 pound increase each time I max hang (once a week), but I doubt the tendons / ligaments, especially pulleys, adapt that quickly). 

I realize this is a lot of questions, I don’t expect anyone to answer all of them, these are just the things I’m wondering that I have a feeling people here would have insight into.

I have a good starting point for getting better at managing volume, which is to look at my log and try to answer these questions. Based on my training log, I’m going to make hypotheses about how I can manage my volume better — but from outside perspectives here I may be able to create hypotheses that are more likely to be correct. 

Relevant background: I have been climbing for around 2.5 years now, and have been training systematically (focusing on weaknesses, increasing max hang weight over time, changing my style of climbing, etc.) for a little over a year. Current pull up 3rep max is +65 pounds, open crimp max hang is +50lb for \~8s, and I boulder \~v6 consistently and rarely get v7s in the gym (though I can usually do a good number of the moves). I put a lot of effort into developing good technique and don’t think my strength is too far ahead of technique, especially for my preferred styles (roofs / overhangs). I love both sport and bouldering, and cycle between focusing on one or the other, typically on the scale of 4-6 weeks.
Climbing &amp; Depression Hi there. I’ve been climbing on and off for over a decade, mostly in a gym. I’m in an on phase and have been consistently getting to the gym 2-4 days/week. Lately I’ve been struggling with depression (I’m getting help in that regard) and sometimes when I’m climbing I just feel like crap and can’t/don’t want to push myself the way I want to want to push myself. I originally thought to just keep going for the exercise and I still have some days that are great, but other days it just makes me cranky and now I’m wondering if I should take a break. Has anyone else gone through this? Any advice? Thanks
PSA: Feeling connective tissue, joint, ligament, or finger soreness is not normal and almost always a sign that your frequency, volume and intensity are too high With in the influx of injury threads, I'm going to talk about this more. I've posted [this article from Renaissance periodization](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/training-volume-landmarks-muscle-growth/) several times before here when discussing these topics. It's specifically written for hypertrophy, but we can think about the ability of the connective tissues to adapt in a similar manner with a bit of an exception to pushing into too much volume (e.g. soreness being good for hypertrophy, but not good for connective tissues). 

Here's a visual description of the concepts discussed in said article above.

https://stevenlow.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Adaptation-graph.jpg

The article is not 100% accurate but a general representation. Biological processes run generally follow curvature responses (e.g. hormesis is one that is different than a more standardized adaptation bell curve), but they can differ depending on the amount of adaptation to various stresses. 

Generally speaking, most connective tissue, pulley, joint, and such soreness happens when you are ranging into MRV or past that. The overuse injury risk is high. 99% of the time people need to back off substantially on either the intensity or volume or both at these times and let the tissues recover. Then they can build up slowly. Incremental progress.

Typically, the maximal adaptive volume range for most of us non-professional climbers is somewhere in the 3x a week range and stopping right before or right at when your maximal performance starts to drop in a session. For most people that's probably about 1.5-2 hours or so with adequate rest times. Work capacity can increase depending on your fitness and how long you've been climbing so it can shift up which is why you have people able to make good progress at 4-5x a week and slightly longer sessions, but jumping into such increased frequency and longer sessions takes month if not years to build up to. 

--------------------------------

Let's look at an example of myself from several years ago and my training now. One that was closer to MRV and one that is closer to MEV. 

Several years ago I was:

* climbing 2.5-3 hour sessions 3x a week
* 2-3x a week lifting for an hour. Usually 2 exercises for 3 sets for push, pull, legs, and core (~24 total sets).
* 2-3x a week hangboarding probably 2-3 grips for 4-5 sets each. 

Made solid progress but was probably closer to MRV range or so as I got some aches and pain here and there. Now I literally go for:

* 1-1.5 hour sessions climbing 2-3x a week
* 1 set of 3-4 exercises in the gym
* No hangs for 2-4 sets of 1 grip

Make progress with all of the 3 areas and am feeling stronger on the wall too. Part of it right now is my recovery isn't as good with a newborn, but most of the time people drastically overestimate the amount they need to do to make progress. Being closer to the MEV-MAV range is often better than trending toward the MRV range especially if it's your fingers, connective tissues, and joints feeling it.

This isn't to say what I'm doing is optimal, but it's not something I'm in isolation saying about this type of stuff. Tyler Nelson talked a bit about this in [The Nugget Podcast](https://thenuggetclimbing.com/episodes/tyler-nelson) in the section on: 1:22:58 – Emil Abrahamsson, Keith Bar, and the “No Hangs” hangboard protocol

Tyler speculates the reason why some lower intensity stuff might work for a bunch of people is because it's deloading. People gotta fit in all the things like climbing, working out, hangboard, campus board, and whatever all the time, but maybe everyone is just doing too much and the deload is what is helping substantially. 

He also speculates earlier in the podcast (which I agree with) that he looked at how some of the pro climbers sending V15-16 were training like 5-6x a week for several hours at a time and thinks they could probably be doing V17-18. However, the thing holding them back is the fact that they're in a chronically overreaching/overtrained state so their performance in lowered. If they dropped to a reasonable schedule they could probably send harder. 

The [Alex Puccio program discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/nuiznh/alex_puccio_virtual_or_in_person_training_is_it/) comes to mind in that respect. Not knocking on her, but this is generally something most people have to learn over time by themselves unless they have really good coaches... and most coaches in climbing at least for now don't know a whole lot about implementing quality structured programs based on injury prevention and periodization. 

--------------------------------

In any case, getting back to the topic: you do not need soreness, achiness, or anything like that to progress in most attributes. The one exception is specific hypertrophy training and you only want to be somewhat soreness to make sure you get enough eccentric damage to the muscle. You want to be fully recovered for the next session for the muscles. However, joint, ligament, connective tissue, and pulley soreness is detrimental and increases your susceptibility not just for overuse injuries but for catastrophic injuries like pulley tears as well as the tissue is already chronically overused. 

Don't make training mistakes that can injure you for the long run. Back off and find frequency, intensity, and volume where these symptoms are not happening. 

Don't have time to go over specific injuries, but most people who have been here for years know about my other injury articles on climbing include: [pulleys](https://stevenlow.org/rehabbing-injured-pulleys-my-experience-with-rehabbing-two-a2-pulley-issues/), [tendonitis / tendinopathy](https://stevenlow.org/overcoming-tendonitis/), [PIP synovitis](https://stevenlow.org/beating-climbing-injuries-pip-synovitis/), [low back](https://stevenlow.org/low-back-pain-from-crippled-to-100-in-10-days/), and [general treatment of hand and finger injuries](https://stevenlow.org/treatment-of-climber-hand-and-finger-injuries/).

**Edit**: perhaps I didn't make it clear. I'm not saying muscle soreness is not necessary. It is definitely necessary for hypertrophy training and maybe some strength training. I'm saying that connective tissue soreness is almost always counterproductive because at the point your connective tissues are sore they are already at the point where they are microscopically injured and compromised in terms of ability to bear load well and adapt. It's not the same thing as overreaching with muscles which can be a good thing.
How to tell if I need stronger shoulders? Hi y’all! Spokes with a couple of my coaches and the consensus was I don’t need to focus as heavily on my technique but a lot more on my strength overall. Just wondering what areas I should focus on. To start I know my core and chest are adequately strong. I’m pretty sure I could benefit from stronger shoulders and I think my fingers are decent right now. 

My 1RM for pull-ups is 95 lbs (55% body weight roughly)
My max weighted hang on 20mm for 7 seconds is 100 lbs
(I have held a one arm hang at 90% body weight for 5-6 seconds before but not sure if this information is as accurate for assessing finger strength)
Ondra Training Interview Help Hello, I've found [this](https://vimeo.com/304029751) interview with Adam Ondra. According to the description he goes into some detail about how he trains - something I and I assume many others here would love to know more about. It is in Spanish, which I unfortunately don't speak, and I can't find any subtitles. I was wondering if there is anybody here who would be willing to help out in some way? For example a summary? At least I hope it will be useful for the Spanish speakers!

Thanks!
Trouble with commitment (usually last move) So I have a bouldering problem that's not really technical in nature. I have trouble with commitment at heights. Even the small bouldering height of 3 or 4 meters.

The guy running my local gym set a couple of problems with a low crux and I ended up climbing some much harder climbs than usual, 6a and doing well on some 6b problems.. But if those moves were up top I could never have done them.

I find myself unable to literally let go to reach for the next hold.. Even if I am stable.

Anyone else overcome this?
Started Climbing at Young Age. Lingering Finger Soreness? Background: I started climbing at about 13. Got really into bouldering in my early 20s, hit V10, had plenty of finger and shoulder injuries along the way. A decade later and I'm back at it. Working through V4s and V5s on the Moonboard (what a tool! Probably 2 days a week), and taking it relatively slow, backing off if there's pain or uncomfortable tension, etc. Taking time to build up my shoulders with lots of physio exercises (I've had a couple blown rotator cuffs), and in general climbing with the long-term in mind.

**OF COURSE: My fingers are sore.** However, they have been for a long time. Warmed up they're fine, but have an almost arthritic feel day to day. If memory serves me correct, this was the case when I was climbing a ton a decade ago, too. Massage and heat helps. In both of my middle fingers lower pulley, there's a lump of scar tissue (or something?) that has been there probably for a decade, even when not climbing/training. 

So, what's the deal? Is this just the result of training finger strength from a young age? Or a "too much too soon" problem? If it's an ongoing thing, any tips for long-term management and signals to watch out for?

Thanks in advance! I know there are many posts about finger soreness, but I think this is a slightly different scenario than one might find being new to bouldering/climbing.

Cheers!
What do you do at the small hint of an injury? I'm referring to small discomforts that don't hurt performance like some finger soreness. In my case I tried my 1rm weighted pull up and now feel a small odd feeling on the outside of my elbow, but no real pain just a slight tingle occasionally. I'm unsure if it's the onset of something like tennis elbow.

In cases like these does ignoring it generally work out or does it pay off to rest it for a few days?
Trainingbeta.com Bouldering Training Structure I decided I need a structured training program to move past a plateau in bouldering, so I found the structured training program on [www.trainingbeta.com](https://www.trainingbeta.com) and signed up. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, what appears at surface level to be a periodized training program sorta, well... isn't.

It has "blocks" of Strength, Skill and Power like other periodized programs, but when you dig into the structure each of the blocks is really just the same routines over and over. Granted, there is some small variance like in the power blocks it says to try "hard boulders 3-5 moves of power" for a session, but there is no mention of difference in strength training protocol etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I've noticed that some of the sessions are "density" bouldering sessions where it says to tally up as many V points in 90 minutes as possible (climbing at or below flash level)... which sounded great but I ended up flaring up my tendonitis in the process and now I'm forced to take several rest days in the middle of the training block :( Are these so called "density" sessions actually beneficial? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also if anyone has recommendations for other programs or coaching services I'm all ears. My goal is not to injure myself training, I need to get stronger :)
newbie lead climber question i am an old formerly athletic guy that has only been climbing for a year; doing sport climbing trying to build a base for outdoor. i love it. i recently started doing lead climbs in the gym.  i hope i dont get flamed for this but i get really scared leading harder routes. for me that is any overhung 5.9 just indoor. is that normal? i can usually work through it. break the climb into segments. just work from one clip to the next. try to be chill. just wondering if there is something wrong with me. maybe i am not a climber after all.
Yoga for flexibility Do you guys have any simple and short yoga routines to help flexibility? I want something short enough to do daily regardless of my schedule
What's the best way to improve my route reading? Is it simply to read a lot of routes, or is there something else? [removed]
Is Linear Periodization as boring as it seems? I've been on the plateau of projecting V4s and V5s in my gym for a while now and I would really like to break through it.

I have the "rock climbers training manual" book and i've benefited from some of the advice within it.

But the core thesis of the book is that the best way to improve is to do these multi-month planned linear periodization schedules. Which involve things like weeks of mostly just hangboard training during the "strength phase"

I want to improve, but the idea of going weeks without working projects at my grade limit sounds really uninspiring. At the same time, my current approach of limit bouldering every session may have gotten me as far as it's going to, doesn't feel like im really improving much anymore.

Does anybody have an example training plan that's worked well for them, while still allowing for at least a day of hard projecting per week?
New subreddit announcement - /r/climbingdiscourse Hey all! A new climbing-centered subreddit was created yesterday - /r/climbingdiscourse.

Just wanted to pop in here (after obtaining approval from the mods) to showcase it and give a bit of background. Mainly, /r/climbingdiscourse will be centered around high quality discussion involving the sport and activity of climbing.

This is pretty loose ended, but that's largely the point! As you may know (and with no negative feelings intended), /r/climbing does not allow text posts - but they're arguably the most generic and rounded subreddit for generalized climbing content.

That's where we come in! For right now (this may change later based on feedback), we allow only text posts in order to incentivize discussion-based content on the topic.

Hopefully this gets some good will from the climbing community, and as the subreddit is fairly new (and I myself, am fairly new at managing subreddits in general), the rules, content, concepts, etc - are all intensely up for feedback and continuous improvement.

Let me know what you think! And if you like it, join on up and start contributing! If you have any questions, I'm never more than a mod mail away.
ADHDers - how do you maintain novelty in your training routine (if at all)? I had a really nice routine going for about 10 weeks that I found really satisfying to complete, but like all routines, it works until it ... doesn't. And then you have to figure out a way to get your brain engaged again. How do you get around this?
Given enough time, isn't it inevitable that many climbs will become unclimbable did to holds polishing/wearing down? [removed]
Season ending, very close to finish proj but... Ok as the title says, I have a a few days left before the season ends. I fell twice at the very last hard move (which isn't actually that hard for the route) on my project route. It's around 25 moves (if I don't count the easy top part). The route start with a 7A/B boulder problem with a very decent rest follow by a power endurance test piece with only bad rests, cherry on top being the sketchy pinch left hand, right hand foot match mantle being pumped toasted out of your mind.
Lately (1month) I have focused my training on power endurance but went to the bouldering gym twice.  At this point it's just a matter of luck and number of attempts and having enough mental resilience because it really start to takes its toll

Should I rest completely for the week?
Should i keep training power endurance and rest 2 days prior to the attempts day (my number are still improving on paper but I have been climbing since spring thru summer and not sure I can really get more)
Or should I try to gain what can quickly be gained (a few sessions of weighted pull-ups)
What is most important: Finger- vs Pull- vs Body strength? If you are moderately new to climbing and your **finger-**, **pull-** and **body** strengths are equally good or bad. What would you consider the most important of them to train (if you had to only pick one due to time constraints) in order to move forward?

Let's leave technique and bouldering itself aside. I go bouldering twice a week and have an extra 20-30min before or after the session to incorporate any of the above three elements into the session.

**Update**:

I am talking about indoor bouldering only :-)

**Update 2**:

Thank you for all those comments and shared experiences! From that I will most likely go and spend my additional time on finger strength until I have the experience to figure out my real weaknesses (which I have absolutely no clue at the moment).

watch-worthy video from /u/RayPineocco: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv6_U-XOSgU
Other than much stronger shoulders, is there anything I'm missing here? I can hang in the position with no problem but cannot catch the jump without hitting the ground
Discomfort when training slopers I’ve started trying to train for slopers with the slopey edges on the beastmaker 2000 board. I’ve found that when I do this, almost always I get this strange feeling just below my wrist.

At first I thought it was a pop, but it didn’t hurt, it was just a bit disturbing. It felt like the tendons in my wrist are shifting around. No pain or loss of function the next day either. 

What’s happening here? Is this safe?
Recovery and how "fresh" should I be Hi folks, I'm 28M climbing 3 times a week (Tue, Thurs, Sat). I usually feel strong on Tuesdays after 2 days of rest but on Thursday and Saturday I feel considerably weaker.

As many here advise I've been trying to "leave with some gas in the tank" especially on Tuesdays but I find it easier said than done since I can't get that sweet spot on when to leave.  To be fair, it improved a bit but I still feel pretty weak on the following days.

So my question is: should I always feel "fresh" for all sessions of the weak or is it ok to feel weak on some days? Of course I know that it is inevitable to feel weak some days, but I ask this from an optimal training perspective.

Extra info about me:

* Tuesday: max hang in the morning, climbing in the afternoon
   * Climbing: 10 min warm-up -&gt; 30 min sub-limit bouldering -&gt; 1h limit bouldering (rest &gt;= 3min)
* Thursday: max hang in the morning, climbing in the afternoon
   * Climbing: 10 min warm-up -&gt; 30 min easy bouldering focusing on technique -&gt; \~45min threshold interval to train endurance/power-endurance
* Saturday: sport climbing on rocks if possible, otherwise similar to Tuesday (except for max hang)

Diet: Vegetarian, eat healthy food most of the time, \~3g creatine daily as supplement 

Sleep: Most days I manage to sleep 8 hours but I am a very light sleeper, so not sure how "good" my REM sleep is.
An interesting small dataset on strength data for elite climbers I recently stumbled across a livestream from a climbing comp back in August: [Beast Fingers Open Climbing Qualifiers](https://youtu.be/zVVMypktClQ). Interestingly, the comp included a portion where participants attempted (and received some points for?) various strength exercises. Information on the exact exercises is [here](https://beastfingersclimbing.com/2021-combine), and the results are [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TnumSst9NHPZqT0aXvOOsaGCkLhyRZ825o0OIQCJouA/edit?usp=sharing). Many of the participants are V10+ climbers and a few are V14-16 (Natalia Grossman and Drew Ruana).

A few observations that jumped out at me:

* Most of the men can do 20+ reps of a 115 lb bench, but not much more; most of the women max out at a few reps of a 90 lb bench
* Most of the men can do a 5s+ front lever, with a few posting really long (20s+) times, though the form in the video is somewhat lenient; the women peak at 2-3s
* Most of the men can do a few 1-arm pullups, a couple of them can do almost 10; women don't seem to have been tested on this
* Most of the men can do 10-20 pullups with +45 lbs; the women instead got tested at 1RM with weight, with most doing +50 - 70%
* The men are only slightly stronger than the women on "Grippul lift 20mm", peaking around 110% instead of 100%

There are other exercises that I omitted because they're unfamiliar ("flying ladder", "compression challenge"). There's probably a big grain of salt to be taken with something like the front lever numbers, where practicing the technique for a week would probably change their times drastically.  It's also unclear how hard people were trying. Still, a fun piece of data, and I bet other people can come up with more interesting analyses.
Developing technique for advanced climbers. (This might be beneficial for beginners as well) First i will start with where i am at and than i will proceed with some of my ideas of how i will try to up my technical game. At the end there will be some questions that I don't have the answer to (maybe some of you can help me, this will be appreciated). 

So now i am at the 8b (5.13d) route redpoint level. I have a solid pyramid in the lower grades with onsight up to 7b+ (5.12c). Bouldering wise outdoors i have done a 7b in 2-3 goes (close on the flash) and moonboard up to 7b. I go bouldering outdoors very rarely. 

I climb in an old school gym where there are only spray walls with very high diversity of holds and there are a bunch of people on my level and above. I climb not only mine boulders but also other's people inventions so that i can grasp a high level of movement diversity. 
Once i climb a certain boulder i don't just go to the next one but i try to find a better solution and climb it perfectly, focusing on different techniques like maintaining tension, flow, breathing or just being more precise with my feet.  

Of course as i want to improve my mindset has ever been that I have to climb boulders that aren't my style and attack weaknesses as much as possible. Before my weaknesses were obvious and it was easy to find them and train, but now it's kinda hard for me to find weaknesses in my climbing so it's going to be interesting for me to see what you do in this regard. 

Some weaknesses i have find:
I am a static climber. As i am fairly strong in the upper body muscles i usually try to lock off a move instead of generating momentum. I have been focusing on that in the past few months and have seen progress but it's interesting to me how to develop it even more as i have reached some sort of a platue in this regard. 

I am bad at staying close to the wall and i really don't know how to address that expect of actually trying to do that. 

Questions:
Since i have chosen the path of developing my technique i started to really focus on my movement on the wall. What i realized is that it's impossible for me to focus on my movement and at the same time try really hard, giving everything i have. Is this normal and if not how should i address it? 

Is it really possible to develop "perfect" technique in the gym that will transfer to the outdoors. Of course standing on small feet and some other things are generally only seen outdoors so it's hard to get better at them in the gym. But will quality of movement indoors transfer well outdoors? 

What are the things you have done in the past to develop your own technique?

Do you see any flaws in my approach and what? What can i do better?
Dave MacLeod's video on keto diet - a monumental effort! I am posting this more because I cannot believe the monumental effort that went into this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9dtfNZahKw&amp;t=579](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9dtfNZahKw&amp;t=579).  Dave truly puts his all into things and it is amazing that he is willing to give back to the climbing community in this way.  Haven't finished watching it but looking forward to digging in.  I am sure there will be some great takeaways even if I am not interested in doing the athletic Keto he mentions.
Day before climbing prep Does anyone have an opinion on the best things to do the day before climbing?

Best to rest, exercise of some form (what form), light climbing (bouldering), hang board?

If you have a day before ritual, what is it and why?
Scapula engagement while climbing Do you consciously engage your scapula when climbing?

It’s strange how most climbing technique advice don’t talk about the role of scapula engagement while moving on the wall. 

However as an experiment to myself, Im consciously putting in more effort to think about engaging my scapula and find myself gripping holds less hard and being more in control of my movement. 

I can do the same movements without thinking about my scapula at all but I find myself climbing less efficiently and I cannot believe that I’ve never noticed that until now. For background, i’m a V5-6 climber. 

For the better climbers out there, did you have to consciously engage your scapula especially when you just started out?
Deep breathing on sport climbs has drastically improved my endurance I always told myself that my main weakness was getting pumped on sport routes. Coming from a bouldering background, I could always do the moves fresh, but kept falling if I got to the crux while pumped. That is untill I started implementing deep breathing while climbing my projects. I'll explain how I use this. I learned this from a climbing coach a while ago, but it took a while to perfect. 

The exercise: ideally you want to find a rest in the middle of the route, or before the crux. It can be done on a shitty hold, but that will take some practice. Once you've arrived, alternate your hands and shake out/ chalk up. Start breathing deep and relatively fast. The tempo you're looking for is perfectly demonstrated by Wim Hof (the Ice/breath man https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybOi4hjZFQ).

Do this for 10 to 30 seconds, and you will literally feel your pump dissolving away. Your body will fill with energy and for me it was shocking how much psyche and confidence could be manifested mentally by doing this simple exercise. 

I urge everyone of you to try it out. Initially it was a bit uncomfortable, but familiarity with the exercise will make it more natural. I noticed that after the rest when you start climbing again, you can continue the exercise or just breath normally again. I do feel it takes away focus if you continue breathing like this.
How do you keep yourself reined in when feeling strong as fuck and psyched about it? What do you do when you can clearly see your training progress paying off, and suddenly your already rigorous training now has a big tank of psyche fueling it? I'm stoked about my progress and want to step it up, but also want to know what my current limits are... Please help me not get injured.
For those that can one arm hang the BM2K center edge, what grade do you climb? Just curious because most of the typical grade-to-max hang charts are with the standard 20 mm edge, but I believe the BM2000 center edge is a relatively “juggier” 22-23 mm.

Haven’t found much data out there specifically for this hold and 5-7 seconds max hangs.
Crusty trad dad looking for training advice to get out of the 5.10 plateau Hi r/climbharder! Long time lurker, first time poster here. I'm a crusty trad dad looking for some training advice.

**About me:**

I'm in my mid 30s living on the United States west coast. I have been trad climbing for about 12 years and I'm most psyched about big routes in the mountains. The vast majority of my climbing time are spent on multipitch and single pitch trad routes in the 5.7-5.10 range. 

I can generally onsight most 5.10- on gear comfortably, onsight some 5.10+ and redpoint some more after a try or two. My hardest onsight and redpoint are both 5.11a (single pitch trad). I have done many alpine rock routes, the Nose, RNWF of Half Dome and all that jazz. I rarely sport climb and basically never boulder outside. I climb in a bouldering gym once in a while but not consistently.

**Goals:**

I have come to the realization that I've been stuck in the 5.10 plateau for quite a few years now. Many of my remaining objectives are in the 5.11 range and I'd love to be able to comfortably onsight mid 5.11 and consistently redpoint 5.11+ on gear for those objectives.

**Questions:**

How do I break out of the 5.10 plateau? It seems like the obvious answers are to:

1. do some sort of projecting and grade pyramid (but what should I aim for?)
2. start sport climb and boulder more (does it translate to trad climbing? Or should I just stick with trad climbing?)
3. start training with some sort of plan (what kinda plan?)

I have never really trained before so I'm kinda clueless here, so any advice would be super appreciated!
Practical tendon strength and health advice from keith baar on science of ultra podcast tl: dr - Good podcast on how to keep tendons injury free. Podcast is for ultramarathon runners but still applicable to climbers [https://www.scienceofultra.com/podcasts/58](https://www.scienceofultra.com/podcasts/58)

Keith Baar is a pretty boss researcher re: connective tissue. He's published a bunch of papers including the one that Emil referenced in his 'hangboard training 2 times per day' video that was very popular here a few months ago ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBTI9qiH4UE&amp;t=236s&amp;ab\_channel=EmilAbrahamsson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBTI9qiH4UE&amp;t=236s&amp;ab_channel=EmilAbrahamsson))

This podcast is a few years old but has some very practical suggestions on how to reduce the likelihood of tendon injuries. I found that whilst I was aware of many of the concepts he talks about, this podcast ties them together better than most other sources I've come across.

Note: the start is very dry but it's worth pushing through to the training programming suggestions
Best climbing podcasts? It seems like there's been a lot of new climbing podcasts over the last few years. Which ones would you recommend and why? I'm going on a month long climbing trip by myself so I really appreciate your tips! I've already listened to everything from the power company climbing podcast by the way :)  


Edit:  
Wow thank you guys so much! Amazing. I won't get bored anytime soon ;)
Where to find extended videos of good climbers climbing So, over the last year I've been following bpump. Ogikubo, a Japanese climbing gym, on instagram. They frequently post videos of the routesetters sending newly set climbs, which has been extremely enlightening bc the Japanese climbing style is unusually poppy and dynamic. 

I've learned a lot of new moves through adding moves i see in their videos to my warm ups, but I've learned most of what i can learn at this point.

Anyone know what other instagram pages for gyms or pro climbers or youtube channels just have pure, well filmed, climbing movement? Not looking for something like mellow, bc theres a bit too much story and too little movement.

I like to watch the IFSC World cups for fun, but the movement is a bit too exaggerated and large to learn generally applicable principles for my climbing. 

In general, I'd like to have a decent coverage of all the big climbing nations on my insta, like the huge norway gyms, gyms in colorado, etc. Lmk what the right places to look are! I'm in particular interests in close up shots of climbing movement, preferring indoor bouldering. Not really interested in outdoor, scenic, or story driven videos for the purpose of this post :p

Random youtube videos I've liked:
https://youtu.be/sCi2vy5I9Rk jain kim in her home gym warming up. This was a pretty epic video for me to learn about what good, relaxed, gentle, momentum usage looks like. More relevant for sport climbing bc shes a sport climber.
Critique my climbing So outdoor season is over and I have 6 month ahead of me to train. I made good progress last year and I think some of the advice I got after posting a similar post last year helped.

Here's a few of the hard-to-me things I sent this year. I tried to find a variety of style, all videos are from first time sending so beta and everything isn't perfect, especially close to the top. Working on resending stuff more cleanly is probably something I should try.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neUz3n2mThk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neUz3n2mThk) Traverse with terrible feet

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSvTW9LvVf0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSvTW9LvVf0) Crimpy thing

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEwP\_8X3HfU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEwP_8X3HfU) Overhangy traverse 

Things I think I suck at and should work on :

Power/dynamic climbing. 

I could probably improve the precision of my footwork. I do the little bouncy feet thing when the foot is terrible and I'm not sure I can load it. It's gotten a lot better though

Steep climbing (not really shown in the video because there's barely any steep stuff outdoor around here)

There's nothing else that really jumps at me which is why I'm asking.
Long warmup to be able to access any forearm power Does it take anyone else a long time to warmup before being able to generate any power in your forearms?

When I first touch a hangboard I can't hang 20mm (I can literally barely take my feet off the floor). After progressively warming up over 30-40 minutes I can hang 20mm for over 20 seconds which is such a stark difference. The increase in my power over the warmup is generally pretty slow as well, where I have to pull on very large rungs several times with good breaks to even get my feet off the ground on 20mm. I also train with a friend who can pull his max force after almost no warmup. 

Another interesting thing is that my friend burns out quickly and has very limited good attempts whereas I run for much longer once I am warm. It seems like I'm naturally suited more for endurance than strength. 

Just interested to see if anyone else out there is similar or has experience with this. Cheers.
Is it possible to learn how to climb elegantly? I have been climbing for a few years and recently noticed something in the way myself and a few other climbers move that is actually quite hard to describe: even when successfully sending a route/problem, well, the ascent doesnt *look* good.

It's difficult for me to put my finger on exactly what feels wrong; it seems like a combination of lack of flow, saggy lower body, pulling harder than one needs to (basically brute forcing every move) and general awkwardness going up the wall. I guess my first question is if anyone can help me pinpoint what exactly I mean lol.[someone climbing awkwardly ](https://youtu.be/VOn8WtjI3hQ)

There are plenty of super strong climbers -- particularly indoors -- that manage to draw on their power to climb hard (nothing wrong with that by the way). I wonder if being technical and smart about body positioning is actually equivalent to climbing elegantly though? can that alleviate some of the stress that climbing hard inflicts on your body?[example of elegant climbing ](https://youtu.be/6ybn3GangdM)
Where does each training board shine? (kilter, moon, tension) What would you say is the purpose of each of the training boards (kilter, moon, tension)? Also at what angle do you think the tension and kilter boards shine the best?
Does anybody know why Magnus has bigger muscles compared to your average pro climber? Does he lift weights often or is it simply genetics? I'm asking because that's my dream physique since I hate being the stereotypical "skinny" climber.
The biggest blocker I have is that I don't have reliable partners or a climbing clique/group; how can I find that in a COVID-19 America? I've been climbing for six years but have never been part of a group. I have been the "side piece" for a couple climbers with regular groups, but they never bring me into their inner circle. I really enjoy rock climbing and have even built a home wall, so it's frustrating that I don't have people I can reliably climb with. I get outdoors only once or twice a quarter while I'm someone's belay side piece.

In theory the gym is the place to meet people but I've never been able to make a relationship happen in the gym. I have made acquittances outside the gym who happen to be members, but for whatever reason they never bring me along to their trips to Smith Rock even when we were hitting up the gym together every week and I'd directly state interest in joining them on a trip. 

I think I treat people well (compliment their technique, bring food on outings, don't shy from setting routes, avoid talking about politics or sensitive issues), but if I've encountered failure this long, perhaps there's just something fundamentally off with me. I went to therapy to try and figure that out, but my therapist said that I appeared socially normal and my negative feelings were more likely just due to low self-esteem.

I live in Portland, which is notoriously difficult to socially penetrate. People are generally very reluctant to bring people into their friend groups/cliques. So that might be part of the issue. When I lived in Germany this summer for work I quickly found people in the gym who invited me out every weekend. But when you're the foreigner in a town it's easier to stand out. I know people who've moved here to Portland who found their group in a months. So it's not impossible, but it appears to be that way for me.

Now with COVID it feels even harder to make connections in the gym. We have to be spaced out and masked. All but one of my acquittances have moved out. I mostly boulder and auto-belay since people rarely show up with climbing gear alone at my gym (most of the singles just boulder).

I really love climbing, but it's frustrating to spend this many years running up against a wall where I can't advance because I can't regularly get outdoors. Hopefully the community here can help me figure out what I need to change:

* How did y'all find your groups/reliable partners?

* How do you meet climbers in a COVID-19 gym and grow that into a reliable climbing pal?

* What social subtleties may I have been missing that have kept me from being part of the climbing community?

Thanks for reading my trite whining and hopefully I'll gain some advice that'll lead to me being able to climb harder.
(When) Does training actually work? I (M 35) recently send a few of my hardest ever sport climbs. Both red points and onsights ( 7a-7b+(5.12a-5.12c). Not just one, but a few climbs that went down without much difficulty. Felt pretty confident that with proper projecting, I could send at least 1-2 grade harder) At the same time (the past few months), I have been working hard at the desk and not once set foot in the gym. Essentially I wanted to prioritise outside sport when I had any time at all. My thinking was that I was probably fairly strong and only spending time on the rock made me able to profit from the strength gained during bouldering season/gym and hence the sending.

The past week I have come back to the gym and I am weak AF. Could not even get close to sending the indoor grades I did a while back. I could not send anything on the moonboard.

Now I am wondering whether (in my grade range) there is much to gain from training indoors at all? Are we all delusional, when we hangboard, moonboard and pull on plastic? Would I be just as fine taking a walk on the beach, saving the juice for the weekend? Granted if I want to be good at indoor bouldering, indoor bouldering will help. But If I want to climb hard(er) outside, does it actually work at all?

So my question to the crushers: Why do i send more when not training, not climbing that much and obviously getting weaker? At which point does training work? What is your experience?

TLDR: I am weaker, why do I climb stronger? Does training actually work?
Best fingerboard protocol for injury prevention? Looking for something I can do once a week that will help prevent finger injuries. My normal training consists of short (90min) 40degree board sessions. With two days rest in between. I want to add a FB session on one of those rest days. Ideally this FB session will have as little effect on those board sessions as possible in terms of fatigue etc. 
My initial thoughts were something like warming up to a max hang, then 1 max hang and finish. 
Or warming up then 2/3 30sec density style hangs. 
Of course any ‘accidental’ strength gains are welcomed ;) 

(Disclaimer - Never been a fan of repeaters) 

Thoughts people?
Help Me Learn How to Use The Spray Wall Please Hi,

I used to go to a gym where there were grade-marked pre-set boulders but I switched to a new gym (where I was climbing around V4) with basically only various degree angle spray walls. I am enjoying it a lot more but I feel a bit lost too. Either the stuff that I do on the spray wall is too comfortable or absolutely impossible. I am a bit shy as well so I find it difficult to talk to people to ask for boulder problems. How do I get better at utilizing the spray wall? I feel like half of my training is being wasted trying to figure out what I can/cannot do. And when the gym is more crowded, I kinda shy into a few boulders that I am working on and that's about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a systematic way to work on the spray wall or should I just keep going at it until I figure it out? Please don't say 'Talk to other people.' I find this very difficult mostly because they are all so much better than me and even when they give me boulders, they are practically impossible.
Moving somewhere with zero climbing. How to maintain? In January I’m moving to Dar Es Salaam, which has no climbing gyms and no nearby rock climbing. Sigh. I’ll only be there for a year, and I think importing holds for a home board would be expensive, so I’ll have to make do with more portable training tools (I have a Tension Flash Board, a Lattice pinchblock, and Metolius Rock Rings) to maintain my finger fitness. Wondering what is the best approach: (A) max hangs (for pure strength) followed by low-intensity repeaters (for aerobic capacity), or (B) simply higher intensity (~70% of max) repeaters? I find hangboarding very sad and boring so I will probably manage two sessions a week and no more. Obviously I will also use this time to work on general fitness (core, shoulders, etc.).

I’m mainly a route climber with trad and sport objectives. I will be able to do the occasional climbing trip in the region, and will probably mainly pursue easier mountain routes (e.g. Mount Kenya), but I’m also keen to hit, say, Table Mountain in Capetown, where there is more stuff near my limit. Would also love to hit Rocklands for bouldering but seems like it would be a waste of a trip given how rusty my power and technique will be. 

I guess my main goal to avoid losing too much finger fitness for when my time in Dar is over and I’ll have more access to climbing. Hoping to actually improve during this time seems foolish.
This may have been asked before, but what are some habits I should get into/things I should know while I am still relatively new to climbing (a year or two)? [removed]
What drills helped you keep your hips to the wall? Hi,

V5/6ish climber here. When ever I watch videos of my self climbing I notice my hips are quite far from the wall.  I’ve been working on mobility but am keen to hear what drills I can Incorporate at the start of every session to drill it into my body.

Any help is hugely appreciated!
Why is indoor climbing so hard? I climb reasonably well on rock and have tried/projected routes up to 7c+ in various styles. Scary, runout slabs and poorly protected climbs are my strongest styles but I've done loads of overhanging sport routes too. And I don't think I'm a terrible indoor boulderer as I've done 10+ V6 and V7 benchmarks on the Moonboard. 

But I find indoor route climbing absolutely impossible. The holds are greasy, the footholds super slippery, I can't understand the beta, I can't find good rests and the clipping positions and holds are always bad. Sometimes I even get scared and grab the quickdraws because I can't clip! Is this how indoor climbers feel when they go outside?

I really don't mind being a bad indoor climber. But I'm starting to wonder if this is a sign of some actual flaw in my climbing. I'd like to believe that my technique, pacing and lack of fear of falling are at least acceptable. So maybe I actually have extremely poor endurance? 

Has anyone had the same experience, and was able to improve their performance on rock by actually climbing more indoors?
I know grades can be meaningless but this was such a personal triumph today. Grateful for online climbing communities that share my passion and inspire me to be stronger.
Is it normal to "not learn" from some of your climbs? Ok, that's a weird question and maybe even a stupid one but let me tell you my story and, hopefully, it will make more sense.

There is this problem at my gym that is quite technical on a 5deg overhang wall that is comprised of some dual-texture prisms and weird footholds. About 1-2 months ago I projected it for 3 sessions until I finally figured out the correct beta, which allowed me to send it. Afterward, the problem became quite easy for me and I would "flash" it at the beginning of every follow-up session I had. After 3-4 sessions doing it, I moved on... This week (after a bit more than a month without trying it), I tried and failed miserably. Tried again on the next session and, despite good improvement, failed again.  To be honest, I'm not sure if I'm using 100% the same beta as before but it is quite close.

So, despite this being really depressing, is this something that I should expect sometimes, or am I doing something wrong in my training?

Things that I wondered about:

* Climbing is very specific and I "lost it" because I was training different types of problems.
   * If that is the case, how do I manage to better retain the learnings?
* Maybe it is just a matter of using exactly the same beta as before
   * I'll start recording all my climbs to be sure
* The holds were pretty new when I tried and, maybe, now they are sleekier/smoother so the problem is actually harder
   * I can't say for sure
* Maybe my grip got weaker?
   * Don't think so since I was sending harder stuff on moonboard
Two questions about beginner training programs **Are there any 'standardized' training programs for beginners?**

I come from the strength training world, where we have quite a few tried-and-true standard training programs that are well known and vetted by the community.  Examples are: Stronglifts 5x5, Starting Strength, many others, and even the standard BWF beginners routine from /r/bodyweightfitness.  I imagine there are several of these commonly accepted standard routines in the climbing world for beginners, hoping to learn which ones are out there so I can research them and educate myself!  **Just to clarify:** looking for a **climbing** program that's *structured* like those examples (prescriptive, progressive), not a strength program to do alongside climbing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is the climbing community familiar with '**[**grease the groove**](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/09/bro-do-you-even-grease-the-groove/598837/)**', and are there any established training programs that leverage that thinking?**

I've seen the most progress in my strength training from GtG, and it seems like it would port well to developing strength and endurance for climbing/bouldering.  Wondering if there's any prior art here, or if I'm in the wild west/DIY world for a program like this.? (for those who want to save a click, GtG is basically working out in smaller, but more frequent chunks, rather than one large one, and then scaling up the intensity of those smaller chunks over time.  Example: 2 pullups every hour of the day for a week, then increase to 3, then 4, etc.  It can be adapted for any movement, and can scale for reps, intensity, TuT, whatever you want)

Thank you!

EDIT #1: while continuing to research, I found this: [https://eveningsends.com/five-minute-fingers/](https://eveningsends.com/five-minute-fingers/).  While this is just a hangboard routine, not a full climbing routine, its worth noting that this is similar to what I'm referring to, and is out there.

EDIT #2:: thanks to  /u/solotigre, here's a link to a concept that's very close to what's being described in the OP.  [https://www.climbstrong.com/education-center/quantifying-bouldering-sessions/](https://www.climbstrong.com/education-center/quantifying-bouldering-sessions/) .  The only thing missing is putting togehter a program (schedule) around those kinds of measurements.

&amp;#x200B;
5.12 gym lead climbers, what would you say played the largest factor in you breaking into that grade. So I have been seeing pretty solid improvement in my lead climbing at the gym. I’ve spent a fair amount of 11s and some 11+ and want to push into 12s. My question is what we’re some of the biggest contributing factor for you finally sending  and breaking 5.12. I know some with say just climb more but I’m sure there are other nuggets of wisdom out there.
I'm always jittering when I climb Hey r/climbharder,

i started bouldering around 4-5 years ago (except for a 6 months break, because of a ruptured ACL), and have seen steady improvements over the years.  
Recently I climbed my first 7C outdoors, and have managed to climb many boulders in the 7A to 7B+ range.  
But one thing that has not changed since I started with bouldering, is that I jitter when I climb.  


It doesn't matter if it's  an easier juggy problem, or a crimpy overhanging one. There also doesn't seem to be any kind of correlation between the muscles, or body parts, that are trembling. Sometimes it's my forearms, sometimes my triceps, sometimes the legs. That also leads to the fact that I don't like how I look while climbing, everything looks extremely hard, even if it isn't. And it often looks like I'm about to fall, even when I actually feel quite secure on a hold/move.  


I had the feeling that it has gotten better over the years, but the last three or four session were actually quite depressing regarding the jittering.  


I also don't have any Idea where I should actually start to finally do something about it.  
Get more into strength-training? Up my mental game?  
Has anyone be bothered by similar problems?
Have you made big flexibility gains? Hi everyone, 

I’m curious to hear anecdotes from anyone that has made big gains in their flexibility (including active ROM; I don’t want to get into a flexibility vs. mobility debate), and how these gains have affected their climbing.

It’s not uncommon to hear about people doing a hangboard cycle and seeing their grade go up, but it’s not nearly as common to hear about people making big gains in flexibility and how these have affected their climbing ability. 

Anyone here that has devoted a significant amount of focused time (say 6+ months) to improving their flexibility for climbing? 

Anyone gone so far as to train long-term to get the splits? Do you consider it worth it?

Thanks for your input!
Train like a dumbass - January Challenge January is a shit month for climbing locally.  Too cold, too wet, and anywhere dry is too far.  It's doable, but you have to be a stubborn asshole, with too much time.  I'm a stubborn asshole, but short on time.  So January is the perfect time to get rekt before the spring climbing season starts.    


Dan John has popularized a kettle bell challenge called the [10,000 swing challenge](https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/the-10000-swing-kettlebell-workout/).  Pretty straight forward.  you do 10k reps over 20-something days.  Get fit, get strong.  Cool.  


In January, I'm going to do the 10k swing challenge.  I'm going to pair it with 10,000 seconds of deadhangs.  And I'm gonna ARC an Everest (29,032 ft).  In 20 active days, hopefully in less than 25 total days.  

  
The plan!

* Morning swings + hangs - 6am
   * 25 sets of 20 swings, 20" hang on a 20mm edge, a few pullups
   * Rest \~2 minutes, basically a new round starts every 3 minutes, on the minute
   * this takes 90 minutes, with warmups
* Evening - 4pm
   * ARC.  Should be 24 pitches per day, in the gym, 60ft walls.  Autobelay.  Headphones.  
   * This takes 75 minutes.

Goals:  None.  This is not training.  This is dumb shit to prove a point to myself.  I expect it will be great for body composition, good for aerobic fitness for climbing, no idea what will happen with finger strength.  Looking forward to climbing 5.10 in gloves because jug rash and swings have killed my hands.  #SponsorMeRhinoSkin  


Do it with me!  Or not.  Or try the hangs.  But mostly, don't be afraid to do dumb shit in your training.  The worst case scenario is you'll learn something.  New Years Resolution: for this to be the dumbest thing I do in 2022.
Dedicating a month or two exclusively for strength training? Is it beneficial and how to do it? Starting with the usual who i am and what are my weaknesses: 

I am climbing for 4 years now, i have climbed up to 8b redpoint, 7b+ onsight, having a solid pyramid of 250 routes between 6b and 8a on different styles and rock types. I have been climbing for 3-5 days a week for the past 3 years, being very consistent and mindful about my training. 

My weaknesses are finger strength and upper body power. I am fairly strong in my upper body, doing pull ups with 190%BW and being able to do a few one armers. However i am barely able to do a 1-4-7 on the campus board, maybe even 1-4-6. On a 20mm edge i can hang for 7 seconds with 145%BW with two arms, which is considered low for the grade i climb (lattice said that). My technique is okay, of course i am always trying to improve it, having not been satisfied with it for the past years, but now i can really speak to myself that i have improved and finally i am satisfied with how i move on the wall. 
Tactics, finding sneaky rests and route reading are also okay for my level i think. 

So in the past i have always been climbing a lot, a lot. Putting in everything i can to maximize learning and so on. But my main weakness now is finger strength and power as i said and although I have tried to address that in the past it haven't been successful just because i have always been distracted with climbing and usually skipping the campus board and the hangboard and going straight to the climbing wall. 

I have decided to make a change and try to address that with lowering the climbing volume i do and putting in the effort into real and consistent strength training. But i was wondering if this will really be beneficial and translate well into climbing? I know that it's possible to get stronger and at the same time not see any improvement on the rock, just because i have forgotten to climb, so i will try to avoid that with getting enough high quality climbing. But what is enough? I am used to climbing tired sometimes, but i know that won't be in any benefit to getting stronger. Should i really go to the gym when i am 100% recovered? How much time is enough to make a descent progress onto the campus board? Tell me how often you go the the campus board and how much time you spend on it. What about the length of the cycle? I am thinking that 1 month won't be enough for proper gains so maybe 2? To those that have done something like this in the past, was that beneficial for you, do you think it will be beneficial for me?
Resting on sport routes Hi, got some questions about how to get better at resting on sport routes. People often talk about how finding good rests is crucial to improving. But I always find it hard to find a good rest, unless it's an obvious spot with good feet and barely any hands needed. Part of my difficulty is I often don't know if any given rest is actually making things worse or better. I've heard you have to spend some time on any given rest to evaluate if it's actually helping, but I don't know how long. Would love some insight on some questions:

1. Any key tips for identifying a good rest?
2. How long do you stay on a rest? Two sub-questions here: first, how long should you persist with the rest before you are able to evaluate whether it's helping or not?
3. Second, if it's a good rest, how long should you stay on? Do you try to milk as much as you can, ie until other parts of your body (eg legs) fatigue?
4. What is your usual shaking technique/rhythm? Is it better to alternate hands quickly or slowly?
5. Is it always best to rest with straight arms? In some positions, I feel a passive straight arm hang results in hips away from the wall and less weight on my feet. Meanwhile using my lower body/core to bring my hips in over my feet can require more engagement too from my upper body (arms, shoulders, etc).
6. Do you find it more effective to rest long on really good rests, or to try to find frequent but less optimal shorter rests? (Obviously considerations such as where the pumpy or crux sections are will come into play too?)
7. Are there any good strategies to intentionally practice/improve at resting? Or is it just climb more, and trial and error?

For background info: I've been climbing lead indoors about 4 months, redpointing most Australian 21s (\~5.11b) in a single session Bouldered for 1.5 years, V4 is comfortable and often flashed, project grade is around V6. So at my lead grade, rarely are individual moves or sections very difficult for me. It's usually the endurance that gets me, and I feel I'm terrible at resting.
Best at home core workouts for overhang ! Getting a pull-up bar for Christmas so I’d appreciate to utilize it. I have a pretty strong core but I’d like to really push my self further into stuff that’s going to “ruin” me when it comes to difficulty and what I’m getting out of it. Unfortunately this is all at home so the most I have ⠀is said pull-up bar. Currently I do some ground workouts for 15 min. Stuff like lemon squeezers, crunches, hollow bodies, etc.. Anyway, I’m getting more into outdoor stuff and there is a noticeable need for more core strength when it comes to most of the harder climbs that I really wanna do, so anything helps. Thank you!
Anyone else who plateued at a really low level for a very long time? I am just wondering if I am the only one. I guess that most other people who are not improving probably quit, so the likelyhood of one of them being here is probably low :)

I started climbing abut 9-10 years ago (I was 33 years old). After a couple of of years I started to boulder almost exclisively. I have mostly been climbing a couple of times a week, up to three times a week in my «good» periods.

I have never reached past v2-v3.

I am average height/weight (180cm, 72kg). I am not very strong, but I can do 7-8 pull ups, I can hang from a 18cm edge with 8kg added for 10 sec.

I spend most of my time climbing stuff that is a bit to hard for me, using several tries to solve them (some times I never solve them)

I have tried a lot of stuff to improve: looking at youtube, reading books, gone to several bouldering group lessons, hiring a coach, posting videos here. I get feedback that I think helps (at the time), but I am still not able to reach higher grades.

I guess I just have a real lack of talent when it comes to climbing, and I have mostly come to terms with that. I still mostly enjoy it, and find it to be a good workout. However, I was just curious if am unique in my talentlessness :)
What to look for in a climbing coach? Hi,

I'm at that stage in my climbing career where I think I'd like some professional guidance on how best to improve.

I've been climbing for 3 years.  I feel that I'm decent at strength training and understanding how to train for strength but I absolutely suck at training technique and identifying my technique weaknesses.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've never used a coach or searched for a coach before. Should I only use a coach at my local gym? How often should I see them? What are some green flags for a great coach? What are some red flags? etc

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!
I am a 5’3 female v6/v7 boulderer and I’ve been stuck at a plateau for a year. Does anyone have any goal ideas or training workouts to try? I’ve been stuck here for about a year and am anxious to move on and send v7 consistently (at this point, I’ve sent one soft v7). I climb a lot and still seem to stay at the same place.
I don’t workout consistently, though I am trying to get intro a MWF routine. 
If anyone has any ideas, let me know
Injured again and I want to give up For context, I've been climbing regularly about 3 years. For 2 of those, I've constantly battled minor but persistent pulley injuries in the middle and ring fingers of both hands. I am not a skinny person so my fingers have a ways to go to be as strong as they need to be. There has never been a clear "moment" of finger injury for me - I am always surprised when it comes on.

In July I was climbing my best ever. I took about a month off in August after straining my finger in the gym, but mostly because I was orchestrating moving across the country. 

I slowly got back in the gym in the fall, for about 6 weeks before I overdid it and went to the gym 3 days in a row. I tore some connective tissue in the back of my wrist (there was a "pop"). This was the scariest injury I've ever had, but it healed remarkably well over the first couple weeks. I started weight training again to fill the void, and worked in some easy hangboarding to try and keep my fingers in shape. I was wary of easing back into it since I know people get hurt returning to their former volume too quickly.

After 4 weeks sidelined by the wrist injury, I returned to gym 2 weeks ago stoked as ever. The wrist is mostly OK it's just sore on pushing moves (think dips) and on big slopers, so I can avoid those.
I was climbing at a slightly lower level than before but was just happy to be back. I taped my middle fingers because I'd had some issues with them in the summer. 

I guess my ring finger was sore my last session, because I remember taping it and then climbing normally. But today it's way more sore, again, and I can no longer try hard. I think I made it 6 sessions. 

I may try and do a dedicated training cycle focusing on hanging ~~pockets~~ big edges and weightlifting. It feels stupid to go back to hard climbing if my fingers are so fragile. I just want to try hard and it feels like shit that I can't

Thanks for reading the rant if you made it this far. Keep crushing hope your luck is better than mine

TLDR I have no idea how to balance training volume for getting better vs. staying healthy

edit: thank you to everyone who replied

edit 2: interesting how some folks are so against hangboarding for finger injuries while others advocate it
Guide for kids that wanna free long routes and do other stuff good too So this is a bit of a different kind of a post, less training and more tactics, but it might help some people who, like me, are more interested in long free routes than boulders or single pitch sport climbs. This list of tactics is also definitely a work in progress, and I don’t do all of these things all of the time, but I have used all of these at different times, and they really help. Some of these seem like common sense, but still worth mentioning.

Bringing stuff on the route:

* Don’t wear a pack if you can help it. Wearing a pack, especially on vertical or steeper terrain sucks and puts more strain on your upper body than necessary. Haul the damn thing if it’s hard or steep.
Hauling can happen with a thin tag line (I typically use the Edelrid II rap line) or even the lead line. I’ll get into the latter method later.

* Another thing with tag lines: if the pitch is long and requires a large rack, or has a hard crux towards the bottom, start the pitch with just enough pieces to get to a rest or stance, and then haul the rest of the rack for the second part of the pitch. 

* One last thing with twisty tag lines, mini packable reusable shopping bags make great rope bags at hanging belays or during rappels. 

* Use a microtraxions, or even two, to haul. Hang one microtraxion off the anchor, and clove it to a carabiner on your harness and squat. The other method is stomping in a sling to haul it, hanging the sling from a microtraxion, a tibloc, or even an autoblock. I tend to do the squat haul and just take one micro.

* Instead of a normal pack I use a little haul pack. Everything you’d normally carry in a pack goes in this bag. On low angle pitches the follower wears it as a pack, on steep or crux pitches it gets hauled (basically anything over 5.9) I've used both a BD Creek 20 and a Metolius Express Haulpack.

* Sometimes bringing two pairs of shoes is worth it. Have floppies with socks for all the 5.10 climbing, then bust out the tap dancers for the 5.12 face pitch, or whatever.

Partner tactics:

* Lead in blocks that make sense. Do transitions at ledges if possible. There’s a lot of pros to block leading, including keeping people warmer (you’re at belays for a shorter time), and being able to stay in one headspace for a while. 

* Play to strengths. If one person is more likely to send the one crux pitch on lead, the other person’s job is to free everything to get them there. Alternatively, for multiple cruxes, match strengths with leaders. If one partner is better at thin cracks, and the other is a stronger face climber, match them up.

All day comfort:

* Eat and drink more regularly than you think. It’s easy (for me anyway) to forget to eat until I’m starving when I climb, so shove some snacks in a pocket to eat while the other person is climbing. 

* If there’s gonna be a lot of hanging belays, consider bringing a belay seat. [Fish makes one](http://fishproducts.com/catalog/gear_slings.html) that packs down to the size of a lime and will save your ass. I’ve also used other things, like an old pack frame sheet with webbing punched through it, as a belay seat. At least bring an aider to either step in, or to wrap around your ass. Even a cordalette or rope tied into loops for seat or stirrups can help take pressure off hips.

* Volleyball kneepads are goddamn lifesavers if you’re going to encounter chimneys or offwidths. Your kneecaps won’t look like old bacon at the end of the day if you take these.
Take your shoes off at belays. Duh.

Preparation tactics:

* If the approach is strenuous, stash the rack, water, etc. at the base of the route 2 days prior to climbing. You’ll sleep better if you can sleep in a bed (or van or whatever), and you’ll be less tired from the approach. (MAKE SURE STASHING IS LEGAL ON THE LAND YOU’RE CLIMBING ON)

* Don’t stash food. Critters will eat it, and it’s usually illegal anyway.

* Do your homework. Unless you’re going for a pure onsight attempt, glean any beta you can from other folks who’ve done it. Know where the cruxes are, what the best rack is, where the comfy ledges are, and the descent.

* Time cruxes with sun/shade if you can. You can make a route plan with the [munter method](https://muntercalculation.com/). Adapt it to climbing via 45 min/pitch to lead and follow (30 if it’s an easy pitch), 1 hour for crux pitches, 15 minutes per rappel.  

* Take a goddamned wag bag. Don’t release the mud falcon of doom on some unsuspecting party.

[Friends don’t let friends belay:](https://www.climbing.com/skills/advanced-techniques-follow-on-toprope-solo/)

Ok so here’s where things get weird and techy. Me and most of my climbing partners have and still do a lot of top rope soloing, so we are quite comfortable with the systems. There’s a lot of ways to do it, and I’m not going to go into every way to do it, but I use either two microtraxions, or one microtraxion and a trango vergo, and a bungee because it’s pretty light and redundant. We use this to follow most pitches because it saves the leader from having to belay, which is tiring, and saves everyone from having to stack ropes.

So, the system goes like this:

1. Leader leads

2. Leader gets to top of pitch, builds anchor, and fixes the rope.

3. Follower top rope solos the pitch and cleans it.

4. Follower gets to the anchor and clips in to anchor.

5. Follower takes off microtraxion, clips it to anchor, and inserts the rope into the mixrotraxion so rope can be pulled up through it.

6. Leader reracks and begins leading. Follower consistently pulls only enough rope through pulley to have enough to belay leader.

So the rope is just dangling down. This system doesn’t work great with long traverses, or if it’s really windy, so you can easily switch to belaying normally if it makes sense to. I used to mostly use two microtraxions, [but now use a microtraxion and a Trango Vergo, as it lets me lower or give myself slack easily.](https://sicgrips.blogspot.com/2020/08/vergo-for-top-rope-soloing.html)

 One variation of this is that the follower can hang the haul bag from the rope to both provide enough weight that the rope feeds easily through microtraxions, and then you just haul the bag up once the follower is at the anchor. This might involve stacking the rope, but it’s just a trade off.

There's a bunch of ways to manage this stuff, but these tips have helped me redpoint long multi pitch routes up to 1500' long. Much of this is tailored to the stuff that I climb, but I'd love to hear other tactics people have used for longer routes to improve my game.
Climbing harder as I am getting older? I am in my early 50s, been climbing for about 40 years but only recently started trying to climb harder. I got up my first few V7s at the age of 47 and sent my first V10 this year (probably soft with my beta). It would be nice to solidify at the grade as well as build a nice pyramid below the level.

In terms of training, I do bouldering sessions 2-3 times a week and do some low-volume finger work daily. My bouldering sessions are outside when the weather is permitting, but I do have a training wall installed in my house for rainy days. Plus, I do shoulder rehab and light opposition work every other day. Once a week I try to go for a recovery run (also to make my cardiologist happy).

My finger strength is mediocre, I tend to open-hand/drag even on holds that require crimping. The strengths are body-tension, footwork and compression. The weaknesses are outright dynamic movement and shoulder opposition (right shoulder has been injured, so I try to avoid dynos or gastons to that side). My recovery times after hard sessions are rather long, so projecting interferes with training a bit.

I'm looking for some ideas how to keep improving as I am getting older. It would be especially nice to hear from older climbers that found some tricks in terms of training, nutrition or recovery.

Thank you all in advance.

PS. Someone sent me a message asking what I do for daily hang boarding and how I structure my bouldering sessions. I am trying to be process oriented yet flexible at the same time - so I keep a journal but don't plan ahead.

For hang boarding, I've found that doing very light multiple hangs conditions my tendons and pulleys as well as makes me stronger. I generally do 10 sec hangs at 60-80% of BW depending on the grip (usually try to do full "training" crimp on 15mm, chisel and drag on 20mm) and do them anywhere from 20 to 40 hangs through the day. It's literally that every time I pass under my hang board I think about how my fingers feel and do a 10 second hang edge with my feet on a small ledge.

For "programming" my bouldering sessions I kinda try to evaluate how my body feels from the last session, overall health and my level of motivation.  So I decide on either a volume session (walk around doing/trying problems that's on the easier side), a weakness session (picking problems that I know will require doing stuff I suck at) or a projecting session (trying to get on problems that are a bit above my pay grade). Another factor is the weather and my posse - if the guys are going climbing, I'll try to join and get on things but try as hard as my state of recovery allows. Same for the weather - if the weather is great now with a week of rains ahead, but I am crunchy all over, I might go out for a volume session and do weakness session on the home wall next day or day after. Overall, I usually know the answer in the morning and sometimes I only understand what to do as I start warming up.
Core: Volume vs. Intensity In terms of increasing overall core strength, e.g. improving body tension on steep rock, do you prioritize volume or intensity?

If anyone has any experience with front levers and how they correlate with steep climbing, please share :)
Short women's advice for breaking into 5.13 As the title suggests, I am a short woman :) I have been climbing the past decade or so and made a lot of progress over the years from crippling fear of heights to my first pull-up to some sends I'm really proud of. Having achieved my goals for this year, I'd like to focus on two new ones:

1. Onsight low-end 5.12 in my anti-style
2. Send 13a

As of now, I can send 12+ but can hardly top the 13- climbs I’ve tried (probably flailed up about 5 now). **Looking for advice on where to focus my training this winter in hopes of onsighting steep 12a this spring and finally breaking through the 5.13 barrier next fall (or reverse order).**

**Stats:**

* Can send 5.12c/d routes that emphasize technical skill, most in a single session.
* Onsight up to 12b technical / 11d thuggy / 11b truly steep.
* I can do 10 strict pull-ups at max effort and 5 strict push-ups at max effort.
* I have a small frame, I’m pretty light (but a healthy female BMI of 19), and I have more crimp strength than I know what to do with. 
* Most likely scenario to fall: locking off on big open-hand grips on steeps or open-handed, powerful underclings.
* I see the advice to increase outdoor mileage often on this sub so it’s worth mentioning that I averaged 4.4x week outside this year so I'm probably getting plenty of volume.
* This might be totally mental but it feels like I get shut down by my height more and more as I climb harder--is this a thing others have observed?

**If you’re a lady (especially a short one) who has broken through to 5.13, what did you focus on to get there?** Things I'm thinking about are core strength, maybe some campusing, sloper training on a hangboard, simple bouldering, something targeting biceps...

I hate overly complex training plans and I prefer to focus on 2-3 areas that maximize impact, thus the desire for a really targeted approach!
Board Climbing vs. Weighted Resistance Training for improving climbing ability on overhangs. Hey y'all! I'm a v5-6 climber in central NY. 

After an awesome outdoor trip, I'm planning a 3 month structured training cycle to prepare for outdoor bouldering in the spring.

 I can consistently climb v7-8 on climbs with less than a 20* overhang, but only v5-6 on serious overhangs. I've also found through weigh training that I have significantly lower lock-off and crimp strength than other climbers around my grade.

For my training, I have use of a Moon Board(40*), Tension Board (30*), campus board, and a gym with hangboard/equipment for weighted pull-ups. 

I want to focus on improving my steep climbing, which heavily involves lock offs and crimp strength. How much time should I devote to the boards vs. gym exercises?

Pro for boards: Somewhat similar in movement to climbing. More fun/motivating. Greater variety of movement.

Pro for gym exercises: Can more efficiently exercise specific muscles. 

I think I'm going to spend about 75% of my training time on the boards, but I'm curious how you would divide your training time between these implements.
How to get better at high underclings? I'm trying to break into gym V7's this year, and on 2 of the recent ones that I've tried (and I'm sure that this beta is correct because I worked with other people that have similar height/reach) I've failed to make individual moves that require establishing tension using a high (but positive) crimp undercling. In these instances, the underclings were either face-level or above on a gently overhanging wall, and both times followed that move off the high undercling with getting your feet high and "standing up" to make the undercling better, then blasting to something kind of far away. 

I feel my weakness on this specific hold position is due to weakness in my wrist just below my hand. Typically, I find that I can use my larger forearm muscles to control holds but because of the position on these, I can't activate those bigger muscles because my wrist is seemingly at an awkward angle when I get into the hold.

How did you get better a high underclings? are there any technical tricks other than like the obvious higher feet? If I wanted to improve wrist strength for this, how might I do that?
Working a manual job for “cross training” I’m a college student right now and I want to make good use of my next summer and the possible next lockdown to improve my climbing. Last summer I worked a moving job carrying furniture and I felt it greatly improved my overall shape. Notably, lower back, core, and grip endurance. Lots of awkward grip positions and basically doing farmers carrys. 

Is working a part time manual job going to improve my training or will it just lead to unnecessary injury risk? Any recommendations for types of manual work which would pay well and improve my climbing shape?
How to structure training if I can only climb 3 subsequent days of the week? I want to climb 3x per week but I feel like my lack of recovery/possible overtraining is impeding my progress. How do I structure my training if I can only climb Mon/Tue/Wed? I have access to a hangboard and a pull-up bar at home every day of the week. I am having problems structuring my training such that I can climb hard/put in maximal effort three days in a row and train muscular/finger strength simultaneously (during the rest of the week). I just feel spent after Monday and feel like I'm actually regressing rather than progressing. Thanks!
Any advice for getting the last bit of pull-through on 1-5-9(jugs)? I'm also not sure how to translate it to the crimps. I can 1arm the lattice 20mm and do 1-5-8 on jugs, but can't do 1-5-8 on crimps. The pull through feels so much harder on crimps.
Older climbers - how do you maintain/increase your “spring”? Quite an abstract idea here but as I’m getting older I find I have less ability to pull suddenly and strong. I’m not even sure if that the right way to word it but basically my “springiness” is going.

Any tips on how to get this back or at least maintain it? I’ve found when I’m running more I feel more explosive especially when doing HIIT once a week.

Any ideas or discussion is appreciated.
Heavier climbers got any tips? As the title says im a heavier climber 260 (little heavier these past few years)but about 6 foot with a +4 reach. Work out a lot and am fairly strong. Stuck at v5-v6 for a bit now.


Edit: Should note that I've had a few knee surgeries and now have a cadaver lateral meniscus. Aka, flexibility and strength on that particular leg are not great. Working with a PT on it.
When to end a training session? Hello, newish climber here(1.5 years, ~V4/6c outside).
I used to do gymnastics 2-3x per week and for us it was normal to have sore muscles after training which was a good indicator of whether a training was physically useful. I have a feeling that I am physically capable of bouldering harder, only my technique and finger strength are lacking.
Depending on weekend activities, I train 2-3 times in a bouldering gym or on local boulders, sometimes I do not have climbing opportunities for a week. My additional training consists mainly of flexibility and the odd pull ups.

My question is: what are good indicators when to stop a session in my position? 
When is the ideal time to end training?


My main indicator right now is when I no longer am fitt enough to meaningfully project hard indoor boulders or am no longer able to flash medium problems. My problem with that is that I do not feel much musclesoreness in my forearms that often anymore.
A secondary indicator is forearm soreness orI finger itches/pain which I seldom reach.


Should I increase my training time to longer than 2 hrs to get more mileage on easier/medium problems? My thinking is that this may help my technique as well as my finger strength.
Realistic yearly goals? With the new year coming in I'm interested in what goals you might have previously set and (hopefully) achieved. I'm currently climbing V3/4 [indoors] based on ~ 4 months of consistent climbing up to now and a good amount pre-covid. This year I'll be able to climb 2/3 times a week throughout the year and am working from a low strength baseline (very skinny). V5 seems an obvious target, is two grades feasible? I'm curious what improvements any of you might have seen over the course of a year, and what psychical and technical levels you started and ended at.
How to tell the difference between failing due to bad technique vs lack of strength vs bad beta? I'm fairly new to climbing (started around the end of 2019, stopped for the whole of two years, and now I'm on indoor bouldering session #5)

I mostly float around trying to piece together moves on stuff anywhere up to V6 just to see what moves I can and can't do.

I have no expectations of being able to send or not send anything; I'm just trying to enjoy and learn ways to move around. However, I often have no idea if

* I'm approaching a problem wrong, or
* I'm just not engaging properly/not using my body correctly, or
* I'm doing everything mostly right but I'm just too weak to implement what I'm trying to do

and I can't tell the difference. When I fall off, it's almost alway "my hand is involuntarily opening up" and no amount of playing with my footwork or body position (with my limited knowledge) helps.

Watching people helps but it's hard to tell what they're actively engaging and at what times, or if they even actually have good technique that would work for me.

Is there anything I can practice to figure this out? It's very odd watching people float up stuff and having no idea how they're doing it because even copying their moves feels strenuous/I can't hold on.  


EDIT: if it's useful, my background is in strength sports (powerlifting, olympic lifting) but thanks to COVID I didn't get to really train those for a year and so I'm trying to pivot to climbing as I rebuild strength.

A lifter who wants to climb How do I combine my lifting with climbing? As the title says, I've been a lifter for several years and I enjoy doing it to look good and make gains. 

But I recently took a climbing class and enjoyed it. I just want to climb like once a week for fun and to slowly get better. boulder, maybe do a trip someday to climb outside? Even though just once a week, I'd still like it go be a session I can go at it pretty hard? 

I can't figure out how I would add this. I generally add only light or less physical stuff to my schedule outside the gym. Should climbing be on a rest day? Or maybe as long as it's not right after a pull day and a pull day doesn't follow? I train my muscle groups 2 times a week, maybe it would be fine to train pulls 2+ 1 climb day
Toe Hooking as a Taller Climber I'm looking for some advice on getting better at toe hooking in body positions where it's difficult to straighten your leg and lean against a toe hook. I'm not incredibly tall at 5'11", but many problems at my gym are set at a distance that feels too close to use properly. I see shorter climbers look very natural while I'm struggling.

In general I would say I'm decent at the technique for the grade I climb (V5/6), it's just these types of toe hooks I struggle with. I play around with the body position as much as I can, but at a certain point my upper body strength seems to limit how far I can lean out of position to straighten my leg. An area I can certainly improve is my hip mobility and I've been doing more stretching to improve there. Frog pose has been a big help.

Has anyone felt a similar way and found solutions that work for them? I hate blaming my inability to send a problem on my body type.
Dave Macleod - Training session Dave Macleod has released a second video focusing on a single training session with him.

[Fast recovery from my elbow injury - hard boulder time!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQV7LfORQwI)

I find them the best example of the thoughts of a great climber in how they approach a session day to day. He has just come back from injury and is slowly ramping up his training. 

His is very vocal and describes the reasons behind what things he spends his time on, as well as how he adapts on the go depending on how he feel each session. 

I think it is an amazing example of how you can have a climbing focused training session, rather than a gym focused one. He spends a lot of his time studying nutrition so its interesting seeing the experience of someone that integrates their diet into training more than most.

Worth having a watch and see what you think.

Long term goal Hello everyone,

I have been bouldering maybe 20-30 times over the past 6 months but have found it is impossible to sustain while also being a collegiate athlete (swimming). I enjoy climbing a lot and look forward to taking it more seriously after I graduate and am looking for some advice. 

Would it be advisable to train hang board to build up finger strength in the meantime? I have about 1 more year of swimming left, and think building up finger strength now would allow me to climb more often/better once I graduate.

If so any advice about where to get started?

For reference:
- I climb v3-v4 depending on the gym
- The reason I say it’s unsustainable is that climbing tires out the same muscles as swimming, and we already have 20 mandatory hours of swim/lifting workouts per week
- My assumption is hangboard would increase finger tendon strength without fatiguing the rest of the body but could be wrong.

Thank you!
Tangentially related subject: How do I stop comparing myself to my friend who is of a similar skill level but much taller than me? I've been climbing for about 3.5 years now, my friend is the same. I've trained my fair amount, especially within the past 1.5 years, doing lots of core, hangboarding, and supplementary fitness exercises, as well as climbing on average a couple times a week. My friend does not really do any of these things other than climbing. He also happens to be 6'5 with a +3 ape index, while I'm 5'9 with a -1 ape index. Because of this he gets problems much faster and easier than me which is very frustrating when I climb with him, to the point of ruining some of my sessions. I really like my friend and know that he is also a good climber in his own right, but it is hard to deal with sometimes when I am trying a boulder that is very difficult for me and he reaches through the crux or finds an easier method because of his height, much quicker than I can.

While none of this should really matter that much, it is impacting my happiness while climbing sometimes. I know this is a "me" problem and is in no way his fault, I'm simply wondering if anyone else has had this issue or has had experience dealing with this kind of comparison in the past, or has any potential solutions? Thanks!
Best way to stay in climbing shape (even better improve) on limited free time? I'm a fairly intermediate climber breaking into the lower 5.11's and V4/v5 range after climbing for about 1.5 years fairly often. 

I'm going to be moving into a phase of my life where I'm going to be working 50+ hours per week plus doing grad school part time. So I'll be dropping my climbing sessions from 3-4x per week to 2-3x if I'm lucky and may have to skip some weeks altogether. 

What are some good ways I can keep in good climbing shape, or even better improve, when I have limited free time and might not make it to the gym or the crag? 

My thoughts are to do general calisthenics and use my rock rings for hangboarding but just curious if there is anything else I should think of.
How I dealt with fear of falling This seems to be a pretty big topic, so I thought I would write my own experience here. [I also made a video about the exercises that worked for me.](https://youtu.be/h-WfKjbY75M)

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;** I dealt with my fear of falling by taking falls, and dealt with my fear of losing control by focussing on my breathing (using my belt as a cue/reminder).

&amp;#x200B;

I started climbing a year after I started bouldering. I would rarely get scared when bouldering, because I had 10 years of martial arts experience and I knew how to fall. However things were different when climbing: I got scared even when top roping. The general advice seems to be 'just take more falls', which I did! In fact, I'm a cognitive psychologist so I did several structured falling sessions and those seemed to help.

Then I started lead climbing. And once again, the advice seemed to be 'just take more falls'. So once again I started with some sessions structured around falling. This definitely helped, but I would still get scared when above the bolt. The more scared I was, the more difficult it was to move, which means I stayed in an insecure position and got more pumped so also more scared.

&amp;#x200B;

I met someone during a climbing trip (aptly named Neo) who gave me the best advice I've ever heard on this topic: get comfortable being insecure. Don't spend time trying to get secure, instead get into the flow and keep going up. Eventually, you'll get upwards momentum.

This advice totally resonated with me. I understood this was exactly my issue. I should stop trying to be in 100% control of every move. However, it was quite difficult to change as my body had learned to just squeeze harder every time I felt insecure.

&amp;#x200B;

So I tried the 2 exercises from the video: singing (to override my mind and get into the flow) and a belt trick (to focus on breathing). The belt trick is something I learned from martial arts and it was crazy how effective it was! I simply put the strap of my chalk bag below my belly button and pulled really tight. As a result, I had a constant cue/reminder to keep breathing with my belly. Every time I felt insecure, I would take a deep breath and the pump/fear would disappear.

I think this trick allows me to have some control (or rather it makes me feel like I'm in control) without distracting me or cause any other negative effect (for instance squeezing harder also gave me the sense of control, but also caused me to pump out at the second bolt :p). Anyway, give it a go if you're struggling with fear of falling when lead climbing!
As a former cyclist with big muscly legs, how do I get skinny legs? I run a mile or two (sometimes more) a couple days a week as part of my warmup for climbing or strength training. I also occasionally bike or ski tour [deleted]
Benching doesnt cause internal rotation! There have been multiple posts on this sub during the past few years claiming that benching causes internal rotation and is not healthy for your shoulders. This is in fact false. The opposite is true.

If you are benching with inproper form, benching can exacerbate internal rotation. This happens if you do not properly retract and depress the scapulea, and do not slightly externally rotate the scapulae by bending and pulling the bar apart (typical cue for powerlifting)

Here is a picture of the scapula and its directions of movement ([https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOORTHJ-10-80/FIGURE/F1b/](https://benthamopen.com/FULLTEXT/TOORTHJ-10-80/FIGURE/F1b/)). Basically everything you are doing is opposite of what the typical climbers posture is. By learning good benching technique, you learn to adapt a posture that fixes internally rotation and shoulder protraction (by doing the opposite of that).

The same technique applies to all pressing movements. Except in vertical pressing (shoulder press, OHP) you shoulder will internally rotate at the top of the movement to lock the elbows and In the beginning you are more focused on depression, not so much on retraction, since this is almost impossible in that position. This is not a faulty movement pattern, but the natural movement of your scapula. This is what weighlifters do when jerking huge weights on top of your head or snatching.

Claiming that benching or pressing movements cause internal rotation is also weird, since climbers who do mainly pulling suffer the most from internal rotation, while weighlifters and powerlifters who do mostly pushing with their upperbody do not have problems with internal rotation. You will rarely see a weighlifter that walks with constant shoulder internal rotation, since this would significantly inhibit his ability to press. Also, significant internal rotation would make benching very hard for powerlifters, since you are unable to set the scapulea properly.

Examples:

You can clearly see how Kirill Sarychev (arguably the second best raw bencher in the world) sets his upperback, and his shoulders do not internally rotate at any point ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOeRI6MDyns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOeRI6MDyns)). He keeps constant tension and back position during the whole movement. You can also look at his posture when not benching and he has very good shoulder position, not at all protracted or internally rotated although he is heavily focused on benching and pressing.

Here is another video of the world third best raw bencher, Spoto. He maintains constant shoulder depression and retraction ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RA0ZIngXew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RA0ZIngXew)).

Ironically, the worlds best bencher loses the proper tightness in the upperback and slightly enters into internal rotation when the bar touches the chest, since he is sinking the bar. I would not recommend doing this. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDIJAVxzsFc&amp;t=14s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDIJAVxzsFc&amp;t=14s)). The guy is just a freak and makes this work for him. Dan Green, although one of the greatest lifters of all time, also uses this not so effective technique ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDoDJ4qqfUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDoDJ4qqfUs)). So don’t do this.

Jeff Nippard has a good video about benching technique, so maybe watch this ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcBig73ojpE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcBig73ojpE)).

The same basic rules apply to the overhead press. Here is a good video on this also by Jeff ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_RlRDWO2jfg&amp;t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RlRDWO2jfg&amp;t=4s)). Pay attention to the position of his shoulders and upperback.
How often do you take rest while training? I'm curious how people structure their training plans? I've read that you will feel weaker during the training period but make noticeable gains during rest period. So what are people's training schedule look like? a month on with a week rest inbetween? training all year around?
What are some ways to work on technique? First off, let's clarify something. I know that a bunch of replies will tell me to "just climb more" and that is just what I will do. But the purpose of this post is to find out about specific ways, drills or approaches to climbing that might help with developing a technique. 

After running a few tests, my coach has told me that I have the strength of an 8a climber. But I climb 7a. Which I find embarrassing. I can do one arm pull-ups, lock-offs, pull-ups with 50kg etc. So I thought hey, we've had enough strength training by now, let's work on technique! But as usual, I figured out I have no plan on how to do that. 

I already know a couple of drills like climbing as silently as possible, no readjusting and climbing without any momentum, but I don't know how well are they going to translate into my overall technique. 

Secondly, something that has been bothering me for a while is heel hooking. I am absolute dog shit at heel hooking. Unless the hold is the size of a closed fist, my heel and entire foot just slip off. So my question here is, how do I practice heel hooking if I can't heel hook anything? Could my shoes be a problem? I am still using the beginner clunky shoes as I thought the better ones are too expensive, but now I am willing to make the investment if it's gonna help me perform better. I really want to be able to heel hook much smaller holds, but I am completely, utterly lost.

The final thing worth mentioning, or asking, is why do my feet always come off the wall on semi big overhang moves? It's a thing that really annoys me and I don't know how to work on it. Is it a weak core? It happens to me only in the 45° overhang (+45° too but I rarely climb on anything above 45°), does it mean I should spend more time climbing in the 45° overhang? 

Any help is appreciated, whether you're an expert or intermediate like me. Thanks in advance.
Deep Lock-offs Deep lock-offs have been a weakness of mine for years. A few goal projects require some strength here but it’s a quality I would like to improve over the coming year. Here is what I’ve tried so far and some general notes:

* Good overall shoulder and scapular mobility on all diagnostic tests I can find.
* Good lock off strength at 120 and 90 degree angles. There’s no strength standards for this, but I can generally do 1 arm locks with 15-20lbs for 7s. My hardest sends are on granite crimps with balance-y lock-offs at around these angles.
* Good mobility in the actual position.
* I’ve tried various on wall drills at every angle and don’t find them super useful. My board is 50 degrees but even at 40 it feels more like a row and as a climber it is the opposite of the coordination patterns I use otherwise.
* I tried deep 1 arm lock-offs but it may or may not have caused golfer’s elbow due to compression of the bicep tendon.
* I have read Eva Lopez’s article on lock-off strength, which posits that locks are only 1-2s long and that you should basically train dynamically and pause at the peak contraction. Not super useful.
* I did try uneven grip pull-ups for a while and might have had the grip set a bit wrong, but I found it hard to not subconsciously pull with the upper hand at peak contraction.
* I am 6 foot 3 with a +1.5 ape index. You’d think “oh you can just reach through” and sometimes I definitely can, however, I think with strength in this end range I would be much more stable and controlled as well as not have to tap into so much strength. I have a long torso and short legs for my height and generally can’t use super tall guy beta. FML
* I generally am not strong in the end range of the pull-up. I can do about 5 standard grip pull-ups to my chest and I generally have to use no kipping velocity to do so.

Anything else I have not tried or that anyone can think of? Tricep strength? Deep pull-ups? Blood sacrifices during a full moon?
I cannot, for the life of me, figure out aerobic capacity training with home walls Like the title says. I historically am not good at endurance climbing. You know the kind where you have to do like 20-30 sub-maximal moves in a row and get pumped out of your mind?

My hardest sends have all been something like one hard boulder with easier climbing after (so like v5-6 to 5.11+ climbing after for a 5.12+ or 13-). Or like hard problem, incredible rest, hard problem, huge rest again, etc.

Also, the routes I've been able to do that have  a lot of moves I've climbed like Ondra fast. Like bat out of hell fast. And just barely manage to get the send. After that send, I'm pretty much wasted for the day and maybe the next day too. Heaven help me if there is a grade well below my max  but it has a lot of moves and, by the nature of the moves I have to climb slow.

I've got a goal to do a big trad route this year with lots of pitches that have sub-maximal climbing, but hard enough that my endurance, specifically my long-duration endurance, aerobic capacity if you will, will need to be really good. Problem is, I just cannot figure out a good way to train it without roped climbing (I only train on woodies at home, 20\* and 45\* overhung) and roped climb outside. I swear there must be a way but most things I've tried haven't seemed to help. 

Here are the two things I **know** have worked in the past:

* Two times a week sport or trad climbing sessions. Just doing a bunch of pitches (10+ pitches)in a couple hours at an intensity that is just below max onsight. So still somewhat tough but not really in danger of falling. Not really doable with my training situation and life schedule right now.
* When I was in grad school, I did 20' aerobic capacity sessions every day. I would alternate between 20' ARC one day and 1' over threshold x 1' under threshold x 10 the other day. These sessions were just on my hangboard with feet on the ground. Extremely boring but seemed effective. I'll be going back to this if I can't figure out something less boring or more effective.

Here are some things I've tried that don't really seem to move the needle much:

* Dedicated ARCing sessions. I get tired by the end yes, but short of just doing a whole ARC cycle like the RPTM advocates, I don't seem to get anything from it. Maybe if it's that important I should try a cycle of just ARC?
* Steve Betchel's "Extensive Endurance" sessions, not because I don't think he's right, but because I struggle to get the intensity correct on my home walls. Even 20\* overhanging is too hard for me to simulate a pitch of climbing on and just do laps on a circuit/pitch. I don't know. Maybe I could get it to work with easier holds? Feet on the ground just ends up being too easy and then I lack the skill development component as well.
* General aerobic conditioning. It's nice to have good aerobic conditioning, but doesn't seem to help with forearm endurance. It mostly helps with just not getting out of breath and overly tired generally while climbing, which is nice, but not really what I'm shooting for here.
* Power Endurance training doesn't seem to move the aerobic capacity needle much. I can eventually do more moves in a row, but I never seem to be able to get above a certain point even when I do a long cycle of focusing on it. Feels like there is a ceiling that is dictated by my capacity.

For reference, I used to do lattice assessments and I built my own little endurance circuit on my 20\* board that I do self-assessments on once a month to check progress with endurance (I also assess strength components as well, but I feel pretty good about my ability to train those). So I get a pretty good feel of where I am consistently and I try to experiment with different approaches and see what helps and what doesn't.

Writing this post has given me some ideas already. But I would really enjoy hearing from others what experience they've had and if anyone has thoughts on how to do this without consistent roped climbing. I will be doing more roped climbing when it warms up outdoors again, but for now I can't really count on it. Cheers!
Projects in the gym Say there is a problem at the gym which you are pysched on. It is right at your limit, if not slightly beyond.

How much time per week, or per training session, would you dedicate to trying the moves, or trying to link sequences on this really hard problem?

To me it's not clear if it's worth camping on this problem every time you visit vs sacking it entirely to do more routine training. When is the point of diminishing returns in trying something that you might not ever send, as it will be taken down on resetting?

What is your opinion?
Managing risk and fear outdoor bouldering Recently I've been going outdoor for bouldering a lot more, and I've been getting a lot better at the outdoor specific skills (footwork, irregular holds, etc.)

One of the big things I adapted to was the greater degree of risk outdoors (bad landing, less padding, trusting spotter), and as I've been climbing more my fear response has gotten muted. I've noticed I've gotten better at not panicking and thinking clearly when topping out a risky, sketchy highball routes.

I've always thought this was a good change, but today when trying a route with 1 pad, I was so focused on the climb I decided to make a move to slap to a right-side hold and ended up completely missing the pad when I fell off.

Strangely, I didn't experience any fear when falling (no adrenaline rush, shakes), I simply slipped off, and instinctively looked down and found myself on the ground after landing on my feet. Thankfully I landed well and didn't get hurt, but thinking about it rationally, it was pretty dumb and it's definitely not a stunt I want to repeat in the future. 

Was wondering what the subs thoughts are towards fear management and climbing, and what sort of drills/practices they use to ensure they strike the balance with risk, consequence, fear and goals.
Working on an app. What kind of visualizations would you want to see if you had the date+grade+type of every climb you did? Here is an example from my session tonight
Can anyone explain these gains in finger strength from simple kung fu finger exercises? I've been climbing (mostly bouldering) for about 5 years but I'm new to training for climbing. Because of a lockdown I just tried 4 weeks of kung fu training for my fingers. The improvements have been massive! Can anyone explain?

So for about a year now, I've been hangboarding as part of my warmup. This has been great, but hasn't led to any improvement in finger strength. Somewhere around October I did 4 weeks of training (I copied Magnus Midtbø's training routine, which was a terrible idea and almost got me injured) and my finger strength improved from +19kg to +20kg on a 20mm edge. With this kung fu training I improved my finger strength from +20kg to +26kg. Which blows my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

The exercises were very simple, 3 times a week:

* Throw and grab a bag of rice of about 1.5kg in various ways (about 60x in total)
* Pushups (with most weight on the knees): 5x on fingers, 5x on finger knuckles, 5x on wrists, 5x on finger pads and 5x with fingers clustered together.

I made a video to explain: [https://youtu.be/Dx9jqqHnvSk](https://youtu.be/Dx9jqqHnvSk)

&amp;#x200B;

My own theory is that these improvements are basically newbie gains, and any type of training would've worked. But maybe there's something to be said for this type of training? After all, Olavo (the guy who taught me these exercises) had fingers of steel from 13 years of kung fu which allowed him to boulder 7A/V6 on his first day of climbing.

Or maybe going from +20kg to +26kg isn't that much? I have no idea, so any insights will be greatly appreciated!!
Friend who’s new to climbing can hang Beastmaker 45° slopers easily Video of him doing a pull-up on the 45° slopers. [[Link].](https://imgur.com/a/A7xso4H) It may look like he’s using the inside of his pointer fingers to press against the vertical edge but he definitely is not. I was obviously baffled by this feat and investigated the legitimacy of his hang quite closely, he is holding it totally legitimately. He was able to deadhang for about 15 seconds.

My friend has climbed a couple of times in the past. He’s naturally quite strong but not super-human strong or anything. Anyway, he can hang the beastmaker 45° slopers basically no problem, whereas on the same hangboard I cannot hold them for my life. I’ve been climbing for about 5-6 years. I am definitely “stronger” for my bodyweight at holding various hold-types, including slopers.

We learned that taking off all chalk and having a bit of moisture/sweat gives a bit better friction. But even if I try everything he tries, I can’t hang them. I’m led to believe it make be because of skin texture &amp; pliability, or hand morphology, or both. I’m not sure though.

Thoughts?
ARCing is detrimental for your strength goals and bouldering performance Many climbing coaches like to promote ARCing for boulderers and to enhance recovery. Some even say it promotes recovery from climbing. In ARCing you do 20 to 45 minute continuous climbing with very little or no pump. The idea is to not surpass anaerobic threshold to promote the aerobic metabolic pathways, which many argue to enhances recovery between sets, enhances endurance while bouldering and in general is just a great thing to do for almost everyone.

I could not disagree more.

First of all, there is this thing called ***the interference effect***. This means that when training endurance there is interference effect that is detrimental to your strength gains. There is just so much evidence for this concept.

You will start converting fast twitch fibers to slow twitch. You muscle fiber metabolism starts to switch to favour fat based metabolism instead of carbohydrate based glycolysis for fast energy release. Strength also requires a lot of hypertrophy and neuromuscular adaptations. Endurance training doesn’t elicit significant hypertrophy and doesn’t elicit neuromuscular adaptations for maximal strength output.

There is also evidence that endurance and strength training stimulate biochemical pathways in the muscle cell that counteract each other. Stimulating the other thus directly inhibits changes to favour glycolytic metabolism and hypertrophy. In cell and animal studies, the AMPK signalling cascade has been found to inhibit mTOR pathway, so we actually have a biochemical reason to believe that there is a significant interference effect. There is also evidence that endurance training supresses satellite cell density, which is also directly detrimental.

You can read on the interference effect from this review for example ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5407958/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5407958/)).

Then there is ***the rule of specificity***. If you want to improve in maximal exercise that lasts from 30 seconds to 3 minutes, which is like 98% of bouldering, you should do training that is close to this length and intensity. ARCing directly violates this principle. If you want to improve endurance for bouldering, you should be training your lactate threshold by getting crazy pumped in few minutes! You should not train your aerobic capacity by not getting pumped in 30 minutes! This has no benefit and is detrimental for your strength and lactate threshold training that is max few minutes in duration. In Lead climbing that is (~~is mostly~~ (okay not mostly, I wrote this poorly)) few minutes in length you are way over your lactate threshold, so I do not really think ARCing is that beneficial for even that. You would rather just take a rest day or increase your actual lead climbing volume, rather than do unspecific training for no reason.

Leits use squatting as an example, since it makes this point pretty obvious. If you want to get strong in doing 10 repetion squat (like 10 move boulder), consider doing a lot of training that is very hard at 5 to 15 repetition (or climbing move) range. You don’t get a strong 10 rep squat by doing 45 minutes of continuous squatting without a pump. You can do that all you want, but all it does is fatigue your quads and make your strength gains worse. It doesnt enhance intra set recovery or make you do more reps with heavy weights.

Also, every exercise has a recovery demand. Since you are activating metabolic pathways and depleting resources in your muscles by doing ARCing, you need to recover from that. Some people claim that ARCing doesn’t have a recovery demand and I do not even know how to justify this claim, since it obviously does. This means that by doing more ARCing you can do less other training that is specific to your goal, which in itself is detrimental. So not only do you directly inhibit your gains, you can also do less specific training that would actually make you good.

Some also say that they get less muscle soreness after ARCing and this is a sign of better recovery. It isnt. DOMS are caused by inflammatory cascade and metabolic pathways that hard training elicits. By removing doms with light exercise, you are inhibiting the inflammatory cascade that is part of the hypertrophy and strength signaling that happens in your cell. It is not a good effect, but a detrimental one.

The best way to recover from exercise is to be in a deep sleep with an intravenous glucose and amino acid drip, not doing ARCing or other exercise that fatigues the muscles you want to recover.

So go do heavy strength training, eat a pizza, go to sleep and take a rest day. Dont do ARCing.

Roast me in the comments please. I bet someone comes up with a reason to do very unspecific training rather than specific.

ARCing is like a virus in the climbing/bouldering community that spreads, but has no relation to sport science.

EDIT: I am not claiming that general aerobic training is that bad. ARCing is not a good way to do general aerobic training. The point of ARCing is to increase forearm specific aerobic endurance, not systemic aerobic endurane that you need in some amount. Rather do running or cycling for that and keep your forearms fresh. You need some amount of aerobic fitness for all sports, but for strength sports the requirement is quite low. Also, close to failure training already causes tissue specific aerobic adaptations, just not systemic.

EDIT2: There are many good comments, I got some reading to do now to learn new stuff about aerobic training and come up with a post that better covers this issue.
How can I tell how much crimping I can do? I recently had a small pulley injury due to getting overly excited and crimping for a long time trying out all the new routes, but I didn't feel I was pulling to hard. Today I was doing a route which required you to pull hard on a bad crimp and I could feel a lot of pressure/tension in my fingers. I tried the move but I didn't commit as it felt scary for my finger health. 

The question is how can I judge if I am ready to crimp hard? Is it normal to feel that kind of pressure even if my body can safely do it?
Climbing as a teenager This post is a question surrounding habits I should try to build up moving forward as a boulderer.

*throwaway account

So I’m (just) 14 years old, and although I’ve been climbing for all of my life as a result of my dad’s dabbling in his youth, I never really got into climbing proper until about a year and a half ago. Since then, I’ve been consistently going to a local bouldering gym about 4 times a week, with a 4-month gap in that time frame due to COVID restrictions. I’ve gone from around v2-3 on the rare occasion I went to a dedicated venue, to the occasional v7/8 and consistent v6. 

During my sessions, I tend to spend 1.5-2.5 hours working projects, or trying newly set routes - as I climb at only one gym, I’m at the point where I’ve tried all of the problems, and generally know where I stand on each - but about 10-12 routes are reset every week. I rarely hang board, though my dad does have one set up at home and if I’m passing under the doorframe it’s bolted to I’ll grab the 10mm edges for a few seconds. I’ve tried campusing, but I can only get about 1-4-7 on big edges. While training, I tend to take long breaks between routes, and have poor stamina while on the wall.

Usually I climb along, with casual interaction with other regulars and staff, though recently I’ve been bringing along a school friend who’s totally new to climbing. 

I’m quite terrible at dynos, my movement efficiency is pretty appalling, and my stamina sucks. Not to mention, my warm up is essentially just “do a v0” then get on the harder stuff.

My question is, what should I try to focus on (external exercises, warm ups/stretches, etc) if I mean to improve in coming years?
High gaston move- I’m trying “the Shield” and was wondering was the best way to train for high gastons would be (besides just trying different high gastons) maybe specially board climbs with similar moves or certain shoulder exercises?
It took me a pandemic to realize I should exclusively lead climb in the gym if I want to be a better lead climber outdoors. Sounds dumb and obvious, but this realization totally changed my climbing and if you're a TR warrior with outdoor goals, it could change yours. Before the pandemic, I would see strong climbers in my gym who only ever lead climbed. They would be leading hard routes and I would think "I need to get stronger so that I'll feel confident enough to lead routes like that." Then I'd go back to projecting routes on top rope and only very rarely leading an easy route or two. Whenever I took a trip to climb outside, I'd find that I was only comfortable leading very easy routes outdoors. Duh.

Then Covid happened. Like a lot of people, I stopped going to my climbing gym during the start of the pandemic and I lost a lot of strength. I also had a lot of time to think. I realized that I was practicing a skill in the gym that didn't align with my goals. I wanted to climb hard sport routes outside but I was never going to do that if I never practiced lead climbing hard routes inside. So decided I would stop top roping entirely. 

When I came back to the gym, I found a climbing partner who had the same goals as me and wanted to only lead climb. One excuse I'd made in the past was that my partner didn't want to lead, didn't know how to lead belay, or couldn't be trusted to do a good job lead belaying. After making this switch, I've found that none of those were true and they were all in my head. 

Another thing that used to hold me back from leading was my own ego. I wanted to climb the highest grade I could and I knew I wouldn't be able to do that on lead. But now, the break from climbing had made me weak and humble. I couldn't TR hard routes even if I wanted to, and I knew it wouldn't help me reach my goals. 

So I picked a climbing grade that felt easy to me and decided to lead every route of that grade in the gym. For me that was 5.10s. If that sounds like a brag, remember that all gym grades are made up and my gym is probably softer than yours. On the other hand, if it sounds way too easy, then that's perfect. My gym sets new routes every week or two, so as I worked on climbing all the 10s from oldest to newest, they would set new ones. Climbing twice a week, it took me a month to catch up with the setters. Doing this gave me a TON of practice clipping draws, hanging from one hand, being above my last point of protection, and taking the occasional fall. You know... all the stuff that you don't practice when you're top roping but that you absolutely need to be comfortable with to be a good lead climber. After that month, I felt so much more confident leading than I ever had when I was "stronger". The fear that normally came with lead climbing was gone.

Then I just moved my goal up a grade so that I was trying every 11- in the gym. I would fall slightly more often but all those falls turned out to be fine. That only made me feel more confident. Each time I finished all the climbs of one grade, I bumped up a grade until I was climbing things that I KNEW I wouldn't be able to flash. That's something I never would have done when I was just top roping. When I rarely led any routes, my perception of safety was very connected with having a rope above me. Now that all I do is lead, my brain has adjusted what feels unsafe and I can think clearly, don't over-grip holds, don't panic if I'm not sure I'll be able to make the next move. It took me going through this to realize that those climbers I used to see leading hard routes didn't get to that point by TRing even harder routes; they got there by always lead climbing.

Now when I talk to folks at the gym about new, difficult routes, they say "yeah, I'll probably practice it on top rope for a while before I lead it." When I say that I'm just going to project it on lead, I'm sure they assume I think I'm "too cool" for TR. Really if folks want to TR in the gym because it's fun and it matches their goals then I say go for it. But if you're like me and you goal is to lead hard routes outdoors, you should start practicing by leading routes indoors that you're not sure you'll be able to climb. It's like every post where people ask "what workouts should I do to be a better climber?" and the answer is "climb more". To be a better lead climber, I had to lead climb more. 

**TLDR:** I used the shutdown from the pandemic to realize I should stop top roping in the gym and now I only lead climb. I'm dumb so it took me forever to realize this is what I needed to do to become a better and more confident lead climber.
Training for national level I have a few national comps coming up that I really want to podium in. But honestly I have been lucky. I have really good finger strength and am great at slab and sketchy climbs as I can pretty much stand on anything. In my previous higher level most of the qualifiers and semis have had hard slabs that I can breze through but as soon as finals comes it's all burly climbs with huge dynos and coordination moves and I never top them.

Does anyone have any sesion plans that can help me improve explosive power and staminer or anything else that can help me with these. I have read a few books but it never really makes much sense. 
 
Thanks
Dumbass Challenge Writeup [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/rds40o/train_like_a_dumbass_january_challenge/) is the original post.  TLDR, 10,000 kettlebell swings, mostly 40kg bell, some 36kg, some 44kg.  10,000 seconds time under tension for deadhangs on a 20mm edge.  Everything done as 25 sets of 20 reps or 20 seconds.  I intended to ARC Mt Everest, 29000 ft, as well, but Omicron.  


Results.  Completed in 20 workouts, 24 calendar days.  Gained weight (2-5lbs), lost fat.  I did not do any kind of body comp measurements, but I'm visually leaner, maybe 2-3% BF dropped.  Which makes sense, swings are exhausting.    My lower back is noticeably thicker, forearms are more vascular.  Feel super fit, cardio wise.  My swing movement feels super crisp (duh) and my strict half crimp grip feels really locked in.  Fingers feel healthier than when I started. Some of the workouts were really mentally exhausting.  I was tallying reps on a whiteboard because you forget what year it is halfway through some of those workouts.     


For numbers, I didn't pre-test, and I don't really believe in maxing out at all, so this is kind of bullshit.  But I deadlifted 2x bodyweight for a easy, easy triple, and I don't think I've ever moved anywhere near that much weight, that quickly.  Definitely felt like I could have pulled 405 for 3, and 455ish for 1.  Maybe I should have pushed for a 475 single, because that would be a bit more than 3x bodyweight.    


For deadhangs, I did some easy (RPE &lt; 8) 10s hangs up to BW+70% on a 20mm edge, and did consecutive 1-arm pullups on the BM2k center edge, which is something I've never done before.  For both sets, the half crimp grip felt stricter than usual for a heavy test.  I'm positive I could have added more weight for the 2 arm hang, and could have 1armed +10ish lbs.    


Conclusion:  The deadhang program is cool.  Might repeat it in August, maybe on 15mm?  Honestly, I think that a high volume, moderate intensity deadhang approach has more value than we realize, especially for off-season training. 

The swings are good, but I don't think it's super applicable to climbing.  The combined swings and hangs really blast your grip, especially with the heavy kettlebell.  I'll be interested to see what that will mean in terms of climbing fitness.
85% of climbers don't do this one simple trick to climb harder! (Not clickbait) BRUSH THE HOLDS

That's right if you brush the holds before you climb you will be able to climb harder. Straight up makes the holds stickier. 

Also, you wont get that guy giving you stank eye when you rub your greasy mitts all over his proj after he brushed it.  

It's just a good thing to do. You keep the holds better for longer and it's also good for the rock if you use the right brush(plastic can be bad). Everytime I brush the holds I feel like I'm doing a small community service.

"But wait Nick!" you say "I already brush the holds on the moonboard."

Guess what! You can brush boulder problems or even *GASP* sport climbs!  

And no one will judge you. All the strong climbers will even give you a subtle nod of appreciation.

So start brushing holds more and spread the good word!  Then we can all climb harder on sticky holds and feet.

2 months to prep for a weeklong Sport Climbing Trip I'm headed on a climbing vacation at the beginning of April and want to be in the best shape I can for it. I'm coming off an unrelated injury that has stopped me from climbing since last summer. At my peak fitness, I've been leading mid-10s outside, but I'm afraid I'm pretty far off that today, having been out of the game for a half year or more.

My injury is better now, so I can get back to it at a locl climbing gym with bouldering, toprope, lead, hangboards, traditional fitness equipment, it's pretty well featured.

Any recommendations on how to best prep for getting back in shape in \~2 months?
A letter to those who are self-diagnosing injuries I've spent 9+ weeks self-rehabbing a shoulder injury, refusing to head to a specialist because I thought I had it under control. I can still climb, I am doing at-home PT with slight improvements over the past few months, etc. Since the day of the injury I jumped through mental hoops to avoid seeing a Dr., telling myself that "it's not that bad" or "I can still climb, it's probably just a small tweak". 9 weeks later, I am still having symptoms and found myself making more excuses to not see a doctor. I finally caved and saw a specialist the other day just for him to do a few tests, order an MRI, and inform me that I will likely need to undergo a surgery to repair a torn labrum. This could have been diagnosed and the rehab could have began months ago had I not been stubborn and thought I could self-diagnose a complicated body part. A lot of time and a lot of mental energy went into convincing myself that I had it under control, and luckily I didn't keep pushing it further. But now I am now mentally beating myself up for wasting 9 weeks that could have been spent rehabbing from a likely inevitable surgery.

Now, I realize that not everyone can afford seeing doctors for every minor injury, and certainly for some injuries self-diagnosis is sufficient (fingers, tendonitis, etc.). But for major/complicated injuries; shoulders, back, hips, legs., please don't fall into the trap of self-diagnosis. If you find yourself wanting to see a doctor but continually telling yourself that "its OK".. please do yourself a favor and schedule an appointment with a specialist. At the least, you will get mental relief when the doctor tells you that your diagnosis was correct and your plan of attack is good. No more thinking the worst, you now have confirmation from a professional that you will be OK. On the other hand, if you have a serious injury, the doctor will be able to properly diagnose it and get you on track early in your rehab process. Don't be like me and waste 9 weeks thinking you had it under control. Please see a doctor.
Do people actually use the figure four? https://www.instagram.com/reel/CZcp2ATB3dX/

I came across this video on Instagram, teaching you “how to master the figure four.” The caption explains that it’s mostly used on steep walls, where there are no footholds to push off of. I can see how it would be useful in that situation, but I’ve never seen anyone doing this IRL. Is the figure four a common technique that people just don’t do in my home gym, or is there a better option in situations like the one seen here? And if this is a technique worth working on, are there other situations where it would be equally useful?
People who actually got injured from overtraining Hello,

I recently saw a video from David Goggins where he repeats that there is no point in resting and you should try hard all day, every day. He was not talking about climbing, but this got me thinking. I know people who climb/train all day and swear that this is the way and people who think that resting is as important as training.   


I also remember someone mentioning that people that started doing Alex Puccio's training plan, which was very intense, ended up injuring themselves. I also know that Lattice recommends resting and emphasize its importance.  


In the end I wanted to know what is your personal experience. For how long have you been climbing, how much are you climbing/training and did you actually get injured from overtraining?  


PS: I am not trying to make this a discussion about which is the best or correct way, I am just curious about each ones way of approaching the training for climbing. Stay safe everyone.
Climbing goals for 2022, need input on my plan to reach them My main goal is to climb an 8A boulder before 2022 is over, it doesn't really matter if it's gym, kilter board or outdoors (as long as the consensus grade is 8A). It's quite far from where I am and I will have to improve tons physically and techniqually if I am to actually make it, but I believe a year is realistic if I'm really dedicated.

Right now, my bouldering grade is around V8 in the gym and on kilter (outdoors was quite a while ago, dunno where I'm at now, but I have a few V9 and V8 projects). So from V8 to V11 in a year.

My weaknesses on the wall is definitely hip mobility and hip work, so that's the lowest hanging fruit I'm gonna start with and tackle by getting the Lattice Flexibility plan.

But getting hip mobility and better hipwork will only be making it on par with my strength for my grade and if I am to get to V11 in a year, I'll have to improve all areas and get a lot stronger aswell as more techniqual. Since strength takes time to build compared to endurance, I was thinking to train max strength (and antagonists not to injure myself) for 6 months until I've reached the average strength benchmarks of a V11 climber so that I will be sure strength is not the limiting factor. I am well aware that benchmarks don't always translate into climbing, but it's one of the few mesurable things that have a pretty strong correlation to climbing grade.

I'm 190cm tall, 72kg
These are my current benchmarks and goals:

150% BW 20mm 7sec hang -&gt; Goal 175%

155% BW weighted pull-up -&gt; Goal 180% 

1-3-5 on standard campus rungs -&gt; Goal 1-4-7

80kg benchpress 1RM -&gt; No specific goal


This layout is what I'm thinking:

 Week 1-2:

- Max hangs 4 sets of 10 sec on 20mm edge at 80% of max, 2 times a week
- Weighted pull-ups 4 sets of 5 reps at 80% of max, 2 times a week
- Antagonists: Benchpress, shoulderpress, tricep pull-downs, nordic hamstring curls, 2 times a week
- Limit board climbing, 1 time a week
- Bouldering in gym,  2-3 times a week
- Core, 3 times a week
- Flexibility/Mobility according to the Lattice plan

 Week 3:

- Max hangs load increased to 85% of max, 2 times a week
- Weighted pull-ups increased to 5 sets, 2 times a week
- Antagonists stay the same, 2 times a week
- Limit board climbing, 1 time a week
- Bouldering in gym,  2-3 times a week
- Core, 3 times a week
- Flexibility/Mobility according to the Lattice plan

 Week 4:

- Max Hangs load increased to 90% of max, 2 times a week
- Weighted pull-up load increased to 85%, 5x5, 2 times a week
- Antagonists decreased to 1 time a week (except for nordic hamstringcurls cause of knee issues)
- Limit board climbing, 1 time a week
- Bouldering in gym, 2-3 times a week
- Core, 3 times a week
- Flexibility/Mobility according to the Lattice plan

 Week 5:

- Deload week
- Bouldering 3 days during the week, keep sessions short (1-1.5h) around flashgrade intensity
- Flexibility/Mobility according to the Lattice plan
- light prehab for shoulders, knees and fingers
- Benchmark on the last day of the rest week

What this might look like in practice is something like this:

Mon: Max hangs, Bouldering, Weighted pull-ups, antagonists, Core

Tue: Rest day

Wed: Max hangs, easy bouldering, technique drills and slab

Thu: High intensity bouldering, Weighted pull-ups, antagonists, Core

Fri: Rest day

Sat: Limit board climbing, Core

Sun: Rest day

I am thinking to repeat this training block with slight variations. Maybe have one block with 2 limit board climbing days and 1 max hang day and another block with 2 campus boarding days and 1 limit bouldering day. But practically this block is my plan for the coming 6 months before I start to work on things like endurance or power endurance. Is that completely outrageous? Will I get diminishing returns if I don't change up the excercises more? Is it stupid to focus this much on strength and power but neglect endurance? Any input on things I can change to reach my goals in a more effective way?

I work at the climbing gym and I can fit training practically into any day of the week, so if you have any input, it would be much appreciated! Thanks!
What are some advanced climbing tips? We all know the videos/articles with titles like "Best 5 beginner tips" and the like. However, what are some advanced climbing tips for someone who has climbed a few years? I came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frhO7-D3fjI), and thats my inspiration for the question.
Training for both bouldering AND sport climbing? Is it possible to train for both bouldering and sport climbing? I’m planning to do a lot of the two this upcoming season. I’ve been looking around for training plans and it seems like the plans are specific to the discipline. Has anyone seen any plans that can be tailored to both? 

I’m currently following a bouldering plan made by one of my gym’s coaches. Power is much more difficult for me to maintain than endurance. However, I feel without regular endurance training I forget how to rest and relax and routes haha. Also, I get scared if I haven’t desensitized myself to heights and falling. My goals are to send V6 and 5.12 outside this season.
Toe hooks with a bent knee I’m 6’4 and have been bouldering a lot at a new gym and notice a lot of their problems have a specific length of toe hook (especially for start moves) so that there is no way I can physically get my leg straight to keep actually decent tension. 
I wouldn’t say I’m a master of toe hooks, but I can keep tension pretty well if I have a straight leg. 
Anyone got any tips/training for doing toe hooks with bent legs?
Help with mindset Hey y'all.

I've been climbing about 3.5 years, with a decent mix of outdoor/indoors and for the last 2 years a primary focus on bouldering. I'm projecting V5-V6 outdoors, and I've realized recently that right now that I don't necessarily need to be training more to reach my goals but rather need to spend more time outside projecting boulders.

However, my mindset is terrible. I suffer from depression, so it's really easy for me to beat myself up if a training session goes poorly, or even after every failed attempt. I don't get on ropes that often, partly because I just find bouldering more fun, but honestly there is also a fear aspect about lead falls and a general lack of confidence.

The main sticking point right now is worrying about the future. I'd like to climb hard during my career, like really hard. I'm about to graduate college, and in the summer of 2022 begin working seasonally as a wildland firefighter, meaning that I won't be able to climb for roughly 6 months out of the year (May through October). On top of that, this career path will be physically and mentally exhausting, and will probably take a significant toll on my body which will ultimately limit my climbing. The thought bums me out, and to compensate I've been taking advantage of living in the city by training hard all winter/last fall so I can get on some harder stuff this summer/next winter before my career starts.

But in the back of my mind, I know that climbing is going to take a backseat someday, and rather soon at that. I worry that I won't reach my full potential. I've suffered two overuse injuries to my pulleys in the past six months on the moonboard, which makes me feel like an absolute dumbass for overdoing it. I know climbing in the grand scheme of things doesn't really matter, and that the point is to have fun, but sometimes its the only thing that motivates me to get out of bed or eat. I have this insane goal of sending a V15 someday, but I realize that this is largely unattainable and feel stupid for even considering it. 

I guess this is kind of a rant, but basically I train hard and try hard outdoors, and I still feel silly, weak, have bad technique and a sore middle finger to boot. Do any crushers have any advice? Sorry in advance if this post reeks of immaturity or isn't really fitting for this subreddit, I'm not great at talking about stuff.
Critique my training plan (V5 climber trying to get into V6) I have been mostly lurking for a while now and trying to get as much information/advice on how to structure a training plan. This year my goal is to tick some V6s and if possible a V7 and try to make my session more focused so I keep improving at a good pace. Due to my location I'm restricted to gym climbing so this goal is not for outside. Where I live we have a couple of gyms, in three of them I can sent most v3-v4s in a couple of tries (or usually flash them if it's my style) but I think the problems are a bit too easy. My go-to gym is a lot harder and I have to project v3-v5s for a couple of sessions. (Sometimes it takes me a couple of weeks because I don't like to project a whole session on one boulder.)


Been climbing (almost exclusively bouldering) since summer '19 with lockdowns in between. Before that I hit some weights in the gym for a couple of months just to build up some general strength. 
***

Hangboard: Never tried my 'max' hang but I did some repeaters (6on10off x5 half crimp &amp; open handed) on Tension HB (20mm) during lockdown which felt alright. 

FL: Can't do the party trick but I can hole a one leg FL for a couple of seconds.


As a climber with only limited experience I think everything is still a weakness: technique, strength, grip, applying tension ... but at my level:

Strengths: steep routes, roofs, pinches

Weaknesses: technique in general, crimps, hip mobility, ...

***

I tried to keep my training plan as simple as possible so I don't  half ass it because I have no motivation or it is too much. As most people I don't like rest days, I like to stay active . The climbing gym has limited equipment so I can't do the antagonist training after the climbing session. 


**In general:**

- Each morning before work I do a mobility session of about 10-15 mins for the hips/lower body.

- I do a daily prehab routine for my shoulders &amp; elbows which consists of the usual: reverse curls, hammer rotations, wall slides, ... Takes around 20 mins.

- I try to do a stretching session 3 times a week.

- I sleep 8-9 hours each day.

- Nutrition is on point, enough protein, lots of water during the day... 

- The timing of each section includes breaks as well. 

***

            Focus on 2-3 moves max of projects in the V6-V7 range with lots of rest between attempts.

If I don't have time Saturday I will drop the core/cardio session Friday and do the antagonist session instead. I love lifting heavy as well so I would love to do some deadlifts or weighted pull ups but I think at this stage it won't really benefit me and it would only mean less recovery/climbing. 

Additional question: I think this is enough volume on the antagonist muscles to not get weaker in that area? 


Thanks in advance for the feedback and suggestions.
What mistake do you see newbies make the most and what advice do you have for people beginning to climb harder? [deleted]
How to project to get better as a boulderer? **TL;DR**

Projecting can mean a lot of different things. Does anyone have a specific description of a kind of projecting that has worked for sustained improvement? Also, does projecting work for attacking weaknesses, or should that be done at lower intensity?

**The longer version**

Longtime lurker here. From reading around on this subreddit and hearing about how some stoked friends have progressed quite quickly, I came to the realization that I should focus more of my sessions on trying harder to try to break out of a plateau, and make pretty much all of my training be “just climb”.

With that in mind, I decided that for most days I am in the gym, I’d “project”, in the sense that I’d work a problem I absolutely couldn’t do in a single session. The thing is, I’m not sure if I’m going about this the right way.

**What my projecting looks like**

Projecting to me means working things that I won’t get in a session, but still seem feasible, and then working mostly those individual problems for the duration of a session. So, for a “do-a-v6-in-a-session” kind of climber like myself, such problems would be anti-style 5-6’s and most 7’s.

I have to really dial these problems to get them to go and they push me hard physically. I do this 3 times a week, and often work problems serially. That is, mostly work one problem until I get it or deem it out-of-reach, then move on.

I’m thinking there may be a better way of going about this. For instance, should I interleave these kinds of projects and have 3-4 going at a time to ensure that a part of my ability isn’t getting neglected? Instead of hopping on problems that I feel like have a good chance of going, should I just try individual moves on v8+? 

Lastly, how should projecting work for developing weaknesses, particularly those dealing with technique? For instance, I know with a 143% 20mm max hang and 165% BW pull up, my pulling ability far exceeds my climbing ability and I need to focus more on mobility and technique. Seems a little hard to give a tricky heel hook my all when I’m also afraid of tearing my groin, though.
Cramps in my feet and calves when heel hooking Just as the title says. Often the inner part of my foot, the one which isn't on the ground when you're standing straight, cramps up when I heel hook, instantly throwing me off the wall. Just to note, this isn't a shoe problem, it has happened while wearing both really loose and really tight shoes. When I do an identical movement, but pull with my leg more aggressively, sometimes my calf starts to cramp and also throws me off the wall. It hurts quite a lot and I need to instantly start strecthing it to make it feel better quicker. It always goes away after a minute or two but completely messes up my attempt.

So my question would be, how and what do I train to prevent this? Now I know a lot of the answers are gonna be "just practice heel hooking and pulling more" but I want to know what's the root of the problem. What is causing the cramping to start, is it the fact my legs are too weak (they are), is it joints, tendons, is the foot too twisted without me actually feeling it, who knows? I am looking for strength building exercises of the legs that might help with this. I also think mobility plays a role here, so something that mimics heel hooking and the twisting of the foot would be very much preferable. Thanks in advance.
Mental State of Trying Hard I've been noticing recently that trying to remain calm and intensely focused on each move of hard problems has been working wonders for me. I guess some sort of mindfulness maybe. In previous times I have gotten worked up in my mind while trying hard and I suspect lost energy because of it

Anyone have any other thoughts/tips for max effort attempts?
MOONBOARD 2016 BENCHMARK GRINDING Hi all!

I'm a 30yo lead climber, right now I can redpoint 8a/+ (5.13b/c) and OS 7b/+(5.12 b/c). I dont really boulder outside too much, I ticked a couple of v7 and v8 but only the most straight-forward ones, which don't involve high heelhooks, compressions or slopers, I'm kinda good at crimps and pockets and that's what I care the most, since my main goal is to climb hard on limestone routes.

Later on I eventually realized that i need more strenght and power to climb harder, so a couple of months ago I strated moonboarding and quickly became hooked on it, and in particular on this benchmark grinding game-like stuff.

Right now I'm sitting on something like 200 benchmarks, did all the v4 and most of the v5, half of the v6, some v7 and 5 v8.

I'd really like any possible suggestion on how to progress forward and how you structure your training on the board. Right now I'm really psyched aobut it and honestly I don't even care how well it will transfer to my climbing, I just wanna climb the f\*\*\*n benchmarks, I like crimps and f\*\*k off the comp-style boulders in the gym :)

It feels like I can still climb some more 30 to 40 problem in a reasonable amount of time with my current level of strenght, but then I'll lbe stuck, needing probably more finger strenght to climb higher.

Right now my typical training session is like 30min warmup ( pullups, pushups, easy hangs, easy climbing, stretching)- 5x max hangs, 10/20min trying the new problems in the gym (if any) then straight to the board for like 60 to 90 min. Here I do always limit bouldering with like 3 to 5 min rest between attempts ( I dont really watch the timer). At the end I do 3 sets of 4 weighted pullups and sometimes abs and core.

Any suggestion on how to progress further will be really appreciated.

Last I'd like to share my view on benchmark grading and see if you agree or not. (I'm talking benchmarks compared to the easiest ad most repeated benchmarks of higher grades, and not moonboard grading vs real rock grading.)

It feels like there's something like a 4 grades stretch between the most and the least repeated problems in a certain grade, and to me the hardest 6b+ took more attempts than the most repeated 7As, same goes for 6c 6c+ and 7a. I can't talk about 7b (V8+) since I climbed only 5 of them and nothing harder

What do you think about it?
How to prepare for a trip to Margalef? Tips on adapting my training plan to be more specific to this area. Hey friends. In about 6 weeks I'll be going to Margalef and I wanted to know if there are any general training tips one might have for getting in shape for the type of routes there, especially when it comes to power endurance type training. I'm also looking to apply that advice in context of the training plans I already have.

I'm currently about 6 weeks deep in a 12-ish week loose training cycle that I had planned to occupy my Jan, Feb, and March gym time and culminate in a peak in early April, so the timing should work well.  So far, I've already trained aerobic capacity and base endurance in January, and currently in a strength phase focusing on hard bouldering and max hangs with weekly progress (this was originally planned to go until March 5). From that point on, I was going to spend the remaining 3 weeks on power endurance but hadn't planned many specific workouts therein other than RP level gym leading and2x/week Hangboard repeaters on a 20mm edge (I would adjust my weight to ensure it hits the correct energy system)

TLDR I'm looking for advice on:

* How would you spend 6 weeks preparing for this crag given the choice?
* Any power endurance style workouts that translate well to Margalef.
* How important are training on pockets for that area? what grips are most important to focus on?

You can see my flair to see that I'm on the weaker side here - I'll probably spend alot of my time in Margalef on 5.11, 12-
Update from guy who wants to climb 8A before the year ends I'm stubborn, I know. But I took yalls advice to heart before jumping on an intense training regime that might end in me getting injured.

I'm going to see a very experienced climbing coach next week to really identify my weaknesses, and I've bought the books '9/10 Climbers' and 'Make or Break' which I've just started reading.

I would still like to climb 8A in a year and will work my hardest to get there, but I will also try to work as smart as I can and not bark up the wrong tree ;) Ty for the advice peeps (but did you have to roast me so hard tho? Goddamn), I'll see you in the next update!

Training the ability to "flip the switch" while climbing for more power or endurance I'm currently focussing on different mental skills for climbing, most recently I've worked on the ability to "flip the switch" and go from switched on (for max pulling power) to off (for efficient climbing) at will. I'm sharing my results in case others are interested, and as always [I made a video for full transparency.](https://youtu.be/MuTcrfP_sAo)

**Psyching up:**  
Switching on led to a +15% in pulling power. I knew 'psyching up' was effective for things like weight lifting from my background in (sports) psychology, but I didn't think it would be this effective! I've since found literature and apparently 6% to 18% increase in strength is quite normal when psyching up. Very good to know for short, powerful boulders!  
*This is how I tested it:* after my normal hangboarding routine I used a crane scale to pull as hard as I could with my left and right hands (I pulled 44kg and 46kg respectively). I then psyched myself up by slapping myself and by using short, powerful breaths, after which I pulled 49kg (+14%) and 53kg (+15%) with my left and right hands respectively.

This boost in power is great and I've never pulled this hard before in my life... But I also should note that I tweaked my A2 pulley by doing this. So yeah... be careful!  


**On/off switch:**  
I'm mainly a boulderer and I don't have any trouble switching on and trying hard. This is fine for most boulders, but on sport climbs I notice that I just can't get back into climbing relaxed and in the flow after a cruxy bit.   
*So I came up with the following exercise:* I made a circuit on kilterboard that consists almost entirely of jugs, with a few nasty crimps in the middle. I place my feet on all the screw on holds. My goal was to start off relaxed, then switch on for the crux, and finally switch off again for relaxed climbing after the crux. This last step turned out to be very hard for me. When I was analysing the footage, I could see myself being super tense and I could hear myself holding my breath. Completely unnecessary, because I was climbing on jugs! 

&amp;#x200B;

It took me several sessions, but things started to click and now I can use my breathing as a cue to switch on or off at will. As a result, ***I saved enough energy to climb an extra lap on the circuit.*** So far, I've only been focussing on the mental aspect so next up I will also try to improve my technique to save even more energy (especially in the crux). I'm pretty sure that I can climb 3 full laps on this circuit, *despite my terrible endurance*. I will still try and improve my endurance, but I this ability to switch on or off will already make a HUGE difference and a whole bunch of new routes just opened up for me. Super excited!  


Anybody else ever try to specifically training this mental skill? How did you do it, and what were the results?
Resting a complete week once in a while I’ve been climbing every other day consistently for close to a year now and have recently sent a v6 outdoors. I’ve gotten a lot of nagging injuries but I usually climb around it and they heal up fine. In fact, i think some of my injuries healed up better bc I kept climbing. I was talking to a friend who is way more experienced than i am, and he said that I’d actually progress even faster (and safer) if i took a week off once in a while even if I dont feel like my body needs it. The longest I've taken off was close to a week (6 days) and came back with a noticeable difference that I was physically weaker, but he’s more experienced than i am and was wondering what others on here think about this?
Does anybody here just climb because they enjoy it? no training, no lifting weights yoga, hangboard nothing. but still progressively punching grades because you don't care what the grade is? [removed]
Improving for Rock on Plastic I feel I am noticing a trend that is counter to my beliefs of performance on rock.  I have always had a strong conviction that hard outdoor sport climbing is a craft only perfected by countless days learning the intricacies while shivering/sweating through seasons at the crag.  However it seems lately that more and more stories are being shared of primarily gym climbers finally making there way to the crag only to immediately achieve the high grades.  The latest story of a young British climber Hamish finding quick progress on La Dura Dura has driven the point home.

**Are others surprised by this easy transition from gym to crag?**  

I am a parent and climbing in the 5.13 range.  Spending more time in the gym and less time at the crag is better for family life but I always worry my flow and fluency on rock will degrade.

**Have others experienced success from biasing time in the gym compared to the crag?**
Does (absolute edge) size matter? Recently I saw some post/discussion by Tyler Nelson of c4hp on pulley insertion points and dead hang edge size. In summary, the "universal" 20mm standard edge might be overemphasized by the community, and for some people going up to 5mm larger could be effective and reduce potential dip tweaks or injuries associated with overuse. I hope I e interpreted that right, for more specifics check his Instagram or the nugget followup interview from last month.

I've personally struggled over the last year to find progress on 20mm, in my opinion mostly due to limited time under tension. I've also experimented with different protocols and have consistently found this edge size to be troublesome. I recently switched to 25mm and I'm feeling like I can consistently get 2 HB sessions a week (whether max or 7:53 which I also like) on top of my normal routine without getting tweaky, which I never felt I could do with max hangs on a 20 more than 1/week.

I'm curious about experiences in the community of going outside the standard edge size and seeing progress or regression. Has anyone put together a solid "theory" on this? Any anecdotes, eg build up strength on 25 and move down to 23 then 20 and consolidate over X months/years, moved up a size and got noticeably weaker on crimps but better on steep routes with bigger holds, whatever, are welcomed! 

Thanks in advance
Just climb if I'm truly weak as hell? Hi all -

I've been climbing for over 3 years now. Spent one season climbing sport outside where my hardest onsight was 10a, redpoint 11b (in ten sleep, so maybe take that with a grain of salt lol). Hardest boulder sent outside was V3. As for indoor metrics, project V5ish in my gym and V4 on the tension board. 

I know there's an abundance of people who blame strength over technique, but the reality is I can't do a single pull-up. 10 pushups is difficult for me. I have watched many of my guy friends with more natural upper body strength who have been climbing less time than me overtake me grade-wise pretty quickly. 

I am hesitant to think that just climbing is entirely working for me. My weakness becomes more clear in moments when I can't rely on strength and support from my legs or moves where I have to "pull hard" or lock off. I have recently started training pullups, inverted rows, pushups, etc. However it does get in the way of climbing time and performance due to fatigue. 

I guess I'm wondering if I'm lacking this much strength if it would be more beneficial to supplement my climbing sessions with light strength training at the end like I've seen recommended here, or to cut back on climbing by a day or two every week and put my focus into getting stronger before I start heading outside again.
Update on using Antihydral Following on from a previous post, I ended up applying antihydral a few nights before, and the night before a sport climbing trip in Croatia. I can happily report back now that it is a gamechanger! Two thin applications toughened skin in a way that would normally take a few days of climbing on rock to create. My skin is usually thin and crap but it held up great on sharp crimps that would normally shred me. I've applied it once since coming back from the trip and my skin feels bulletproof, only wish I had started earlier!
A Chronology and Reflections on My First Three Years of Bouldering Warning, this one’s gonna be long.

**TL:DR** There’s a lot of storytelling and analysis, so if you want just my takeaways, that will happen at the end of every section in the concluding paragraphs and bolded text. I can’t really TL:DR my entire climbing career, but most of the useful information will be found in the more recent (2021-now) sections at the end. That said, the chronology does provide very useful context for interpreting my thoughts. [Here is a YouTube playlist of all the videos of me climbing in this post, sorted chronologically.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHcu_rsRBaw&amp;list=PLfG6NlCnKwEaPtk7lcvde9uoofzzhSZ1Y)

**Preface:** I’m writing this after receiving a good amount of interest in such a post, and hopefully to inspire similar posts of personal climbing logs. It will proceed sort of like a chronology of my climbing progression, with as much data and qualitative commentary that I can muster to go along with. I want to note that this is purely my own experiences and any advice, recommendations, or claims I make are because they are what I find to be true personally. I don’t claim anything will or should work for anyone else, I just want to share my journey so far. With that out of the way, let’s start at the beginning of my climbing career.

The Climbing Club (October 2018 – October 2019)

Shortly after going to college, I found out my university has a climbing wall. I went with friends in September of 2018 to learn how to top rope. A couple weeks later I joined the club and went to a climbing gym for the first time. As with most people reading this, I was immediately hooked. I climbed anything and everything, whether it was tech slab or thuggy cave climbing. I was fortunate enough to have some decently experienced climbers as my peers in the club who were more than willing to befriend me and climb with me. 

Not long after starting, I found myself climbing way too often. I would climb at the school wall 3-4 days a week, for 3 hours each day, then climb 1 day on the weekend at the nearby climbing gyms. In November I had already developed tendonitis in both my elbows (lol), and I remember being physically exhausted at the end of each session. Come December I bought a gym membership and started climbing 5x/week regularly, not letting up until the turn of the year in January 2019. I remember telling my friends to not let me climb with them so that I would be motivated to rest my poor body. Turns out that resting works, and I found out that a 1 on 1 off worked quite well for me (I continue to climb/rest per this schedule). 

Around this time, I was sending ~5.11 at my school wall and ~V4 in the gym. I was pretty much just having lots of fun and found climbing to be a great distraction from school. Most of the harder climbs I sent were either big moves on jugs or pulling on crimps, and I quickly gravitated to a powerful movement style. I had no clue how to use my feet or apply body tension, but then again who does at just a few months in? [Here are some videos of my early climbing. I don’t think it’s worth commenting on any of these since they’re so early in my progression, but if you’re curious check them out.]( https://youtu.be/KHcu_rsRBaw)

My first semester of college passed and my GPA sucked. I didn’t know it yet, but I was about to start partying far too often and go through a breakup. The first several months of 2019 was the lowest place I’d been emotionally in a long time, if not ever. I used climbing as an escape from the brutal school days and hedonistic weekends. My emotional struggles did help in a way though. I was motivated to try working out for the first time, get good at climbing, and in general pursue betterment. I started eating at a caloric surplus for the first time in my life and began yoga at my climbing gym about 2x/week. I went from ~120lbs to ~130lbs around April of 2019. By this point, I had competed in a couple competitions and was introduced to slightly more technical movement. Unfortunately, at one of these competitions I injured my right ring finger A2 falling on a pocket. This injury eventually cascaded to me being weak in pockets to this day, but I’ll discuss that later. I took the recovery time to focus on weightlifting and yoga and reached ~135lbs bodyweight by late May. 

I was now through my first year of college and starting to get to a better place mentally. I felt healthier and more fit than ever (this period of my life is still the best I have ever felt physically), and it’s no surprise considering my diet, sleep, workout routine, and self-discipline were all incredible. [Videos here show some of my climbing around this time period with some in-video commentary.](https://youtu.be/2S27XNH71UQ) I was getting better, and had quite good pulling strength, but I just never knew what to do with my lower body; I never even knew it was a problem. I would overgrip every hold and generate every move through my upper body. But I was never really climbing with a lot of intent or analysis, just for fun. Now that we’re approximately 1 year into my climbing I’ll wrap up this section with stats, things I would change, and what I’d keep the same.

**What I would change:** I started off climbing a lot, which is great, but I climbed *way* too much. I should have listened to my body earlier on, which also might have helped avoid my A2 pocket injury. Not only would that have led to higher quality sessions and better climbing, but I would likely be less scared of pockets today and feel more confident on front/middle two finger holds. 

I was told to keep my arms straight very early into climbing. I internalized this advice and it ruined me. Now when I hear anyone say this, I jump in with a huge caveat about it because of how silly it is to simply tell new climbers to keep their arms straight. Here’s what that advice did for me: I never learned how to pull while slightly bent or locked off. I never learned how to lockoff or develop lockoff strength. I became overly reliant on generating movement through my upper body and thrutching to every single hold. And I had to make every move a test of contact strength and coordination. On the other hand, this allowed me to develop insanely good contact strength, dynamic movement skills, and general power, but at the cost of other movement skills and body strengths. To this day I struggle with slow, controlled movements and lockoffs. As a beginner I didn’t know any better and would “fall into the next hold” instead of “move from x body position to y body position.” Fuck “straight arms”. If you give this advice to someone, please specify why you are telling them to do so. Ditto with silent feet and all the other cliché drills/advice thrown out to novices. [This comment from /u/justcrimp says what I’m trying to say way better probably.](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/pnskoe/climbing_selfassessment_i_made_for_fun_feedback/hcxjki2/)

**What I would keep the same:** My initial psyche, growth mindset, and climbing with people way better than me from the start are incredible advantages. I was told to compete in advanced in my very first competition to see how high climbing’s skill ceiling is, and it was the best advice I ever received. The opportunity for learning in that setting is so much higher than my desire to satisfy an egotistical requirement of a podium. I owe many thanks to my peers at the time, those who pushed me to think about everything in ways I had never thought of, and to learn how to push myself. I would also say getting into lifting, yoga, and counting calories is a huge silver bullet for me. I should really be doing those things now, but I don’t have the time and discipline at the moment. 

**Quantitative stats from Oct 2018 – Oct 2019:**
Unfortunately, I’ve got no logbooks on climbing and no proper stats besides my bodyweight and lifting stats. But I can say I put in about 200 climbing sessions over that year. I went from 120lbs-135lbs. I started at about the 5.9-5.10 and V2 range and was climbing about 5.12 (top-rope) and V6ish at the end. I was still brand new to the sport and climbed everything piss poorly over-reliant on my finger and pull strength. But I was super psyched, and ready to start climbing outdoors.

The Battle Against Mr. Strong (November 2019 – January 2021)

Dave MacLeod released [this video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6HEKzpHKc) about climbing outdoors. I had a few good friends that were interested in bouldering on real rock, so I bought a crashpad off Facebook the next day. That weekend, we drove 2.5hrs to what would become my home crag, Rogers Park. We had one crashpad between 4 people and had no clue about proper outdoor logistics, reading rock, and other outdoor skills; we were just psyched to climb. I ended up doing a couple V4s that day in addition to a few V0-V3 boulders. I immediately fell in love with outdoor bouldering. 

We went out again the next weekend and I snagged my first V5 and a V4 flash. I tried some other V5s and a couple V6s but was enamored by a classic V6 called Senor Fuerte. In January of 2020 I made my third trip outdoors and back to Rogers, intent on sending a V5 and working Senor Fuerte. [Here’s a video of me flailing on the crux section that day.]( https://youtu.be/9xUzDLdZX6g) 

At the time I thought I was somewhat close to sending. I didn’t think it would end up being my longest project ever, taking 12 sessions in total over the course of the next year. Senor Fuerte exposed all my weaknesses in climbing with two simple crux moves: left hand lock off, full sidebody tension, accuracy in shallow two finger pockets, and fully extended body tension while locked off. I knew my pocket strength was lacking, and I knew that compared to my friends my ability to lockoff was far behind my other strengths. But I was convinced I could do the move without getting stronger. I read on this subreddit about people like Dave Graham and Laura Rogora, the benefits of ‘being weak and developing technique first’, and soon told myself that I wanted to be the best weakest climber I knew. 

Let me say, being weak is a blessing and a curse. Sure, I had naturally strong fingers and explosive strength, but in every other regard I was certainly very weak. I couldn’t (and still can’t) bench press over 100lbs, my biceps and triceps were very weak, I never “trained core”, my shoulders were supremely lacking, I had no muscles in my back and especially none in my legs. What I did have going for me was my mobility on the wall, light bodyweight, fingers, and psyche to climb hard. 

The problem is, being weak didn’t necessarily make me a “better” climber as people often claim. The simple truth is I was way too new to climbing for it to have any benefits. Every session I went in to, I came out of marginally better still riding newbie gains. I didn’t learn how to optimize body positions, consider ‘the box’, or get good at heel/toe hooks, camming, kneebars, bicycling or whatever. I instead relied on the strengths that I already had. I knew I could crimp almost anything, I could jump and cut feet on every move but still hold on, I could do insanely high hand-foot matches and power through scrunchy positions. Being weak didn’t help me broadly learn how to move; it taught me how to use the strengths I had and capitalize on what I knew I could do, rather than learning how to do things I couldn’t do. [These videos are great examples of how I moved at the time.](https://youtu.be/4zydZ9r7X44)

Regardless, I was slowly shifting my focus from indoors to outdoors. I had a trip planned during spring break to learn trad climbing in Eldo with a friend/mentor. Unfortunately, that plan fell through, and I ended up bouldering for a few days. By this point I claimed my first couple of outdoor V6s, sent several more V4s/5s and was feeling a little more confident on real rock. As we all know in March 2020, COVID did its thing, and the world went on lockdown.

I was back home and couldn’t stand not climbing. My friend and I did random weighted hangboarding in his apartment, and I found out that I could hang 170% bodyweight from ~20mm for several seconds. That day I realized that by every dataset out there I “should” be climbing around the double digits level. My V6 self was dumbfounded, and I realized that I must suck at climbing to be this strong and not sending that hard. In reality I was still so new to climbing that my movement sucked and I just had 0 skill, but at the time I suddenly had high hopes for myself. My friend and I decided to race to climb V10 by the of 2020. Since I was working in a local climbing gym, I was able to get back to climbing in May, limited to 2x/week 2hr sessions. I continued to randomly hangboard, but never pushed myself and just wanted to stay fit, whatever that means. My friends and I would go climb outside at ungodly hours to avoid people during the pandemic, so fortunately my break from climbing in 2020 was limited to just the month of April. [Here’s a video from June 2020 that perfectly showcases my climbing at the time,](https://youtu.be/u7zwx78wwJo)

Frankly, I generated every move with my upper body, I always stayed square to the wall, I didn’t finish looking at my feet before I placed them, I didn’t move into optimal positions, I fell into every hold, and I power grunted on jugs :). At some point in the summer of 2020 my friends and I ventured to a slightly further gym to try out the 2017 Moonboard set. I was immediately captured by it and the friendly competitiveness of the benchmark system, and soon after made it a goal to climb all the V3-V7 benchmarks. My first session I was able to tick some V3-V6s with a V7 flash. Within the next month I had already hopped on the Moonboard 7 times, and made [this post for advice.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/i3uh6w/critique_my_moonboarding_three_v6v8_boulders_with/) In October I made it a goal to finish every single V3-V5 benchmark I had remaining by the end of the month. I Moonboarded consecutive days in a row and rarely climbed gym sets in favor of completing benchmarks. One day in October I sent 50 benchmarks up to V7, with ~30 or so V4/V5 flashes. My body was wrecked, but I was hooked. 

As I look back on it, Moonboarding did wonders for my strengths. I came out of that board climbing phase stronger, more powerful, and with more application of awkward body positions and body tension than ever. I had a goal in mind to cater to these newfound strengths. A very reasonable looking V10, Free Willy, was a possible tick for my December Hueco trip. I switched over to the Kilterboard as I was satisfied with my progress on the Moonboard, and a more local gym to me had now installed the 2017 Moonboard and a Kilterboard. I set my sights on Kilterboarding to get a little more movement variety in and set a replica of Free Willy’s end sequence to train on before getting on the real thing. I had soon climbed dozens of V7/V8s on the Kilter and was feeling more powerful than ever. I will include a compilation of board climbing and some outdoor climbs around this time in the What I would change section below, because there’s a lot to analyze there.

I spent most of my Fall 2020 semester board climbing and bouldering outdoors 1x/week. By November I had finished all the V3-V6 benchmarks on the 2017 MB, was sending V6-7 outdoors more regularly, and putting down most Kilter boulders in the V7-9 range. I decided to ease off the Moonboarding a bit, as the benchmarks were getting harder and tweakier to climb on so often. I almost exclusively climbed on the Kilter and outdoors leading up to Hueco. From the summer to the end of the year in 2020 I logged about 175 Kilter boulders, most in the V7 range.

I somehow managed to stay injury free leading up to Hueco and all the board climbing made me stronger than ever. My group of four had 4 climbing days for the trip planned on, scheduled as 2 climbing days, 1 rest day, 2 climbing days, leave. None of us had any goals except for having a blast exploring the park and maybe sending Free Willy. Day 1 we went up the chains to climb several V0-V2s and found where the Martini Roof and other areas were. Day 2 we headed to Sign of the Cross, sent that and worked on Choir Boys Lite, and then tried to fathom Power of Silence, Terremer, and Diaphanous Sea, the latter of which I would come back for a year later. On our rest day we travelled to El Paso and discussed how incredible the past two days of climbing were. We had already fallen in love with Hueco. 

Day 3 was the big day for me to send V10 before the end of the year. I warmed up by flashing Bloody Flapper and Lip Sync, then went around the rock to start working Free Willy. The first two moves were tricky but not necessarily difficult, and my friend and I worked out microbeta to make them feel more secure. The middle section felt like a breeze; my replica on the Kilterboard was harder than the actual middle moves of the boulder and replicated the movement very well, so I felt quite confident up to the dyno. After about an hour I started pulling on the upper crimps to try the dyno. It was big, and I could get close in isolation, but every attempt wore my already beaten skin down further. I decided to start giving it send goes and try as hard as I could anytime I made it to the dyno. I was soon getting to the last move reliably but couldn’t quite get the distance to latch the finish hold. I knew that day was my only chance of sending, since I didn’t want to go off on my own the last day. I taped around the heel loops of my shoes to make the heel hook feel more secure, taped the ripped Velcro strap down, put my earbuds in and played hype music on max volume. I forcefully inhaled and exhaled on the moves I needed to and cranked on every hold as hard as I could. [One huge power scream later and I was topping out Free Willy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp7K-Q7GrNA)

I’ll let the video speak for itself for how excited I was :). Later that day we travelled over to Daily Dick Dose and Babyface, determined the former is the easiest V7 in the park, and the latter is the hardest V7 we’d ever tried. Day 4 in Hueco we were all exhausted but checked out See Spot Run and a couple other areas. I sent See Spot in a couple goes and we decided to head in early to save our bodies from destruction. After that trip I felt liked I’d fallen in love with climbing again. I was more motivated than ever to get better, especially seeing how I single-sessioned V10 before sending V8/9. I wanted to get way better at my weaknesses, send more volume in the V6-V8 range, and finally felt ready put down a certain nemesis boulder of mine. 

Senor Fuerte was still waiting for me. My friends and I made a trip out to Rogers in January 2021 for our first bouldering day on rock post-Hueco. The whole time I thought it was funny that I’d sent V10 but was now 12 sessions in to a V6. We warmed up and immediately went straight to Senor. I pulled straight on to the crux, fired it easy, and dropped before the topout. My friend and I discussed a couple small tweaks to make, and suddenly two minutes later I was topping out ([Unfortunately no send footy, so here’s a compilation of me failing](https://youtu.be/v0Tkn3mR5ps)). I remember thinking it felt it easy. How had I struggled for so long on that crux? Why was I able to do it first go today? I hadn’t tried it since October. Had the board climbing made me that much stronger, or was I just a little bit better? I still don’t know the answers to those questions. What I do know is that 2020 was a year of massive progression in my climbing, and I wanted to make 2021 the same. 

**What I learned:** Climbing on real rock is the shit. If I didn’t live in Texas, I would replace 90% of my gym sessions with outdoor bouldering. Learning how to climb on chossy, sandbagged limestone hardened me up with how unforgiving it was. After just a few outdoor sessions, I was way more confident on route-reading, footwork, and techniques you don’t see in the gym often: heel-toe cams, techy toe hooks, super unique microbeta, grabbing holds in unique ways etc. I learned how to try hard and push through pain (a healthy amount), an ability I still like to think I’m decent at. I learned more about my body: what I can do with proper warmups, what I should/shouldn’t expect to be able to do fresh, my weird abilities that make me, me. I learned projecting tactics, and while not optimized at this point, I felt confident in my ability to make climbing trips and plan accordingly. 

**What I would change:** I took the weakness mindset too far. The title of this section is a double entendre: Senor Fuerte, meaning literally “Mr. Strong”, and the battle against both that boulder and my want to stay weak but climb very hard. Don’t get me wrong, I got sucked into board climbing and it made me super strong, obviously. But it made me very one-dimensionally strong. If your goal is to be a board climber, or a floater on crimps at 45°, or you just have the most fun in this style of climbing, then do exactly what I did. I did have a lot of fun on the boards and sending Free Willy, but my real goals required being a better all-around climber and not hyper-specialized. Looking back, I also probably wasn’t willing to admit at the time that *I was really strong*, I just thought of strength in the wrong ways. I could 1-4-7, hang 170% bodyweight on 20mm, and do other stupid strong stuff. I was heinously strong at grabbing and pulling, but nothing else. 

I went too hard on the board climbing. This one is weird, because I fully attribute it to me sending Free Willy, but what did I learn from that send? Well, I learned how to send Free Willy. Sure, I reached my goal of V10 in two years of climbing. But in the long run that didn’t make me anywhere close to a better rounded-out climber, let alone a “V10 climber.” Moonboarding got me very strong, but what it didn’t do was help anything else I was already bad at. I still didn’t know how to climb on slopers or pockets, how to do techy heelhooks and toe hooks, how to be as solid through my lower body as I was in my upper body, or anything that didn’t involve “grab this heinous hold and yard to the next heinous hold.” I could have reduced my board climbing, strength trained my weaknesses, and done volume on anti-style boulders in the gym. Basically, I could have rounded myself out to prepare myself for hard bouldering, and I’m still confident I could’ve sent say V8 at Hueco that year. I let my goal of V10 get in the way of true progress. It led to one of the most incredible feelings of my life (again, refer to the last 30 seconds of that send video), but also one of the most fleeting feelings of my life. [Here’s a compilation of videos that I think showcase me being very strong while lacking in other areas. You can see me flailing a bit on moves I’m not comfortable with.](https://youtu.be/zfX_OPhaI6w)

Looking back, I could have made minor strength gains (like say benching 1-2x/week to get to bodyweight, or easy lockoff training) to round out my body more. I would have been able to apply myself much more on the wall if I had the base strength to do so. There is certainly a balance to be struck here. You don’t want to be digging into a recovery hole, or replacing time on the wall with strength training, especially if you’re still seeing newbie gains from climbing. But if you are so weak in certain areas that it works to your deficit (my mantles and lockoffs for example), why not train those areas and go apply your new gains on the wall? I could have hit a couple weaknesses for a few months at a time and rode those results straight into a volume of harder sends. 

Last, I would get more hard bouldering done on the Kilter instead of volume. Volume is great, but when 95% of your sends are flashes, you’re probably not trying enough hard stuff. This is hard to do because on the Kilter there are *so* many climbs at every angle that you’ll always find something fun. But I could’ve at least replaced 1 session a week with harder boulders.

**What I would keep the same:** Frequency of outdoor bouldering. This was huge. Some weeks I was getting outside 2x/ week, and I almost never missed more than two weeks without climbing on rock. Living in central Texas this is tough to do, but I’m lucky to have plenty of friends and partners willing to do 2-4hr drives during weird times just to touch rock. Whenever I went outside, I made sure not to be too shortsighted: if it was a hard project day, I would at least send a few V0-V2s or do a highball topout. If it was an exploration day, I would try to flash boulders and go without video/written beta to enhance my skills. If you’re still new to outdoor climbing (&lt;100 sessions on rock I’d say, which is still me), make sure you keep it varied just like gym climbing. There is so, so much to learn from nature.

Working my way up through the Moonboard benchmarks by grade was very beneficial. I learned how the board climbs, nuances of the holds, and general style trends on the easier climbs before I went and pushed myself on the harder ones. Not only that, but limiting myself to VcurrentBenchmarkGrade+2 meant I was rounding out a lot of the benchmarks I was bad at before sending all the VnearMax benchmarks that I’d be good at. Which boulder would I learn more from: the V6 with a technical heel and tricky positions that took me 3 sessions, or a V8 with downpulling crimps that I can send in 5 goes? Obviously the former. What I should have done is apply this to my climbing in general, but oh well it was fun.

And lastly just that, having fun. I had a lot of fun climbing in 2020. I went from 2 outdoor sessions to around 35, I climbed on boards for the first time which generally suit me, I travelled multiple states to go climbing, I camped and experienced nature with good friends, and I very much stayed in a beginner’s mindset. I knew that sending V10 was pretty good, but I could very well fall on V1 slab right after. Laughing at that instead of feeling frustrated (“I *should* be able to do this”) is key to having fun.

Heatseeking Missiles (February 2021 – September 2021)

I had a few small goals for 2021: push my max grade to V11/12, train my weaknesses for the first time, incorporate basic strength/conditioning training, and get stronger on pockets. Remember how I said an early pocket-related injury led to me being weak in pockets? That still isn’t fixed unfortunately. My middle two on either hand is very weak, and just hanging from a bar middle two leads to pain in my forearms and tendons. I avoided two-finger pockets whenever, opting to stack three fingers, crimp the edges, or resort to front two if needed. I still do this, in fact, because I never trained my pocket strength during this time :(. I also never actually began a simple strength training routine. So, looking back I failed two of my four goals pretty early on.  

What I didn’t fail was training my weaknesses and pushing my max grade. I spent the first few months of 2021 either Moonboarding to finish the V7 benchmarks, Kilterboarding, or climbing on anti-style gym sets. I was able to send my first V8 on rock in February but wouldn’t climb outdoors again until April. Soon enough I had just one V7 benchie left: Fuzzy Socks Don’t Match. Like Senor Fuerte, Fuzzy Socks is a ridiculously hard boulder for me. I knew it would be my last V7 before I even finished the V6s, and only because of the finish cross move. I tried it every Moonboard session but eventually decided to ease off the Moonboard in favor of the Kilterboard. In February I nabbed my first V10 on the Kilter, with a bit more volume in the V8/9 range. 

In April I was able to get my second V8 on rock, but realizing the weather was about to get very bad, opted to stay inside until the summer was over and train weaknesses for the first time. Around this time /u/fishmansnips made a post about free coaching on this subreddit, and he was kind enough to reply with a few thousand words over email filled with advice and specific drills for me. For hangboarding, he recommended max hangs 2x/week at 80% of my max for 8 sets. For improving my shoulder strength/stability and one-arm lockoffs he recommended IYTs, Skin the Cats, kettlebell press, and holding lockoffs on each arm, all 2x/week. 

Within a few weeks I was able to newbie gains my way to a 180% bodyweight hang on 20mm. However, I didn’t like how hangboarding cut into my climbing time, and considering my already good finger strength, I dropped the max hangs. The one-arm work and shoulder strengthening did wonders for me. It was now the start of summer and I picked up a summer camp coaching gig, which made this the busiest summer of my life. I would help run camp for several hours each weekday, train or climb afterwards, then come home and crash to do it again. 

In June I had a bouldering trip to Colorado planned with my friends. We had four climbing days and planned on getting out to Independence Pass, Guanella Pass, and then somewhere in the Front Range. My goal was to flash (not really, but it didn’t look too bad) Dark Horse for my second V10. We drove to Indy Pass on day 1, and I put down several in the V3-V6 range and my third V8. Day 2 we drove up to Guanella and immediately fell in love with the area. I didn’t flash Dark Horse but sent it after about an hour and a half, and satisfied with my goal, headed to support my friends on whatever they wanted to climb. As I said, we fell in love with Guanella, and decided to spend our last two bouldering days out there at night in the cool alpine air. I saw some people working Crimping Matters V10, and with my fingers feeling pretty good after a rest day, decided to join in. It took two back-to-back sessions and several hours, but I eventually sent late at night on the last day. Projecting that boulder was a huge learning experience with meeting random crushers and working it with them and my friends. Here is [my send of Dark Horse](https://youtu.be/zr8GgUpOBJE) and here is [my send of Crimping Matters](https://youtu.be/cSkS13lrKqY)

That trip was a huge boost in my confidence. Instead of just sending one perfectly-styled V10 that I trained for, I was able to do another two in one trip, one without pre-planning at all. I also got a good amount of volume in the V4-V7 range. Now back in Texas and unable to climb outdoors, I knew that putting my head down and getting work and training done would pay massive dividends in the fall when I could climb on rock again. I was still very busy because of work and lacked energy to climb more than 1-2x/week over the course of the summer. I kept training my shoulders and lockoffs though, and was motivated by /u/fishmansnips to get better at my weaknesses: 

“You need to broaden your climbing diet. OK, you climbed V10. Summer, while its hot, is time to make sure you can climb V8-9 in every single style, to prepare you for climbing a whole bunch of hard boulders next season…. For hard climbing, I want you to become a heatseeking missile for slopers, compression climbing &amp; tricky-looking problems. Embrace the humility of sucking at it at first…”

These are the words I needed to hear but didn’t want to admit. Looking back, he was totally right, and this did wonders for my development. My friends and I started calling boulders “heatseeking missiles” if we knew they would be hard for us or anti-style. I began to target those instead of powerful crimp lines. Combined with dropping board climbing and strength training, I made pretty good gains over the summer. Unfortunately, I don’t have any quantitative data to support this. I can say that my upper body “chain” felt stronger on the wall, I felt more secure in arms-spanned positions, I was more confident on gastons and overhead underclings/gastons, and I was starting to do lockoffs with more precision and control. When the fall semester of my senior year started, I dropped the camp coach gig and shifted to coaching a casual youth team 2x/week. I was still very busy with school and work but could now climb 2-3x/week and start getting outside again.

I made my first trip back to Rogers in late September and was very successful. I put down my first two V9s in the same session, one of them an extension of Senor Fuerte. I also picked up Kilterboarding again, and I didn’t notice back in 2020, but I had never spent longer than 1-2 sessions on any Kilter boulder despite having about 100+ V7-9 ticks. I could have been using my time more wisely to project harder, but my mentality at the time was “I’m a V7 climber, anything above V8+ is too hard for me.” Realizing that my logbook was very heavily skewed towards flashes, I started trying harder climbs.

By this point I had done my first V10 flashes on the Kilter and started sending a few V11s. It seems like a big jump, but I had been flashing in the V6-V8 range on the Kilter for a year and a half at that point. I was happy but wanted to put down a V12 before weather started to improve for climbing on rock. I chose to project Plus Minus One at 50 degrees because it only features one proper hard move. [I waged war over the course of 5 sessions, and on session 6 did the thing.](https://youtu.be/XL9Mw1JbAzQ)

**What I learned:** Training works. Maybe this is obvious to a lot of people, but it wasn’t to me as a noob to training. If you can identify a weakness, create a plan to overcome/strengthen it, and can do so without detriment to your climbing performance, you should train. This is especially true if you have massive potential newbie gains like I did in my shoulders and one-arm strength. I need to be applying this right now for pockets, but because I’m lazy and “training isn’t fun” I don’t.

Confidence is key. The number of times I walked up to a heatseeking missile boulder expecting to fall immediately or make a project out of it, and then proceed to send within several tries, was surprising. I wasn’t as bad at my weaknesses as I thought; I just never exposed myself to them. Lacking confidence on a V7 sloper-compression problem might lead me to not even try it and instead flash a V9 crimp line, when I could very well develop more as a climber from actually learning the V7. Be humble when approaching an “easy flash” and confident when approaching a heatseeking missile.

Sometimes you just suck at a boulder. Senor Fuerte took me 12 sessions, Fuzzy Socks Don’t Match took me at least that many and probably ~100 attempts. Free Willy took me 1 session. Which of these boulders made me a better climber? Well, all of them of course, but which helped me the *most*? Certainly not Free Willy. Sometimes you just suck at a boulder, and that’s okay, because when you suck at something it means you have something to learn. Right now I’m sucking at a V9 compression bloc in Oklahoma. I get frustrated every time I go out there and fall on the exact same move since day 1. In the moment I’m upset, because I feel that I “shouldn’t” have to 5+ session a V9. Well, I “shouldn’t” have had to 12 session a V6 either. But I know looking back that learning Senor Fuerte led to great teachable moments for myself about my body and the types of tension I was bad at. The same will apply when I look back after sending that V9.

**What I would change:** Replace the max hangs with front two/middle two strength/rehab and stick with it until sufficient improvement. I knew before I even started that I didn’t need max hangs. I also knew my pocket strength was *severely* lacking. But because it’s my biggest weakness, and no-hanging pockets with my current strength feels shameful, I didn’t. 

Replace those Moonboard grind sessions with more useful sessions. I could have done literally anything else and made better gains in that time than slowly grinding the last couple V7 benchies. I could have done them eventually, but I was caught up in the Moonboard ranking against friends and completing my goal of all the V3-V7 benchmarks done. Getting a couple months’ head start on heatseeking missiles or limit bouldering would likely have been more beneficial.

Continue training shoulders/one-arm until the end of the year. I stopped because school had started up again and I anticipated being busier. I was less busy and could climb more than I did in the summer. Replacing a climbing day, or cutting one in half and training, would probably have finished out my newbie gains for what I was working on. I really had no reason to stop other than *thinking* I should stop, which looking back, I regret doing. 

**What I would keep the same:** Perhaps the easiest, most effective thing I started doing during this time was video myself climbing. Not only videoing, but doing proper analysis and introspection on why a move would work one way and not another, or what I did differently on outdoor sends versus send burns. For board climbing and popular outdoor climbs it’s easy to compare yourself to other climbers. But comparing yourself to yourself, and especially your past self, is far more productive. I now have hundreds of videos of myself climbing, most of them short attempts, stored on my computer and separated by location/crag/boulder/send. In climbs I repeat, or especially board climbs, I like to compare my current self to my past self. See [my last post about Moonboarding on this subreddit.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/omc2qn/movement_and_technique_selfanalysis_1_year_of/)

Didn’t mention this yet, but in February of 2021 I started routesetting at my college. I always knew I wanted to get into but couldn’t find an opportunity until then. My amateur routesetting experience brought about a newer way of considering climbing movement and expanded my athletic empathy. Since we only set a few times per semester, it doesn’t dig into potential climbing or training sessions when planned around. This combined with youth coaching really broadened my mind to more critical thinking about movement, which is never a bad thing. 

Heatseeking missile climbing. Have I said enough about this already?

Post finalized in a top-level comment below, “Embracing the Suck.”
Becoming a climbing physiotherapist Currently second year physio student in the UK, interested in the possibility in specialising in climbing. Wondering if anyone knows if I would require qualifications or extra education to specialise in climbing or if it would just be a matter of finding work in areas such as musculoskeletal or working on hands?
Progression through grades A common question: I climb Vx, I flash 90% of Vx-1s, send Vx in 1-3 sessions, and Vx+1 feels impossible.  

Cool.  Most people have exactly this experience in the gym, and it’s true at a variety of grades.  V1 is easy, V2 is doable, V3 is impossible.  V10 is easy, V11 is doable, V12 is impossible.  In the gym, there is usually a very narrow gap between flashable and impossible.

This is largely due to the nature of setting boulder problems in the gym.  The ideal is to force a single beta, that works for 95% of people reasonably well, and reasonably similar difficulty.  This lends itself to doing lots of problems quickly because there isn’t a lot of room for nuanced micro-beta and creativity.  If you can read the sequence, and you can do the moves, you can do it quickly.  This also means that there is very little room to super-project yourself up something harder than your session grade.  

Climbing in the gym also promotes poor tactics.  Holds are ergonomic, rapid-firing attempts is convenient.  Switching problems after a handful of tries is standard.  

Solutions: 

* climb outside.  
* Set your own problems on a spray wall.  
* Limit boulder on those Vx+1s, do perfect repeats on the Vxs.  Work on moves in isolation.  
* Study which Vxs (and Vx-1s) feel disproportionately difficult, and focus on that style.  Study which Vx+1s feel disproportionately easy, and focus on that style.  
* Be that weirdo that times rests and camps out on one problem for an hour.  And brush your holds….  
* Have a plan for your sessions, and stick to it.  


Also, get stronger.  Sending harder in the gym ultimately is about strength and fitness, because the skill and tactics aspect of climbing performance are intentionally limited by good setting.

As you improve, progress will slow and get much more vague.  It’s important to have some benchmarks for performance that don’t rely on the random-ish grades that setters assign to problems.  Climbing outside or on a board regularly is vital to accurately measuring improvement.

[9 out of 10 climbers make the same mistakes - training for climbing — DAVE MACLEOD](https://www.davemacleod.com/shop/9outof10climbers)
Bouldering on flat edges and slopers is the most underrated form of power training The title pretty much says it all, but I'll elaborate a bit here.

When training on positive holds, you'll always have the option of pulling into the wall, locking off, and otherwise finding ways to slow down the move. You can minimize this by making the moves larger, the holds smaller, or setting awkward positions, but in each case there's a trade-off. Even an experienced climber, with a history of setting problems, will find it hard to set *actually good* power problems on incuts. Obviously it's possible, and that's a good skill to acquire, but it's a lot of work (and it's very easy to end up just setting jump problems).

Conversely, negative holds—un-pinchable slopers and flat-ish edges—make it trivial to set power problems. Removing thumb catches and biting edges forces you to engage very quickly on the hold, training contact strength, and reduces your ability to slow down moves using your trailing hand. Additionally, your balance, timing, and foot-to-hand transition of momentum must be much more precise on negative holds, which punish you instantly for poor technique. For obvious reasons, you're also punished more severely for badly executed foot cuts. And, believe it or not, setting this style allows you to use fairly generous and skin-friendly holds, reducing tweakiness while still allowed you to train your fingers. (One caveat, though, is that it's easier to dry/wet-fire off these holds.)

If you've ever done a sit start on slopey edges, you know what I'm talking about. And if Aidan Roberts is to be believed, it's also a big part of what make Burden of Dreams so goddamn hard.

Lastly, a practical benefit is that it's trivial to set good trainers using negative holds. Take the simplest left-right 40° crimp ladder, one that's "easy" if you've got the requisite finger strength, and swap out every hold for a flat edge—bam, you've got one hell of a movement and power trainer. Very useful for the home wallers out there!

So, if you're thinking of incorporating power training and not sure where to start, try this first: go to your local spray wall or board and set a basic sit start problem on completely flat edges. I'm willing to bet it'll kick your ass, in a fun and specific way (and probably keep you off the campus board).

**Context:** Last year I (re-)built an 8x12 woody at my home filled mostly with wooden grips. My last woody was smaller (6x10) and basically just littered with bad crimps, which was great but left me wanting a bit. I'm making much more of an effort with this one to set intentionally, with the goal of addresses my weaknesses.

In the past, I struggled to set problems that *really* punished bad movement and timing. Inevitably, my first sends would include foot cuts, and only after adding intro moves or practicing the problem would I be able to send them without cutting. I really wanted to figure out how to set problems that simply didn't allow foot cuts.

That led me to setting with flat edges (especially Tension's). They worked brilliantly for that purpose, but I also noticed the other advantages described above. In comparing this experience to my past power training experiences with the Moon Board (7C+ peak, multiple 7Cs) and campus boarding (1-5-8 all-time PR), I prefer this new method.

It also reminds me that, when I first started out, the best climbers at my gym would train exactly this style on the gym woody. (And often with added weight, which is another story — weight vests are another killer power-training intervention, just not as generally useful as this one.) They didn't / maybe couldn't articulate *why* it worked, but now… I get it.

**Disclaimer:** I'm not saying to *never* train power on incuts, which obviously is silly. Many problems require you to be able to generate powerfully to a small hold, latching it in the proper grip in order to make the next move. You also need to be able to isolate on holds statically, whether positive or negative. I'm just elevating the positive/negative dichotomy as a really useful lens through which to see and organize aspects of training.
Longevity in climbing? Do you guys think that there is a lot of longevity in climbing? 

I’ve only been climbing a year and only indoors so I haven’t been exposed to much of the climbing community yet but from what I can tell it would seem that you can climb often and even quite hard until your older days? 

Is it realistic to think that if you live a healthy lifestyle (diet, sleep, low stress etc) that you could train 4x week in say your 60’s? 

Looking forward to hearing everyone’s input 

Thanks
I followed a 6 week training program and improved my route climbing and bouldering - here’s my results and review At Christmas I received a copy of Eric Hörst’s Training For Climbing. After pouring over it for two weeks, I decided to write a training plan to see how much improvement I would see by incorporating some of the techniques and methods he outlines in the book. 

The program lasted for 6 weeks, and was broken up into 3 periodised blocks. The first block lasted 3 weeks and focussed on maximum strength and power. The second block lasted 2 weeks and was aimed at improving strength and power endurance. The final week was somewhat less intense, with a focus on endurance while tapering down the workload for performance the following week.

Here is the link to the program. 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h1pEJAwH7pyl63prctNEeZIrNzfk8fwq0CHRnv5_4a8/edit

The first tab was just for tracking my workouts. (I’m such a sucker for a check box.) The 2nd-4th tabs represent each phase of the program. The remaining tabs contain a selection of workouts I use for push, pull, legs and core training.

At the start of the program I measured my finger strength, power endurance, and max pull up strength using the Finger Strength Testing Session, Max Moves Test - Foot on campus, and Pull Up Testing Session respectively on the Crimpd app.

At 71.6kg bodyweight my max added weight with half crimp for 7secs was 17.5kg, max moves was 122secs, and max added weight with 2RM pull-up was 45kg.

At the end of the 6 week program my bodyweight was 73.1kg, with max added weight with half crimp for 7secs at 20kg, max moves at 166secs, and max added weight with 2RM pull-ups at 55kg.

In terms of the more difficult, but more important, things to measure, prior to starting the program I climbed my first 7a indoors on top rope, but was regularly climbing 6c and 6c+, 6b on lead, and 6A+ benchmarks on the 2019 Moonboard set, though I hadn’t done anything harder and would really struggle with many of the 6Bs. 

During these 6 weeks I’ve climbed 3 more 7as on top rope, and in the week following climbed my first 7b on top rope. I’ve also climbed all but 1 of the 6A+ benchmarks, 4 6B BMs, 2 6B+s and 1 6C BM. I’ve just started working a 7a lead route and made good progress in one session.

I’m really pleased with the improvement I’ve seen in a short amount of time relative to how long I’ve been climbing. It’s very difficult to identify a causal relationship and know exactly why I improved in the ways I did, and I’m under no illusion that there is a magic training formula to follow that will create consistent improvement in all people. In fact I’m unsure how much of this improvement can be attributed to the program itself and the exercises and methods that were employed. I’d like to present some of my thoughts about the program itself, how it felt, what I liked, what I didn’t like, and what I’d do differently.

Some background about me first. I’m 27 years old, 185cm tall, I typically fluctuate between 71-74kg depending on time of day, water retention and how much I’m training. I’ve always been active, participated in many sports, and enjoyed strength training. I began strength training seriously when I was 18, and saw some big increases in muscle mass and strength relative to my size. I started bouldering when I was 20 with some friends, but was never climbing more than once a week for a month or so at a time. As my interests changed so would be training focus, whether that was more body building, power lifting, CrossFit, martial arts, or calisthenics oriented. Point being, for those first 5 years I wasn’t climbing often, and would regularly go months and a few times up to a year without climbing, though I was always doing some sort of strength training, usually some sort of calisthenics-inspired bodyweight training.

At the start of 2020 I moved to Denmark. With more free time from a relationship that was no longer long distance, I began climbing at my local bouldering gym. Aside from the times that the gyms have been shut due to the pandemic, I’ve pretty consistently climbed once a week since the start of 2020. I’ve always quickly regained lost ground and reached the point outlined at the start of the program, but struggled to break into more advanced problems and routes. I really enjoy all things training, and I spend far too much time listening to podcasts, watching videos and reading research papers and books about training for all sorts of sports. For this reason I think I’m already predisposed to benefit from following a training program. I’ve already had positive results following training programs for other goals, and I’m positively biased towards the effectiveness of following a training plan that I understand and believe will yield the results I’m looking for. This could’ve affected my improvements, at least because I’ve already learnt to consistently follow a training plan to completion.

Overall I was positively surprised how easy it felt to follow this plan. I expected that I’d very quickly feel like my fingers were overtrained, but the training load felt achievable throughout. I enjoyed having a goal that I was working towards, which in turn increased the total amount of time that I spent climbing per week, which alone could account for a lot of improvement. I shared my goals with my friends, who also participated with the training with me when we’d climb together, though none of them followed the full plan. The extra motivation and accountability from sharing my goals and having people to train with will absolutely have contributed to the outcome. I feel a noticeable difference in ability when climbing alone vs climbing with my good friends who are also strong climbers, many of them stronger and more technical than myself. 

I enjoyed the hangboard protocol used in the max strength and power phase. I found it challenging, but found that with the long rest times I was able to recover sufficiently between reps to keep performing at my max for those 7 seconds. I found that the position itself was challenging due to some pain in my left shoulder, but was able to find a shoulder/arm angle and amount of scapular retraction that worked well enough. I felt like the discomfort of the position was often more of a limiting factor than my fingers. For example with the final max hang test I did, I was able to add more weight but wasn’t able to hold the position for more than 5 seconds due to my left shoulder. Generally though I found that there were a lot of pretty quick neurological adaptions to hangboarding resulting in my half crimp feeling stronger, and I was able to keep holding on in spite of the feeling of discomfort. I know very well to be careful to push limits when training, but this was simply a case of getting used to the feeling of holding something that feels too small but is actually achievable. I’ve been doing a lot of shoulder strength and stability training already, but there’s something about the overhead position specially that I find difficult with my left shoulder. I suspect there’s a lack of mobility there, I’ll try incorporating some more dead hangs, single arm dead hangs, and scapula retractions to strengthen my shoulders in this position. 

In the more endurance focussed phases I didn’t find the hangboarding so beneficial. I don’t think I was able to find the right intensity to provide the desired stimulation, as it either felt too challenging with the shorter rest periods on the 20mm holds, or too easy on larger holds. I tried adding weight while using the larger holds but felt that in the pockets on the Beastmaker 1000 I was just using a lot of skin friction and not training my finger flexors. I tried using less of the hold, but ended up just using 20mm of the hold, which was too challenging. There’s something there to figure out with timings, holds and weight to hit the anaerobic lactic system on the hangboard.

I felt throughout the entire program that the campus exercises prescribed were too challenging for me to safely and consistently make progress. Again this was an issue of finding the Goldilocks conditions with exercise choice, rung size and modifications. I found that doing single arm bumps up the rungs felt safe enough that I could do several sets. It was too difficult to maintain good form, particularly with shoulders and elbows, with all of the laddering exercises. I tried them for the first 4 sessions, but began feeling a little pain in my shoulders and brachialis. I continued with the campus exercises, but tried to replicate the movement and intention with some sort of modification. For example in order to train max pull power, rather than doing 1-3-5-7 ladder on large rungs - which caused aforementioned pain due to pulling from an overextended position, I would match hands before pulling powerfully up with alternating hands. These sorts of small modifications made the training safer and reduced the difficulty enough that I could make traction with them. I don’t think I’m currently at a level at which campus board training is an appropriate training stimulus. There are several alternatives for developing max strength and power that would be both safer and more effective for me right now. As I get stronger I may reach a point that campus training on boulder problems, for example, isn’t challenging enough to produce strength and power improvements, at which point I could try incorporating campus board training.

I performed the climbing related training on the same day as climbing, as I don’t have the facilities at home, and I only have two free evenings per week. This meant that instead of climbing for 3 hours as I typically would, I would climb for 1.5 hours and then train for 1.5 hours. I think based on my current level that spending more time climbing and reducing the training time slightly would be more beneficial. While it has been useful to incorporate some finger and grip strength training, I think that spending more time working on technique drills, such as developing footwork, would be best for me right now. I don’t think I’ve gained all I can gain from climbing and that I need to invest so much time in climbing specific training.

Another factor that has made a huge difference to my route climbing has been developing some projecting skills. I’ve begun working on projecting problems above what feels immediately achievable. Several of the 7as and certainly the 7b felt impossible the first time I pulled on. For example, when I tried the 7b for the first time it took me 10mins just to figure out how to do the first move and get off the ground. It must’ve looked hopeless. However I now expect to struggle and my goal is just try to work out some beta, and I’ll cheat between moves to conserve energy when figuring out the sequence. I spent about 25mins on the rope trying all the moves, and though I fell many many times, I was eventually able to do all but 2 moves in isolation. I then rested and belayed my friend. I then tried it again and was able to climb almost half way up continuously, fell at the crux, and was then able to climb the top half in two parts, with a fall due to pump rather than difficulty. The following session 3 days later, on my first attempt I climbed continuously through my previous high point and fell with 4 moves remaining. On the second attempt I fell on the penultimate hold with 2 moves left. On the 3rd session, one week after my original try, I climbed it on my first attempt. So much of that is because of taking the time to figure out a sequence and then refine it and practice it. I take photos and videos of the route so that I’m able to review the beta on rest days, and I’ve been able to start visualising my routes really well, to the point that I had the entire route memorised. When I came to climb it on that third session I climbed very quickly and efficiently, I rested when I planned to for the length of time I predetermined, and there was no point at which I hesitated to decide what I would do next. I think this has been a huge factor in my success in route climbing. 

Moving forward, I’d like continue some sort of finger flexor max strength training on my climbing days, whether that be a strength focussed hangboard protocol, or no hang pulls. I’ll reduce the amount of climbing specific training so that I have more time during my session to climb and practice technique. This means more time to project, perform technique drills, and train on the climbing wall. I think until I’m much stronger, move more efficiently, read beta better, and project more effectively, that spending more time training at the expense of climbing would be inappropriate and less effective. 

It’s been a really useful experience and it’s been good to experiment with some training methodologies and expose myself to different exercises. I have a better idea how I currently react to different training stimuli, and I believe I better understand my weaknesses and areas that require focus. I’ve identified some low hanging fruit as a result of this program, and I’m confident I can continue to improve. 

Please feel free to ask any questions! Happy training!

EDIT: In the about me section I made a mistake with my weight, it originally said 61-64 but should’ve been 71-74. So sorry! Lesson learned, don’t proof read late at night.
Coaching - worth it or not? I know that it’s case dependant. And that there’s many variables to consider.

BUT anyone who’s had coaching:

Was it worth it? 
Would you recommend it?
Do you think that with the wealth of info on the internet and also climbing with peers who are better than you that you could get similar results? 

Thanks
This sub... Is it just me, or is this sub just a place for moderately experienced climbers to throw their anecdotes around? It just seems like none of the folks giving advice have any degree of expertise, and are either repeating what they heard somewhere else or assuming that their personal experience is universally applicable. Folks can also be weirdly hostile on here when they encounter any info contrary to their held beliefs.

In other words, this is just a bioscience sub, and folks who want to climb harder/better should probably look elsewhere. 

Does anyone else feel this way? Is there a way we could improve this sub? Discuss, I guess
I'm always so pumped by the time I get to the crux at the end of this route. Would appreciate feedback on improving technique and movement efficiency, so that I'm not so desperate before the chains.
Shaking after climbing and bouldering and can't sleep - I'm desperate I've had this problem for more than a year now and it's ruining my joy for climbing and bouldering.

I got significantly stronger winter last year, but at the same time I started having sleep problems after a session - even if I stop at 5 or 6 pm. I don't know what to do and I'm starting to become desperate.

I've tried a ton of things, and mostly I've been eating more carbs, both during and after workout, but I can't seem to get it right. I'm shaking, my heart rate is up, my body just feels stressed, I'm extremely tired and at the same time won't be able to sleep, and tomorrow I will feel totally down and exhausted. Sometimes I'm up all night eating and drinking stuff and doing breathing exercises and stretches until I crash into sleep in the morning.

I just had a session where I consumed about 25 grams of dextrose, but I'm still shaking. Also had a good meal before and after. I'm drinking juice and eating honey too. Also getting a lot of protein.

What to do? Are any of you struggling with this as well?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you for all the answers, I really appreciate!! Editing to add:

\- I'm a 26 year old female, 170 cm and 60 kg (maybe too lean, as someone asked?)

\- I don't drink coffee or take any kind of caffeine in general

\- I've had my metabolism checked (result: normal) and talked to a doctor who just thought that I'm using my glycogen storage faster than the average person

\- This problem can happen to me at any time, even after weeks off from climbing, and even though I'm super well rested and not stressed about things in my life. First hard session and bam, I'm back, I can feel the shaking starting immediately when I get off the wall after trying hard on a problem, even if it's only at the beginning of a session
Climbing every other day, when to hangboard? I have finally (and pretty reluctantly) decided to do some hangboarding to get my fingers stronger. I climb (indoor or outdoor depending on the weather) 3/4 days a week, usually every other day, sometimes two days in a row. 

Climbing is my stress relief and my main mode of socialising so I am not willing to climb fewer days in order to do more training. I accept that it may mean progressing slower.

So when should I hangboard? On my day off or on my climbing day? If on my climbing day, at the beginning or at the end of the climbing session, or at another time entirely?



Edit:
A lot of the comments are asking: why do I want to start hangboarding?

I am very short (5ft exactly or 153cm) and often end up having to be very dynamic on holds and sequences that weren't designed for it (indoors) or having to use pretty bad intermediaries to get to the decent holds (outdoors). 

This has forced me to develop pretty good technique but I feel that I am held back by my strength (both fingers and general pulling strength). Additionally I cannot boulder (I suffered a very bad knee injury a few years ago and my surgeon has warned me against any impact) so I am looking for other ways to build that strength.
The BoulderBot App for home climbing walls and spray walls is now available for iOS Hello everybody!

Last year I posted a [couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/miitt8/i_trained_a_procedural_generation_model_to_create/) of [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/q6sy8e/i_released_the_pro_version_of_boulderbot_for/) announcing BoulderBot, a new Android App for procedurally generating new climbs on home climbing walls and spray walls. Since there was a lot of interest for an iOS version, I'm posting an update: the app is now finally available on the iOS App Store!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zct3c491eem81.png?width=4134&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f91766e5ddaa59e63b4bac6d0decfe70c2e61f20

The app works by requesting a picture of your wall, its dimensions, and the position/difficulty of the holds. After setting up the wall, you can use the procedural generation model to create new climbs, using parameters like difficulty and length to customize the problems.

If you would like to try the App out, it can be downloaded from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boulderbot/id1601111003) (iOS) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boulderbot.app.android&amp;utm_source=rdti) (Android)

&amp;#x200B;

Now that the iOS version is finally out, my next priority is adding functionality to share walls and problems with friends, and I also have a lot of improvements to the generation model and user interface in the pipeline.

Happy to answer any question or for any feedback!
Fear of commiting to riskier moves Title says it. I'm having a hard time dealing with this particular aspect. To be more specific, more dynamic movements to smaller holds. V7 with a very static crux, tiny holds, sounds great. Finish with big, but straightforward, deadpoint to a small pocket for the topo, and I fucking dry-fire a lot.  
  
I am fortunate enough to have no major injury history, probably due to this reluctantly of making this move type. But it's really holding me back. It seems like my body just "nopes" at the risk of shock-loading my fingers or being too explosive on the shoulders. Any tips?

**Edit! Thank you all for replying, you're all awesome. And in replying to you all it's become a bit more clear to me that pockets particularly scare me. My home gym does not use them (insurance liability) and I think the lower exposure to them really hasn't helped.
Using TryHard more often I find that when climbing with more skilled climbers I can perform better (try harder), also in front of crowds, however, when climbing with some usual partners I feel as though I lack the ability to try harder. (I know the answer, climb with more skilled partners, is in the question) but have any climbers stumbled across any tricks that they feel help with their ability to perform at a high level?
Any climbers out there who peaked in 40s or even 50s? I started a year ago at 32 and want some inspiration for how far I can push this :)
Climbing &amp; The Carnivore Diet I made a joke comment on a thread yesterday claiming that Dave Macleod was the strong climber that he is because of his experimenting with The Carnivore Diet, the comment got 12 down votes haha so clearly the general feeling is that this diet is BS?

But I’m genuinely curious as to whether anyone has tried this style of eating and how it affected their climbing performance?

Or tell me your thoughts why that comment got so many downvotes but no actual replies?
what drills/ routines do you do? Been bouldering 7 months now and want to add a bit more structure to my practice rather than "warm up and throw myself as walls for an hour and a bit"

What drills for fitness and technique do you do?
The most realistic indoor climbing for our door climbing? (In general) I’m a gym rat through and through but want to get outside eventually. What is the most realistic training to do indoors that will translate to outdoors.

What would you like to see in a survey of climbers? I'm a scientist by day, and am interested in undertaking a survey of climbers and seeing if there are any interesting correlations or deviations from the general population. What kinds of things do you think I should ask in the survey? Below is what I've thought of so far. I'll probably post this in a climbing subreddit, and release the results there too.

* Age
* Gender
* Country
* Preferred climbing discipline
* Time since starting climbing
* Grade
* Training/climbing sessions per week
* Diet (vegan/vegetarian/etc.)
* Any strength benchmarks?
* Any other demographic questions?

Naturally, a climbing subreddit will not be a perfectly representative sample of the actual average climber.
V10+ Climbers in this forum, how often and how long do you rest? First off, this is a boulder specific question because I find that (for me) timing the rest for sport climbing is much easier than bouldering. I've always benefitted from rest, but have found more and more that taking 5-7 days off - as often as every four weeks - is the only way I actualize any gains, regardless of whether I'm only climbing in the gym or outside. And if I'm incorporating minor training into that (max hangs, campusing, front levers, and/or dead lifts in some variation, 1-2x a week), I feel the need even more. And those first two or three climbing days back after that longer rest block, I almost always feel at my peak. I know a lot of people climb day on day off religiously, but I feel that I'm almost always in a training hole after doing that for as little as 2-3 weeks; by 4 or 5, I really need the rest. For background info, I climbed 13D as a sport climber within 4 years, then climbed on and off but not seriously for 6, then in the past 3 have really focused on strength and power and finally broke into double digit bouldering after years of pleateauing around V8-V9 (mostly due to lack of effort; the psych just wasn't there). What are other people's experiences? After reading the most recent interview with Katie Lamb, I'm starting to feel more and more convinced that when it comes to peak strength performance, less is more.
Stuffing that fear back down… deep down. I’m no stranger to heights. I’ve gone through firefighter training, requiring me to be “unsecured” to 40ft ladders with a charged hose and full gear on. That didn’t scare me too badly. When I first started climbing about 5 weeks ago, I had a little bit of fear, but it was quickly suppressed once I learned to trust my gear and partner. Now, I’m routinely climbing 5.9 to 5.10 and sometimes a 5.11. In the past couple of weeks, I’ve noticed when I’m climbing 5.10 and up, my fear drive kicks in because of the harder, less positive, technique heavy holds mixed with unsure footholds. Besides just climbing and getting time in on the wall, what are some tips and techniques for overcoming my fear again on these more difficult routes?
How do you train for big and or dynamic moves? So I’m 4’11 and I feel really strong! I could projects v6 v7 BUT give me a 4 with dynos or big move and I cannot make progress:( anyone know the best way to work on powerful moves? Being short at my gym sucks because the setters loves there big moves:( should I work on weighted pull ups or…..

How Do You Balance Training AND Hard Climbing? V6ish (depending on gym) climber. Climbing for 2 years.  6' Male, 162 Lb

Max 2 Rep pull up : 100 lbs. (160%. BW)


7 sec max hang : 65 lb. (149% BW)

Max 7 sec Pinch Block : 32 lb. (125% BW)


Im trying to come up with a pretty simple/consistent training plan but Im struggling to figure out how to train but also still be strong enough to climb strong and enjoyably too. This plan would incorporate 3-4 days a week of training or climbing. I feel like if I do a strength workout with light easy climbing I would need way more than 1 or 2 days of rest to climb at my absolute hardest and then more than 2 days to train hard again.... Am I overthinking this or should I not go to the gym no more than 3 times a week and give myself plenty of rest between hard training and climbing??   
  
orr should I just ignore training and just limit climb/perfect climbs 4ish times a week.
Does anyone have a pacemaker? How does it affect you?

Questions For Those Who Own A Personal Wall. I'm about to begin building a moonboard in my garage. My ceilings are the perfect height for the board to be at 40 degrees. I'm planning on attaching it to the wall at the base of the board and the ceiling joists at the top of the board (I believe this is referred to as "suspended"). I'm curious if anyone else here has done something similar and whether or not anyone knows if this is too much weight to put on the ceiling joists. I know the ceiling won't bear the full weight of the board since it also sits on the ground at the base, but I'm not an engineer so I don't know how to figure out how much weight is distributed where. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V31KSwkLAQ) is a video of someone building a moonboard similarly.
Fear of rope climbing I've been bouldering for around 2 years and got interested in rope climbing (top-rope, soon lead).   
I have a slight fear of heights but i got that managed by the first few sessions. Surpricingly!

In bouldering it's very "free" just me and the wall.  
The jump down, even from the top has never really botherd me, even tough the injury chance is significantly higher than with rope.   


In rope however my mind keeps jumping to what could go wrong, right from my knot not being tied properly to the rope breaking. I'm a freaking anxious mess up on the wall.   
The main problem for me isn't the danger of falling down into something, but the rope breaking/gear failure aka. the big fall.  
Normally i climb 50% of the route and either quit it, or speed climb to the top and pray that everything works, the experience is just so terrifying and leaves me in a depressed state for long after the session.  


From what i understand it's super rare that a climbing rope breaks, or that gear just "randomly" gives in. That logic just dosn't seem to be working for me up on the wall.  
I think the thing that scares the crap out of me, is that IF something goes wrong i will most likely be extremely injured or die..  


Any tips? 

Thanks!
Retrospective on my 5 years of climbing I have decided to take a look back on my (short) climbing career. The objective of this is to get a better idea of how to climb and train in the years to come. Feedbacks &amp; advices are welcome.

**General climbing stats**

33M, 163 lbs, 6’0. V6ish climber.

**Climbing history (5 years)**

When I started climbing, my initial goal was to get better at outdoor sport climbing. It turns out that I enjoy gym bouldering way more. My 5 years of experience can be summarized as so:

\- 3 years of mostly sport climbing (indoor &amp; outdoor)

\- 1 year of mostly hangboarding (covid)

\- 1 year of mostly gym bouldering

My current bouldering gym has about 10 problems per grade which allows me to get a good approximation of the sending probability:

\- V5: 95%

\- V6: 80%

\- V7: 20%

\- V8: only one send so far (I don’t try them often to be honest)

**Physical abilities**

\- 20 mm edge: 152% at 6s (semi-closed)

\- 1 RM pull up: 174%

\- Front lever: 10s-15s

(I was a fitness geek before I started climbing)

**Technical abilities**

My technical abilities (and not physical) are obviously what are holding back my climbing grade progress. Technique wise, I consider myself a well-rounded climber; I don’t have a specific weakness. As for the 20% remaining V6 that I can’t climb, I couldn’t find a particular style that describes these problems. The general gym opinion is that these problems are just harder V6. 

**Climbing-training strategies in the years to come**

I believe that I already mastered the basics of climbing technique. In a single session, I can send up to 8 different V6. What I need to work on are the small details of my climbing technique. Instead of climbing several V6 in a single session, I should probably pick one single V7 and focus on the small details that are making me fall.

I haven’t hangboarded in the last months and in the short-term, I don’t plan on doing so. However if I don’t see any progress in the V7 grade range, I will probably include some max hangs cycles.
Looking for ways to get better at endurance, starting from essentially zero Good morning,

I’m sure a lot of folks in here are trying to get better endurance this time of year since it’s warming up and outdoor climbing is back on the menu in a lot of places! I’m doing the same, but starting mainly at the point of zero. I have been progressing in both bouldering and weightlifting all winter and feel simultaneously stronger than ever when it comes to single-move ability, and weaker than ever when it comes to endurance.

For example. On a good day, I can make a serious run at a v8 Boulder and not make a fool of myself, while almost unilaterally getting pumped out of my gourd on any 5.10+/11- sport climb in the RRG. I see people here very often climb at a 12+\13- level at my bouldering level, and even though I can often do the moves on routes near that grade going bolt to bolt, they all feel way far away when it comes to a redpoint effort. I recently needed like 8 or 9 attempts over two days to send an 11b/c with a relatively good sitdown(ish) rest on it (magic bed at the RRG for reference).

The core issue seems to be the ability to hang on for a long time, and doing moderately challenging moves while tired. I essentially never send routes with hard finishes. Part of the issue is definitely my current build (6’4, 220+ lbs) but I’m not looking to lose a ton of weight since I need the muscle for stability. 

I’ve been thinking of doing 4x4s at my gym, which is where I climb normally (Midwest blues), and power endurance repeaters outlined in lattice’s training videos. I’ve never really done either before.

Are there any major things that I’m missing here to get better at this aspect of climbing? Surely my power will decrease while switching up the focus but I want to give myself a good shot at actually putting down some longtime goal routes at the motherlode this season! I know the common answer is to do more routes at RRG if I want to get better at that but I’m like 6 hours away so I can only  realistically get down there like 10-12 weekends of the year. Goal routes:Ale8, Hot for Teacher, Chainsaw, Tissue Tiger, Mercy
Would you guys climb at a gym that was only training boards? If there were a gym that had moon boards, kilter boards, tension boards, etc. only, would you be interested in climbing there if rates were lower than at a traditional climbing gym?

Edit: shoutout to u/Miles_Adamson for convincing me this was a bad idea, check his comment for why.
Double digit boulders, what % were you hanging when you climbed your first v10 This post is just out of general intrigue, but I’m wondering what BW % your max hang was when you climbed your first double digit boulder. I think it would be interesting data to collect.
i’m looking to open a new indoor bouldering-only gym, and i’m thinking of making my gym, circuits accessible to adaptive climbers. are there proper resources and any routesetting and gym design consideration i should be mindful of? [removed]
[Survey] Climbing experience and what training methods you use to improve (Undergraduate Research) I'm an undergraduate student in kinesiology doing course research on climbing performance and training modalities used to improve performance.  If you don't train outside of climbing, responses about your experience are still greatly appreciated and will be nice to compare to those that do use other training methods. 

[Survey Link](https://purdue.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0VfQij8tECQaGbA)

The survey is very short, around 1-2 minutes if you only climb and about 3-5 minutes if you do train outside of climbing. Thank you!
Update: trying to go from 7a (5.11d) to 8a (5.13b) in a year, just finished the mental skills phase A while back I posted that I'm trying to go from 7a to 8a in a single year. I divided the year into 3 phases: mental, tactical and physical. I just wrapped up the first phase and climbed my first 7b (5.12b) - very proud! I thought I’d post an update of my progress here, and of course I’d be very interested in getting some tips :)

[In this video I show the send of the 7b](https://youtu.be/fs8rqfDWao0), and explain why I’m doing this (long story short: my hips are badly damaged and I may need to quit bouldering, so I’m on this adventure as the ultimate way to force myself to enjoy sport climbing - and so far it’s working haha).

I started on January 1st. At that time I could send most 7a/v6 boulders at my gym and the ones I tried in Albarracin, but I couldn’t red point 6c (5.11a) in the gym or outdoors. This was partially due to endurance and tactics, but mostly due to fear of falling (which turned out to be mostly a fear of losing control).

So, after putting in about 20 hours of dedicated mental training (to overcome the fear of falling as well as learn how to climb relaxed), I managed to send my first outdoor 7b.  
Working on the mental part made a huge difference, not just in terms of climbing grade - I also enjoy sport climbing so much more now!

Some other stuff I noticed: I managed to send a technical 7a a week after the 7b. I was using this route as a way to practise tactics. I noticed it had a juggy pocket that I couldn’t use as a rest the first 2 times I tried it. But I kept looking for different positions and experimented with breathing and then suddenly the 3rd time I was going bolt to bolt I managed to relax and get energy back! After this I gave it 1 red point attempt and immediately sent it. Being able to relax and get energy back was a game changer, and I have no doubt this was 90% mental.

In the next phase I will focus on tactics and strategy. I spent 1 weekend practising this in a 7a and 7c route and I feel like I already learned a massive amount. I have no doubt I’ll be able to red point the 7c after I improve my tactics and strategy.

I also notice I’m having a LOT of fun now that my mindset is to learn rather than to send. I can be in any route and just enjoy the process. In the 7a, I decided to try a red point attempt because I felt I had learned most of what I could learn from that route. If I wouldn’t have sent it, it would have been OK and I would’ve started working the next route. After all, my goal this year is the 8a - everything else is a learning experience to get me there :)

By the way, I always try to quantify things. I did the Eric Hörst self assessment in December and again after the mental phase. Huge difference! It just goes to show even something as hard to pin down as mental skills are totally trainable.

Take. Rests. Please. This is just a friendly reminder post, that I know some people here need to read. Learn to actually rest and recover. Take a de-load week once a month, and stop bullshitting yourself and not actually resting. A de-load week should actually be treated like one. So many people are at the gym every day, or take "rest" days that consist of going and working out anyways. Let. Your. Body. Rest.  
  
We're all here because we love to climb and want to be better, but I know you folk have a hard time pressing on the brakes, I do myself. You're not getting any stronger by being at the gym every day, and taking rest days is not robbing you of valuable climbing time. Overtraining is just putting you at injury risk that will actually make you loss valuable climbing time and strength. No amount of increasing training volume is going to overcome the value of proper rest.
Moonboard Fiends/Friends, How Did Going Through the Benchmarks Translate to Climbing Off the Board? I’ve been climbing for a few years now. A few times a year I’d mess around on the Moonboard at my gym. Thought it was fun to do once in awhile but mostly boring. Recently, however, I’ve gotten into it. My gym switched from the 2017 set to the 2016 set and for some reason it’s been way more exciting and appealing to me. I’ve found myself looking forward to going to the gym to crank through some more benchmarks (something about ticking off another problem is just so satisfying, ya know?). 

As someone who values improving my climbing and lurks this sub, I know there are plenty of people here who can attest to the effectiveness of the Moonboard/other systems boards as a training tool. Those of you that have gone through/started going through the Moonbodd benchmarks, what improvements, and at what pace, have you noticed from your training on the MB? And how have those translated to climbing both on and off the board? I’d like to pick your brains about your experience—Tension and Kilter boarders please feel free to share—I wrote a few questions below, but as more of a loose guideline to get you thinking and share your experience.

a) what areas of your climbing do you feel most improved due to MB training? Contact strength, body position while climbing, endurance, mental game, etc.

b) what did progress look like for you personally ON the MB? When did you notice the problems on the next benchmark up starting to become more attainable? When did problems of a certain grade start to take less sessions/attempts to complete? How fast were you able to progress through different grades on the benchmarks?

c) when did you start noticing improvement off the board? Whether in the gym or outdoors—and were there specific styles that improved or ones that didn’t? To what degree did you see improvement—grade wise or using some other more fluid metric?

I recognize that everyone’s input and experience is going to be wildly different! Everyone who uses a board climbs at different grades and will have a different experience to share, which I think is great and there’s bound to be someone out there who would find it useful. It’d probably be helpful to others to share where you’re coming from if it’s relevant to what you’re writing. Thank you for taking the time to share, I’m excited to  get boarding!

PS—go ahead and drop your favorite benchmarks, too, regardless of grade!
Hangboard finger pressure and location? There's plenty of content on when to hangboard, grip, shoulder positions, etc but not alot on how your fingers actually sit on the edge.

I have a non standard 20mm edge and something I keep noticing is that whenever I hang I end up actually hanging at the very edge at about my first pip joint and the actual tips of my fingers don't exert a lot of pressure .

Another point is that I get a better hang from going pinky first. As in I try to push my pinky finger towards the back of the edge and try to think about pulling more with it. This is all half crimp btw.

Just curious what others think or if there's a consensus on the finger positions.
How do I know if my shoulders are "weak" or not? Are there good exercises to test this? Are there good exercises to test this? I don't really train my shoulders other than supplemental exercises like pullups, lat raises, and push ups. I don't often feel that my shoulders are weak, but I do sometimes struggle with high gastons around my max. Is this a kind of thing where if I don't notice a weakness I don't need to focus too much extra attention on it?

I'm mostly thinking about this because a current sport project has a high gaston as the crux move and while I have started sticking it consistently, my lower shoulder and deltoid are very sore on the arm I was doing the move with.
Hamstrings always really tight I'll do stretches on rest days and after I've climbed, and my hamstrings are always feeling very tight (kind of sore) whenever I do them, even if I've not really heel hooked. Do I just need to stretch them more? Any advice on this?
Long limbed climbers: what style suits us? As a climber with long arms (+12cm/5inches ape index) and legs, I’ve just finished a long term project which was completely my anti-style: a wide compression boulder revolving around a tight and uncomfortable heel hook.

Now I’m done I’m wondering what types of climbs/boulders actually suit those of us with long limbs? Is it generally more vertical, reachy/crimpy climbs?
Moonboarding So I just started moonboarding this last week after climbing for approximately 2 years. I’ve mostly been doing indoors bouldering and outdoor lead/toproping, but for some reason the moonboarding just really spoke to me. I want to do it as much as possible!
However, I felt like going today after going properly for the first time two days ago was a mistake as my tendons and back muscles are not happy with my impatience (tried it once some months ago, but not ‘properly’, I was so tired I could barely establish after bouldering beforehand).
I guess I’m asking if anyone has any suggestions for how often it would be safe to try hard at the moonboarding a week to start with?
Do you fall on trad gear? How to push your limits while still being safe? I've done around 40-50 trad leads by now ( mostly 5.7s in JTree Yosemite Red Rock). I don't recall falling other than one time. I have hung on my gear 5 times or so. On the one hand I'm not trying to test my placements. But am I limiting myself mentally by not knowing what works and what doesn't? How do you do this while being safe? E.g fall on trad gear while having a top rope back up?
10-20min stretching routine to improve lower body flexibility My mobility in my legs and my hips has been seriously lacking and I feel like it's been hindering my climbing
Looking for recommendations or a resource for a stretching routine I can do everyday preferably before bed that will help me gain flexibility. So if you have a stretch or series of stretches that you recommend Borna resources that has helped you it would be much appreciated
Should I always look for the setter’s intended beta or should I look for the best beta for my height and strengths to improve? 6’4, similar reach, 180lb, climbing since October, 4-5 days a week for the last 3 months. My max grade is lower V5 at every gym I’ve been to. 

I realize that problems are set for an average height person and that I have a much longer reach than others. I skip holds on the majority of the harder problems I’m able to send and it almost feels like cheating to me? I feel like I should care a lot more about developing general technique at this stage than I do about pushing grade.

I get that it’s good to play to your strengths but I’m typically avoiding the avoidable cramped moves that I feel are limiting to me. Should I just keep projecting V5s or should I slow down and try to ‘properly’ climb V4s the way a slightly shorter person would?
I'm 20lbs overweight and increasing. Please help :O Hi all,

This isn't easy to make this post. Frankly, it's embarrassing. I'm turning to /r/climbharder because, aside from working on my video game project to pay the bills, climbing is the biggest hobby in my life.

Besides my poor self-body image, climbing is the area where I am most affected by my weight.

I understand it is a simple game of calories-in, calories-out. I think the issue is my mental fortitude.

I am the kind of person where it was an Olympian struggle just to get brushing my teeth at night into my routine. I'm a *lazy piece of shit*, as some may say.

If you were once like me and managed to mentally finesse yourself into being shedding those pounds, I would be so grateful to hear your story.

Cheers

\*edit\* I haven't responded to all of the comments yet, but I want to thank you all. The suggestions here are some of the best I've ever seen on reddit. Thanks, /r/climbharder.
Training on smaller edges VS adding more weight advice. I try to do a couple of sets of max hangs once per week, mostly because that's part of my team's workout, partly because doing it with some slight progressive overload keeps my fingers happy, and partly just to improve strength slowly. I've done most of my hangboarding on a regular 20mm lattice rung.  I'm thinking of switching to 10mm crimps my gym installed pretty recently. I feel more than strong enough on 20mm ish edges climbing and struggle a bit more with 10mm and smaller crimps-particularly where a high half-crimp or full-crimp is necessary. I noticed today after trying the 10mm that I was pretty much forced to use a more crimped grip. Not full-crimping but definitely more crimped than on a 20mm, where I notice sometimes I'm kinda between a half crimp and "chisel crimp".  I'm thinking this might be beneficial, my index definitely is a weak link in half crimps.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone who has switched from 20mm to 10mm or even less, around what %bw on 20mm do you think is good to switch at? How long did you stay on smaller edges, do you feel it was more injury-prone than more weight on a 20mm? Overall what was your experience?
What are your best climbing/training “Hot Takes” that you have ? Edit- My “Hot Take” is that Finger Strength is the most important aspect of your climbing performance and if you were to train consistently you will push grades. Proper finger Strength allows you to Focus on technique

Edit- I have just created a new sub to solely discuss finger Strength and power if you have any questions,ideas or just wanna share your story please input! https://www.reddit.com/r/FingerStrength/
Moonboard as a hangboard: my experience gaining finger strength I've been climbing for roughly three years now, and in that time I've never done any properly regimented hangboarding. I've tried it, but I could never commit to it. I just found it too boring! 

My current finger strength metrics are: 

(I weigh 65kg - 179cm)

~+50kg on lattice 20mm rung (possibly more, tested Dec. 2021) 
5 sec one arm hang on beastmaker 14mm edge 

I climb on the moonboard pretty much once a week at the moment. My sessions on the 2016 setup currently look like this: 

3-5 V5s (working my way through them), then max effort climbing from there. I either project some V8-9s, or I try to flash/second go any V7s that catch my eye.  

Clearly not the most targeted approach, but working through the V4-5s is tough work, and I'm down to the last 20 V5s, which... Definitely don't feel V5! 

Now, as for finger strength. As everyone knows, there are some ridiculously tiny holds on the moonboard, and some of them get used even on lower grade problems. I found that by just working through grades on the board, you will see some serious finger strength gains. The most important part of all of this is really actually trying hard, and being very warmed up in order to pull hard. 

Properly attempting to flash everything I try on the board really forces you to knuckle down and crimp and pull HARD. Through just doing this once or (at the most) twice a week, I've seen very positive results. The 2016 setup especially seems to lend itself to finger strength gains, as there's only a handful of jugs, and the rest of the holds are pretty small compared to anything you'll find in a commercial gym, or even compared to the 2017 or the 2019. 

(quick caveat - please please don't get on the board if you have a finger injury, or you don't feel ready to climb on the moonboard, it can be very strenuous)

Now, I don't think of the moonboard as a replacement for a hangboard, and I don't go into a session focusing on gaining finger strength, it's more of a bi-product of what I would already be doing. I don't think focusing on finger strength would change TOO much about potential gains, and mainly - it would be boring, the very thing I'm looking to avoid.

You could say I'm not disciplined for not committing to a hangboard and being worried about being bored and I'd probably agree to an extent, but I'm very disciplined about how I approach moonboarding. I always ensure I get through the 3-5 V5s a session, and I haven't gone more than two weeks without moonboarding - or board climbing of some sort - since August 2019 (lockdowns not permitting). 

Obviously I'm discussing the moonboard here, but if you have another system board or a spray wall with some gnarly old-school crimps and a good community of people who set regularly on that wall, jump on that too! This has just been my experience. 

While I know the hangboard is certainly the most specific and targeted training one can do for finger strength, it seems the moonboard can be used to train fingers too. 

This is not a post to tell anyone to not hangboard, or to say moonboarding is going to be better than hangboarding, but it's for those people who just can't stand the idea of hanging off a bit of wood for a few seconds over and over again, and want to see if there's another way, even it's perhaps not 100% optimal. It's also just my experience, your results may vary.  

Just as Jerry Moffat says about training, "you've got to enjoy it." And I bloody love moonboarding.
Fellow short climbers: let's discuss mentality Hi all, I'm a short climber, and I'd like to have a discussion about mentality.

I'm male, 157 cm (5'2), 53 kg (117 lbs). Indoor bouldering/leading 2.5 years at around V5/V6 and AUS 21 (5.10d/5.11a depending on which conversion chart you use).

I am surrounded by taller climbers who can do things in ways that I cannot. That's normal, we all have different bodies, skills, strengths, weaknesses, etc. The question for me is about the best mentality when it comes to accepting and working with the implications of being a short climber.

For example, I'll encounter a move where everyone else can reach the hold static or by deadpointing while keeping tension on one foot. Meanwhile for me to reach the hold I'll have to cut feet, but I can't hang on. I'll have to cut feet because either of two cases: (1) I am physically not long enough to keep my foot in any contact at all while reaching for the hold; or (2) I feel I just can't keep enough body tension to keep my foot on.

In both cases, I will try all different ways to make the move better, adjust body position for the catch, etc. But eventually I'll get to a point where I feel in my current state of skill, coordination and strength I am not capable of sticking the move. 

In case (1), it's "if I can just get stronger then I'll be able to hang on despite cutting feet -- but in my current state I'm not able to do it". In case (2), it's "I'm so extended that I have to compensate with more/better body tension -- but in my current state I'm not able to do it". In both cases, I give up on sticking the moves my taller friends can stick, and I feel like I just need to train more (and smarter) than they do.

Now the question I'd like to discuss is this. Is this a productive or counterproductive mindset? 

On the one hand, I feel like I'm making excuses and being mentally weak when I give up on moves that everyone else seems to be sticking. I feel I should be trying harder, or be willing to experiment more with different beta, body positioning, etc. I feel the belief that I'm not strong/skilled enough is self-limiting. It can prevent me from trying hard enough, prevent me from fully committing to the move and prevent me from having the necessary curiosity to really explore how I can use my body to execute the move.

On the other hand, I also feel like this mindset helps me accept what's out of my control (my height) and motivates me to work on what I can control, by doing targeted training to compensate for my lack of height. It's a fact I'm short, it's a fact that being short imposes certain disadvantages (as well as certain advantages, of course), it's a fact that some of these disadvantages can be mitigated by training lock off strength, finger/contact strength, dynamism/power, coordination, body tension, etc.

I am always internally conflicted about what mentality is going to be helpful for me. Fellow short climbers, how do you navigate these issues? And what's your experience with grappling with the implications of your height?
Preventing spin on one arm hangs? Any advice on training yourself not to spin off holds when doing one arm hangs? I can hold myself steady for 5 seconds if I’m hanging on a bar or jug where I can use outward pull to control the spin, and I can hold a bodyweight half crimp for 5 seconds on a big crimp with my body rotating quite a bit. If I move to a smaller crimp I spin off before 5 seconds. I’ve been starting the hangs with my chest perpendicular to the hangboard
How much can you progress in multiple years of consistent training? Question about long term goal setting. Hello people, 

All the training books I‘ve read say that it is important to set long and short term SMART Goals (goals that are specific, measurable and ambitious but still realistic and with a date/time for when it should be reached). 
So I now wonder how to set longterm goals? It feels like an impossible task for me to estimate what is realistic progress within a year or more. How much progress can one expect to make with multiple years of consistent training?

Of those here who have been training consistently for multiple years, how was your progress over time? Did you set yourself longterm goals over multiple years? Did they help you stay focused on training?  

I am mostly interested in the general approach to goal setting and how you apply it to your own training.
What is the best non-climbing thing that has boosted your climbing gains? I think about climbing 24/7 and I am getting better all the time, but I want to be sure I am approaching my improvement on all levels. So on that note, does anyone have any unexpected or surprising non-climbing climbing hacks that have helped them get gains or keep the stoke?
verdict on collagen/gelatin supplements? tendon elasticity gains? I have been following Baar's work closely and have implemented many of his recommendations into my climbing training and weightlifting. I'll be damned if I haven't noticed some benefits to adapting my training to increase tendon elasticity! But anyway, the point of this thread is to get your thoughts on collagen/gelatin supplementation. Baar is an advocate of using it 30-60 minutes before training focusing on tendon remodeling. I've always been of the mind that "just eat a high protein diet and you'll have enough building blocks for everything you need" but it almost always pays off to stop and really listen to people smarter than you ie if Keith Baar is contradicting my beliefs then I may want to change my beliefs or at least try to think it through! He calls glycine which gelatin and collagen are very high in, a "conditionally essential amino acid" once a training stimulus has been applied. For a few hours the amino acid is "essential" for the proper repair to be done to the tendons.

First off, there is no difference according to Baar in regards to gelatin or collagen. Either can be used. The collagen that is marketed to us as climbers is hyped overpriced stuff. You can buy bulk gelatin or bulk collagen for MUCH cheaper than the companies that target climbers sell you a bag.

OK, to compare real quick the glycine content - which according to Baar is the key component for tendon rebuilding - 

100g of turkey or about a quarter pound = 1.15g of glycine

100g of gelatin = 27g of glycine!

Now obviously nobody is eating 100g of gelatin but 1-2 tablespoons of gelatin will provide 3-5g of glycine along with high levels of proline and valine, also important for our tendons. This is much easier to consume pre-training than THREE QUARTER POUND OF TURKEY, not that turkey isn't delicious, it just might affect your training to have that much meat sitting in your stomach, also gelatin is more economical and easier to replicate especially if you are on an every 6 hour tendon remodeling program. You could make high protein gelatin snacks out of fruit juice+gelatin and munch a few a half hour or so before training. Gelatin lacks other essential amino acids so it would be important to have some other type of protein for instance 1 scoop of whey isolate or pea protein or something similar, along with the gelatin.

What's your opinion? Is collagen/gelatin going to help us as climbers? I'm really into not trying to dogmatically stick to any beliefs especially when very intelligent people are backing opposing views....but I also want to hear from others here. WHAT DO YOU THINK!?!? :)
Numerically quantifying hangboard for a better understanding of when and why hangboard may be useful for hand strength long term I've been meaning write [this comment into a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/tc04in/steve_maisch_strength_cycle_where_is_the_limit/i0cz1fa/) so here it is.

----------------

**Determining volume of climbing versus hangboard for long term persistent adaptations**

For persistent long term gains in hand strength one needs to take into account any type of hangboard or campus board work in conjunction with the amount of volume and intensity of climbing. Theoretically one can "just climb" and get to elite hand strength like Sharma, Graham, and others who pretty much never trained. One can also use only max hangs and climbing, but you can also use repeaters and climbing and so on.

That's the hard nature of things because taking into account the combined stimulus is more difficult to do due to the variation in grip types and variance of climbs one does in a session and various sessions.

The easiest way to track things could be something like only analyzing crimp climbs. Theoretically, let's use these hypothetical examples of comparable volume on the hands that may elicit similar strength stimulus:

* 10-15 crimp climbs in a session 
* 3-5 sets of max hangs + 7-12 crimp climbs 
* 3-5 sets of repeaters + 7-10 crimp climbs

Obviously, there may be some variability, but the cumulative stress on the hands is of approximate similar volume and intensity to improve. Max hangs tend to be more stressful because of the higher weight, but repeaters tend to have much more time under tension so they represent a much bigger overall stressor cumulatively. With each of these you'd obviously be working on harder crimp climbs, max hangs, and repeaters over time as well to elicit the hand strength improvements. Thus, this is probably the simplest way to intuitively understand the volume of "only climbing" or "climbing and hangboard" needed to progress.

This also answers the question of why for beginners it's better to ***just climb*** in most cases than doing a combination of climbing + hangboard. A beginner will have technique deficits such that doing 10-15 crimp climbs focusing on technique would be better than doing say 3 repeaters + 7-10 crimp climbs by getting in 3-5+ extra climbs working with technique. That adds up over the course of a year where someone is getting an extra [3-5 climbs per session * 3x a week * 50 weeks in a year = 3-5 * 3 * 50] = 450-750 extra climbs in a year to work on technique. You'd see huge technique differences in someone just climbing versus someone who would be doing climbing + hangboard from the get go. 

----------------

**Complexity because of various grip types and climb styles**

The above example does not take into account the variation in grip types, climbing styles, and so on and it gets a little harder to start doing that. 

You cannot train everything at once lest you get overuse injuries. For instance, if you were trying to train say half crimp, open hand, pockets, slopers, and such on hangboard to improve at all these different types of grips you'd barely have any volume to be on the climbing wall or outside much at all to learn the nuances of climbing technique. This is generally where the understanding that training half crimp provides the most carryover to full crimp and open hand. You get the most benefit for minimizing the amount of grip time you spend on hangboard to maximize your climbing volume.

Also, to answer the max hangs versus repeaters debate the main conclusion I've come to personally is that repeaters represent a more consistent amount of hand strength work when combined with enough volume and intensity on the wall probably lead to the most consistent improvements. However, that is mainly because it's a bigger stimulus of volume and time under tension than max hangs. One can absolutely get max hangs + climbing to work consistently or only climbing to the level where it's a good stimulus to improve hand strength long term... But these things tend to be more intuitive to some climbers than others even with tracking everything you're doing. 

The repeaters make things a bit simpler giving a bigger hand strength stimulus which combined with climbing seem to offer the most consistent returns in the long run from my experience using them and recommending them. However, the downside is obviously that repeaters also require much more time under tension, so it can take away from volume spent on climbing compared to just climbing or climbing + max hangs. 

The reason why board climbing like moon, tension, and such seem to provide steady improvement is that it forces someone to consistently try hard with their grips which can consistently improve hand strength. Moon board in particular seems to force hard crimping hand movements and cutting feet which makes you strong at those movements. Unlike the normal commerical gym setting where half a set can be mostly parkour moves and such, you're getting regular tough climbing moves on the body and hands to force adaptation long term. However, in many cases board climbing forces a specific style and perhaps a particular angle if your board can't incline or decline, so it's indeed limited in some regard too.

----------------

**Find something that works for you**

And this is why the answer is it depends. Whatever helps you get the most consistent stress on your hands to progressive overload safely long term. Can be any variation of the modalities and it can vary as you get stronger too.

* Just climbing
* Climb + max hangs
* Climb + repeaters

The key is to make sure you're improving at your climbing and not just improving at your hand strength. One can absolutely prioritize hand strength like this and get way too strong hands for the grade, so there must be a balance if you're using the latter two to make sure the climbing + hangboard is translating to the wall as well. 

Sometimes it can ebb and flow in cycles. Sometimes it is effective to spend 90-100% of the time on the wall if your hands are too strong for the grade, but if they were too weak for the grade maybe 70-80% time on the wall and getting in some specific hand strength may be more effective.
Nerve Glides, Climber’s Elbow, and Shoulder Pain This is just some info I wish I had earlier this season because it likely would have saved me a lot of pain and kept me feeling stronger all season. I am not a doctor or medical professional.

Tl;dr: If you’ve never heard of nerve glides, and you have (or rather, think you have), Climber’s Eblow (Medial Epicondylitis) or shoulder pain that doesn’t seem to fit any common injuries, then you should really give them a shot. My understanding is that risk is pretty low, and reward can be very high (potentially complete pain reduction in just a few sessions). See links below for the exercises in question.

This season I thought I had classic climber’s elbow because of where the pain manifested. My (incorrect) understanding was that if pain is on the inside of your, it’s pretty much always climber’s elbow. I reduced intensity somewhat, started rehab (based on u/eshlow ‘s article Overcoming Tendonitis), and actually saw some improvement initially, so diagnosis confirmed in my mind. But after a few weeks, despite limited volume/intensity and following the protocol pretty well, my progress stagnated. I gave it a while, but essentially my pain wasn’t improving for a long enough time that I started looking elsewhere. Enter nerve glides. I actually had done these before several years ago when recommended by a PT in a casual setting, but I had completely forgotten about them recently. I started doing them again 2 weeks ago, and my pain has dramatically reduced. These have also reduced some shoulder “weirdness” that I’ve actually posted about on here previously

The exercises are simple, I’ve linked a few below. Another term to search for is Cubital Tunnel Syndrome (same general idea as carpal tunnel syndrome, but in your elbow). A lot of the risk factors aren’t actually climbing related. I’m pretty sure my issues were exacerbated by my sleeping positions, sitting at a desk all day (leaning on the affected arm), and the way I hold my phone, lol.

Some of the videos are more clear about this than others, but you CAN overdo these exercises, and aggravate the nerve further. An important thing to consider is that this isn’t a muscle or tendon issue, and it shouldn’t be treated as such. Generally, don’t do more than 3 sets of 5 reps a day. Also, my understanding is that any active “stretching” of the nerve should be avoided initially, as this is a bit more risky, but it does serve as a progression if pain isn’t improving. In the case of this progression, the “stretching” feeling shouldn’t be held for more than 3-5 seconds for only 5-10 reps a day. I personally have had luck by doing glides for all three of the nerves that go through the elbow: ulnar, medial, and radial.

How often do you fall while clipping? What are your tactics to avoid dangerous falls mid clip, and how do you manage fear in these circumstances? Title pretty much says it all.

I took one big fall on a crux clip, and although the catch was good, I injured some pulleys trying (and failing) to catch myself grabbing the quickdraw. Now my head game around clipping is absolute crap.

I've worked somewhat on practicing clip drops, but progress is slow because the fact remains that not all clips are safe to blow.

Also curious how often people fall while clipping....I never see it in comps, or videos of Ondra/Stefano, etc. How often does it happen to the crushers and up-and-comers of r/climbharder? Trying to gauge how much I've inflated the risk in my head.
Anxiety around outdoor trips (not performance related) This is a bit of a long wall of text rant mixed with a request for help.

I'm Sam, 37, started climbing at the end of 2015 2 years fter moving to the UK, got obsessed, started training eating better made new friends etc etc, you know the whole lot of good and not so goods. Also been a heavy pot smoker for the most part of the past 15 years, now quit and happy(well, happier).


I also have an addictive personality, struggle with anxiety and self deprecating thoughts. And this is where things start to get annoying.
 Till 2019 I had a partner that would help my hype, was always up for a weekend trip, always on the lead or bouldering, had yearly trips to Spain. Last year I bought a micro van, converted it. All good right? Not really. I am anxious when it comes to go out, drive, even if locally, engage in behaviours that would make me come up with excuses to not go (eg: planned a solo trip to the Peak District to try my project boulder, had 3 days / nights... couldnt sleep the might before leaving, woke up ordered kebabs from 3 different takeaways, ate all of them felt like crap and postponed my departure by 1.5 days. I still went 2 days after, sent the project, had a blast,came back.)
Anxiety kicks in, all the times. Anxious about what no idea. Id have thought quitting weed and booze for good would have helped, had no withdrawals, fell back into focussed determined mode, but now this missing piece I used to love (and still do when Im out there) is messing with me.

Is there anybody else that has experiences like this? How did you overcome them? Anything I could resort to (im already seeking therapeutic help, so am looking for extras really... articles books etc...) to to quiet my anxiety and allow myself my  beloved rocks to come back intoy life?

thanks, and apologies if it doesnt make much sense

First edit: THANK YOU ALL for the interest and responses!!! You're a bunch of kind hearted people and I'm smiling a bit more seeing the boat I'm in has other people (and also I'm sorry we're all feeling like this really).
Sharing some pictures of my app that enables climbers to build, follow and share custom training sessions and log climbing
Anyone else have pretty much constant finger injuries? I've been climbing pretty regularly since 2013, but as soon as I started to reach into the 12's 2 years ago and project harder routes for me, I've been experiencing lots of finger injuries. I haven't had anything serious, but experience pain in different parts of my fingers. At one point last year, I had 3 finger injuries at once. Physiologically, my fingers seem to have adapted to the climbing specific stresses. I remember having a finger ultrasound a few years ago where the sports med doc said I have the trademark thickening of the flexor tendons often found in climbers.

I also trained myself a while back to use pretty much exclusively open-hand and half-crimp grips, even on small holds. I can't remember the last time I full-crimped anything.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? What did you do to solve the problem? I'm tired of reaching a new high and then getting injured only to go back to climbing 5.10.
How do you prep the body to start climbing again? I’ve been quite unfit for a good few months So I’m looking to see if there are any exercises to warm up and prepare to go back to the climbing gym? When I say unfit I mean extremely stationary not leaving the house or going for walks for a very long period
My local gym is putting on a climbing comp, how should I train? My local gym is putting on a climbing competition, and I signed up for the V4-6 section because that’s what I climb at.

That being said, I’d really like to perform well and feel like I gave it my all. What resources can I check out to learn about training? My gym does have two hangboards and a tension board. 

Thanks

Edit:
Thanks for all the replies! Here is a link to the comp I’m talking about https://valleyrockgym.com
It takes me a long while to hit my peak athletic ability during my sesh Like I'll do my warm up for about 20 mins and I won't be at my peak until like an hour into my sesh. Once I'm warm though, I can do the gym boulders that I would be having trouble with at start of my sesh no problem... Anyone got any tips for getting warmed up faster? Would like to be able to get to my projects faster
Setters, how do you manage work and training? I recently became a route setter at my local gym, and have noticed that I become very fatigued afterwards (even without trying hard moves), and basically need a rest day to climb at a reasonable level again. 
Do you get used to the light volume, or did you tone down the training volume/intensity to accommodate?
Gaining strength while cutting weight? How much strength should someone be able to gain while cutting weight slowly(0.5 - 1lb/wk)?

In my case right now I'm male 5'9 150lb. Hang on 18mm is relatively weak at about 10s bodyweight, pull up is about 1.45x bodyweight. I'm thinking of dropping to closer to 140lb(I still have plenty of fat to lose no ed issues), is it realistic to gain strength over the 2-4months it will take?
How to get better at reading boulder problems Anyone have suggestions for how to improve at reading indoor boulder problems? I struggle to find the right solution from the ground and tend to improvise on the wall, which works for slab but on a physical roof boulder it’s not very efficient. 

I’d like to know so I can flash more climbs and improve my comp climbing.
Update: trying to go from 7a (5.11d) to 8a (5.13b) in a year, just finished the tactical phase Time for the second update of my road from 7a to 8a in a single year. I started on this journey in January because of some hip issues, which meant I may have to quit bouldering (which I really enjoy, but I can still do sport climbing as it's less hard on the body). In the first 2 months this year, I was focussing on mental skills, which allowed me to climb my first 7b ([see previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/tokvp4/update_trying_to_go_from_7a_511d_to_8a_513b_in_a/)). Now, I was focussing on tactics, [and sent my first 7c!](https://youtu.be/Vvs-CTxxA4M)

The video shows the send as well as the tactics I used on that climb. It's probably nothing new for experienced sport climbers, but because I'm mostly a boulderer it was very important that I dedicated a few weeks to practise tactics and strategy as the make a massive difference!

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I’ve practised other things on different routes. I’ve experimented with shaking tactics and how long to rest, as well as climbing speed. Now I’m starting to understand when to climb fast, and when to climb precise, and how much time to take to shake (or to skip rests and shake while climbing). It’s very useful stuff to experiment with!

I’m very happy I’ve dedicated time to work on mental and tactical skills, as it has made sport climbing significantly more enjoyable for me. From now on I will build my pyramid and choose an 8a. I will also have a double hip surgery, and the expected recovery time is at least 4 months...  which means lots of hangboarding. So I get to focus on getting strong for the first time! :p

As always, advice is very welcome. In any case, I’m really psyched with the progress! I'm really enjoying the process and it's just amazing how climbing allows for so many different ways to improve at the sport.
More constant "weak" days Recently I've noticed that a lot of my climbing sessions are not up to the standard of performance that I like to get out of myself. I climb three times a week (Tues/Thurs/Sun) and have observed that Sundays tend to be my weakest days, Tuesdays are the strongest, and Thursdays are either really good or really bad. My diet does not change very much and I try to get proper rest, sometimes doing cardio on 1-2 of the off days. Same warmup everytime I go to the gym which takes about 30-45 mins. I've been climbing for nearly 1.5 years. I'm wondering if this could be a mentality thing, just not forcing myself to try-hard enough?

Edit: deload week time
Recommendations on climbing training books? Looking for a book that can tell me about some training programs, mainly focusing on muscle growth and injury prevention. Any recommendations?
Any training exercises you'd recommend to get more comfortable heel hooking Lately, I've noticed on slightly overhanging problems, I'm not generating any tension with my heel hooks. I recently (couple months) started focusing more on my lower body workouts (specifically hamstrings) so that I can start generating more power through my heel but I'm not seeing any progress. 

Aside from just doing more problems that have heel hooks (hard to find regularly within my grade range), do you have any climbing exercises/routines you recommend to improve on this?

Thanks

Get into battlemode Heyo,

probably a strange question but i really have troubles going into "battlemode". I only boulder, but should nt matter i guess.

The thing is, when i climb a new problem, it takes me - if it is anywhere near my limit, a lot of tries/sessions to give a good burn. Mostly because i try to figure out a efficient beta that "feels nice". Not a bad thing i guess, but sometimes you just have to crank through without it feeling nice but just super awkward and hard.  

I think i really lack progression because of that. I can do climbs effortlessly when there is the possibility to do so, but as soon as i need to force something out of my body, strength wise, i need a lot of sessions just to figure that out.

How should i "overcome" this? Somehow i wired by brain to think of "giving hard burns" is ruining my skin faster (which is my #1 limiting factor), but probably it is the opposite...
"Climbing centric" plan to crush my bouldering projects, need your input Hey folks ! I have put together the first ever training plan for myself, since going outdoor all the time is not an option any more. Although I have a reason to back my plan, I'm not sure if everything would make sense. So I would love to get some input from you folks here. I'm really keen to learning from your advice, and refine my plan to best serve my goal. Thank you in advance.

**My info**:

* male, 61kg, 171cm (5ft 7”)
* climbing age: 4.5 years (95% outdoor), training age: 2 months (on and off) over the cost of my climbing
* my outdoor boulders pyramid:  1xV9, 4xV8, 7xV7, 3xV6, and a tons of V5 and below
* strength assessment: 1 arm hang on 20mm edge with 12KG supported, 1 rep of one arm chin up on the left side, and 3/4 rep on the right side

**My goals for 2022**:

I have 3 climbs, 1xV8, 1xV9 and 1xV10 that I would love to finish by the end of this year. They all expose my weakness in the different ways, and after having quite a few sessions on each of them. I have broken them down into the qualities that I will need to improve in order to have the best chance at each of them.

* Ability to do a better high foot step
* Ability to do a hard rock over, particularly with a heel without wrecking my MCL
* Improving a pinch and pocket strength, particularly on a steep terrain
* Ability to latch a sloper from a big move
* Ability to generate force from 3 point of contacts (1 leg), and generate force from sloper
* Tiny bit of juice to finish the longer boulders, the V8 one in particular

Besides. I'll like to climb more V7 this season, but that will be on a lower priority

**My session plan**:

I will be using my home wall for a bulk of my training, the boulders that I target will be in 2 Tier based on  the effort I take to send the boulders

T1: 1-2 sessions

T2: 3-5 sessions

Here is my lovely home wall [https://imgur.com/98JoLnv](https://imgur.com/98JoLnv), its still need a lot of work though, before I stop moving the holds around lol.

Here are the type of session I'll be incorporating in my training cycle:

* Hard repeats: repeat 3-4 of T1 boulders, and 1-2 of T2 boulders, at the end of session I should have climbed at least 4 problems
* Near limit bouldering:  work on 2 new  T1 boulders , and 1 T2 boulder
* ~~Minimal Hang board: do 3x6s of 1 arm supported half crimp at 80% of my max, and middle 2 using no hang (weight is to be tested). Then set a few new boulders for Near limit session, probably try out a few moves for 20-30 minutes~~
* limit boulder: 1-3 really hard moves until I power down
* Antagonist: do 3x4 Bench press, 3x4 front squat, both 8/10 RPE, I'll paired them with some mobility that help me with the drop knee, heel hook, and high step
* Outdoor:  work on the boulder that I can send in 1 - 2 sessions, currently its V6-7
* Power endurance: do easier boulders from volume session or I'll go to gym and try to onsight stuff, either way, they will be in "on the minute" style

**My training cycle plan**:

I have roughly 24 weeks (15th May - 15th Nov) of training including deload weeks prior to the season, I will split them into 3 cycles, each cycle has a list of training cycle that I will rotate with one day off in between. I will take a deload week by the end of every cycle, basically 50% volume, same intensity.

Cycle I (12 weeks) :

* 1 day of hard repeats
* 2 day of near limit boulder
* 1 day of outdoor, if I can not make it then I will do a near limit instead

Cycle II  (5 weeks):

* 2 days of hard repeats
* 1 day of near limit boulder
* 1 day of outdoor,  if I can not make it then I will do a near limit instead

Cycle III (4 weeks):

* 1 day of  limit boulder
* 1 days of power endurance

**Things I haven't had it figured out:**

* How to progressive overload the volume session, to aim for more climbs say repeating 5-8 T1 boulders, or to keep it 5 at maximum but do harder stuff say repeating 5 T2 boulders
* ~~Dropping hang board for something else ? What would be a good replacement, a near limit boulder ?~~
* To do more volume early on and do more intensity as I approach the season, or vice versa
* To give up the idea of cycle at all and go with the flow
Any advice for new 30 y/o climber? 30 y/o male. Started climbing the past year- better late than never. I have access to a bouldering gym, trad, and bouldering all within a few minutes of where I live, so I'm pretty fortunate in that regard. 

As a new climber, I was curious if anyone had any recommendations or wisdom to share in terms of training and learning. I've purchased a few books including 'self coached climber', and '9 out of 10 climbers make the same mistakes', 'freedom of the hills' and will be reading them. I have no delusions of becoming an amazing climber, but would like to make sustained realistic progress over the next few years. Any advice is appreciated.
For people who have lost 5-10lbs, how did weight loss improve your climbing? I’m pretty lean already, but I could lose a few pounds. I’m just wondering if weight loss for the sake of climbing has been worth it for others. 

Did weigh loss make climbing easier for you? Will losing 5-10lbs make any difference on how I climb? 

(Note: I am currently 114lbs, and I am 5’0”.)
Increase wingspan strength Hey guys, new here, hope this is in the right place.  


I'll get right into it. I'm 5'9' with an even to slightly negative wingspan, I only boulder inside.  
I have no access to outdoor bouldering closer than an 8 hour drive, so I use boards for progression.  
I've been moonboarding for about 2-3 years pretty consistently. I've climbed 9 of the v9 benchmarks and 3 of the v10s.   


I'm looking for some advice on how to become more static and get better at pushing my wingspan out in a controlled manner to improve my outside skills. I climb fairly "snappy" and latch, the slow and delicate strength moves are a weakness such as "Nector of the Todds" D13 - J14.  
When I go for hard static moves that I'm talking about, my interior or pushing arm cannot go past lockoff and results are my hand is rotated wrong to desperately attempt to grab.  


Maybe I lack finger strength, when the holds are good it's never an issue until the holds get bad.  
 I train a lot of weighted pull-ups and I'd say I'm about 180% BW pull, and fingerboard frequently.   
Maybe I need patience and just keep going, either way if anyone has any recommendations, critiques, ETC. I welcome them all.
Climbing and sleep Hey guys, I have a bit of insomnia and wondering how others in my situation balance climbing and sleep. I still have a high training/climbing  frequency and am seeing progression, but I do worry that training/climbing after a night of bad sleep is putting me in a recovery hole. On the other hand, sacrificing climbing if I don’t sleep well is only gonna stress me out and then I’ll sleep worse.

If it matters I’m in college and mostly train on a small spray wall.
No climbing gym's around me in Alger Algeria (North Africa) been looking for someday's for any Gyms around me in the state of Alger in Algeria and didnt find anything.

fell inlove with the sport for 2yrs now thru Magnus Midtbo and always wanted to do it but never had time due to work. now i do have time but there is nothing around me that is even close to a climbing gym.

does anyone has a solution for a similar activity i can do or home workouts that mimick bouldering or whatever .. without obv installing a climbing wall due to me living in a apartment and lack of that equipment in my country.

pls lemme know, cause my hopes are rly rly down.
Here is some climbing correlations I found out during my last year study, if you are a climbing nerd like me you may enjoy ! (sample size = 220) (Test used : SSS V)
I been struggling with shoulder issues for some time.. (some may relate). I tried passive hanging every day inspired by Ido Portal and it most definitely gives me some release in the shoulder and neck area. An other exercise that stands out for me are wall slides.. to be continued...
Tension going back to old app platform! I noticed a response from tension in reviews on the App Store mentioning a change coming to the app. They are offering early beta access to the new Tension Board app, which is essentially the old app on the old platform. This is a super respectable decision on behalf of tension, who invested a ton of time and money on a new and ambitious app. I’m sure it was a difficult decision to go back to the old platform, and as an owner of their board, I really appreciate it.  

If you want early access to the app, email support@auroraclimbing.com
Another Emil Abrahamsson Daily Hangboard Routine Results Post Did the routine for 4 weeks (28 days) pretty religiously. Missed 3 days somewhere in the middle because of work. Otherwise hit it twice a day, maintaining a similar volume of climbing. Have hangboarded before but not frequently so very likely eeked out some newbie gains. Been climbing 3 or so years, V5 moonboard/outdoors, V6/7 indoors. Anyways, here are the results:

BW 135lb

Pre-routine:

-Half Crimp 20 mm 7s hang: 53 lb

-Half Crimp 15 mm BW hang: 10s

-Half Crimp 10 mm BW hang: maybe one second

-3FD 15 mm BW hang: unable to take feet off ground

After-routine: 

-Half Crimp 20 mm 7s hang: 75 lb

-Half Crimp 15 mm BW hang: 30s+

-Half Crimp 10 mm BW hang: 5s

-3FD 15 mm BW hang: 6s

Happy with the results as the work I put in was very minimal (20 minutes a day). I know there is some discussion about loss of tendon elasticity, I haven't noticed any finger discomfort but will update if I blow a tendon in the next few weeks. Hope this helps others who are on the fence about trying the routine.

As a side question for those who moonboard and know their finger strength. Are mine strong or weak for the grade?
Moonboard is the way (?) Just wanted to share with you guys my easy training schedule that helped me to improve from redpointing 7a to flash/OS 6c/7a and redpointing 7c.During the first pandemic i decided to build my own moonboard at my garage and started doing boulders.Unfortunately my fingers werent good enough and  got injuried 2 times in a row at my pulleys (nothing too bad anyway i had to stop bouldering for some months).

In the meantime i started doing a lot of 3x3 with some friends: i.e the first guy set 3 holds, the second guy has to repeat the 3 holds and set another 3, the third guy has to repeat the first 6 holds and set other 3 and so on till everybody fall down.

This helped me a lot on gaining power on my fingers and get some endurance as well.

After that period (i would say 3months of it) i started trying some circuits of Jolly Power on the moonboard classic (up to 40 movements!) for around 2 month.

This finally made me strong enough with the fingers and gave me the strenght to start bouldering as well... but the game changer of my training i think was the last thing i added since 2 months.

Instead of doing only 3x3 we mix it with bouldergin i.e: we start with an easy boulder (6b/6b+) then instead of jump off we climb down adding around 10 hard moves; when we reach the bottom we link another 6b/6b+ boulder and then another 10 hard moves to climb down.

For my skill level it's really challenging coz in a row you gonna have at least 10 explosive moves ( 2 boulders) and 20 hard moves and i think on this way you can simulate a lot the experience you gonna get on rock climbing outside.

TLDR: my training now it's like day: 1 day of only bouldering on moonboard, 1 day of 3x3 on moonboard, 1/2 days outside

I dont know if this can be usefull but i wanted to share with you guys and if you've any other ideas/suggestion to improve my training i'll be glad to listen to.
Ingraining Technique from Conscious to Automatic Hi r/climbharder, long time lurker here but first time posting!

I'd like to ask a question which I've been pondering for a while now. The gist of it is, **when you figure out movement patterns which allow you to succeed on specific climbs, how do you generalize them to new climbs and to an extent where they become "automatic" (instead of requiring conscious thought)?** Would especially appreciate it if the really strong folks of r/climbharder could weigh in here!

&amp;#x200B;

To facilitate the discussion, I'll provide some examples of movement patterns which I've figured out in the past few months from analyzing my climbing and also my own thoughts on how generalizable each movement pattern is.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Moves where hips are open and you need to drive hard with the opposing leg to reach the next hold. In this case, I've found that consciously squeezing my glute v.s. not doing so can be the difference between latching the next move or falling. My opinion now is that squeezing the glute is near-universally helpful for these types of hip-open tension-ey moves.
2. For those of you familiar with the climb [Across the Tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnAMl7bxX-0) V10 in Yosemite: the move at 0:27. Haven't stuck it, but got progressively closer over a couple of tries and the things I figured out were: need to really drive the left leg up (almost like a rockover, it's because I'm 6' and thicc so my butt sags very low otherwise), need to really squeeze the left glute to maintain tension through the entire move. These 2 cues make the move go from impossibly far to very doable. I think this particular microbeta is obviously extremely specific to this climb, though I'd imagine there are generalizations we can try to make to other similar climbs as well.
3. This might be somewhat hard to explain, but on high-foot, opposite-hand gaston lockoffs, I've found that if I initiate the move too high, my shoulder gets stuck in a position where I'm pulling *inward* into the wall instead of along the plane of the wall, and I'm not able to keep tension while reaching as far as I'd like. So instead I have to sag low to initiate the lock off move and then start locking off with my arms. Not sure if this is due to my terrible shoulder flexibility, or if this is a universal consideration in lockoff moves.

**Now my questions are:**

* now that we've figure out movement pattern adjustments such as 1, 2, 3 on a conscious level, how do we practice so that we can **automatically or subconsciously** generalize to new climbs? E.g. it'd be nice if one day I don't have to think "SQUEEZE THE GLUTES" on every hip open deadpoint, but instead, my body just does it automatically. I can sort of guess at this answer: just climb more and climb mindfully, but is there any other systematic thing which people do? Do you ever reach a point where you don't have to consciously thing about these cues anymore, or will you always rely on them to some extent?
* For examples such as 2 which are obviously very specific to one climb, but also indicative of a general pattern (for me, if you're on a slopey rail and with a high foot on, drive that leg up so your butt doesn't sag), how do you go about taking lessons learned from this one climb and ingrain them so you can send similar moves faster in the future?

**More about my background:**

Been climbing for 7.5 years, max bouldering grade V9 outdoors, exclusively boulder. I think I have the physical ability to send V11 (close on the one that I've been projecting) but haven't sent yet. For the first 4.5 years of climbing my approach was very much: get strong and figure out moves by repeatedly trying them. I pretty much did not know how to refine microbeta back then because I didn't use my brain while climbing and tried to intuit everything with my body. Thankfully, for the past 3 years, I've become a much more analytical climber, and therefore have a much better understanding of movement. Now I think one of my strengths is breaking down limit moves and finding micro-adjustments which work for my body. **However, I'm still unsure about the best way to make these micro-adjustments turn into automatic or intuitive technique, hence this (long and rambling) post.** Thanks!

Edit: BTW: not only looking for direct answers here since the direct answer is probably some variation of "just climb more"! Would also love to hear other's thoughts/experiences on this!
Got cleared to start climbing again after a traumatic brain injury Doctor said it's fine to start top-roping, as long as I'm avoiding any crazy falls and taking it easy. 

My vestibular rehab is coming along nicely and I'm making pretty quick progress. But...

Holy shit, it's *really* hard. I was climbing 5.12s regularly before the accident, and now I'm struggling with 5.9s.

I hope y'all understand how amazing this sport is and how amazing our bodies/brains are. Just remember that when you plateau. It feels kind of banal to most of us, but the sheer number of mental and physical processes you're undertaking when you climb is staggering.

Good luck, everybody 🥂
How to train for 7a bouldering? I have been on and off indoor bouldering for the past few years and slowly progressed to a point where I can flash 6a/6b and after some effort get 6c/6c+ routes in my gym. I would really like to push to 7a and consider training for the first time. What is the most bang-for-the-buck exercise/routine to add to my current "just climb what looks cool" regime?
Is there any place for steroids / PED's in climbing? As the sport develops and becomes more competitive, I've been thinking about the use of PED's. Not only for winning competitions, but for getting higher grades as it becomes much more about genetics at the top few climbers. In principle, it would be useful as it reduces recovery time allowing more training at high intensity, but it may lead to unwanted weight gain. Nootropics may also have a place. Anyone got any thoughts on what types would be used and in what manner? (disclaimer, I will not do steroids, I value my organs)
New study, somewhat obvious, but more evidence: Effects of Different Hangboard Training Intensities on Finger Grip Strength, Stamina, and Endurance
I’m using strength at the expense of technique I’m looking for some advice on how I can improve my climbing technique without training for strength. I’ve reached the point where being able to do more pull ups for example isn’t helpful as I’ll never need to do 13+ pull ups on any climb. (I always need to improve finger strength however)

I’m 29, female and have been climbing for 5 years, I’ve climbed a few 7B/ 5.12b sport routes and just sent my first 7B/ V8 boulder. 

I have okay technique but I really rely disproportionately more on strength I’ve found and I feel like training more strength is not going to help me improve (at my level) I would like to climb more efficiently and think that’s my main downfall- wasting energy unnecessarily.

If anyone has any videos of tips or drills that they could suggest so that I can really work on my technique I’d be very grateful.

Thanks!
Any advice on jumping more smoothly/more efficiently? Not sure how to pick better trajectories for big movies (climb below is DYLAN DYLAN DYLAN on the 30 degree).
Improving shoulder strength Which shoulder exercises should I do as a climber? 

I've heard that I should do "shouldery moves" on the wall to improve shoulder strength, but I find this unreliable and difficult to train consistently. The other prominent exercises I've found are with the theraband, which I do not have at my gym. Other than that, I have most of the other normal gym equipment. 

Thank you for your attention
Homewall PSA: Use 15/32" holes instead of 1/2" for Aurora LEDs The Tension board instructions say to drill 1/2" holes for the LEDs but my friend found that diameter was too large and often his lights will fall forward while climbing. The LED bulb max OD is about 1/2" and so there isn't much interference/friction to hold it in place if you drill a hole the same size. 

I found using a 15/32" hole gives enough interference for the LED bulbs to feel firm in the wall. The reduced hole size does not damage the LED since it is in a sealed housing with 4 rubber external tabs. The 4 tabs is what provides the interference/friction in the hole and the LED can still be removed without damaging anything; just be careful not to damage the wires when pushing the LED through the hole.

If you already drilled the LED holes to 1/2", a trick I found was to wrap the LED bulb with a folded post it note. It feels almost as solid as using a 15/32" hole.

I figured there's enough people in this subreddit that use their systems and future LED climbers can find this info helpful!
Kilter Home Wall Fullride 10x10 Review and Information After training and climbing on the Kilter Home Wall for half a year, I thought it might be helpful to put out information for the general training community on the pros, cons, buying process, installation, etc. considering there isn't really a full extensive review out there yet. I own the Kilter Home Wall with the LED kit, 10x10 Full Ride layout, and an an adjustable frame from [OnSite](https://store.theonsite.com/products/lifesaving-personal-wall-basic-edition?variant=39625927065686). I've spent most of my climbing time at 30, 40 and 45 degrees with a grade range up to V9/7C. I've been climbing for about a decade and juggle between trad, sport and bouldering throughout the year.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Kilter Home Wall is NOT your Gym's Kilter board!**

This is quite important as many people hear the word Kilter and will begin using their experience with the original layout interchangeably with the home wall layout. This extremely misleading as the home wall, particularly the Full Ride, is a completely different beast than the Kilter board you will find at your local gym. The Home Wall Full Ride is actually more similar to a spray wall than a moon board or even its fellow kilter cousin. It's basically if a spray wall and a hard ass LED board had a baby. A majority of the holds are absolutely atrocious where even the jugs on the home wall feel shallower than on the original layout. I wouldn't call the holds on my wall "comfortable", rather "realistic". Depending on your session, you may find you got quite the finger workout which I can definitely say was not the case on the many hours and months spent on the original layout. The focus with the home wall is clearly geared towards outdoor climbing where tension, raw finger strength, smaller moves, bad feet, and funky grip positions are common place. Even though the wall is designed with this philosophy, there's plenty of routes and room to work hard deadpoints and more explosive styles. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Buying a Kilter Home Wall**

The process is quite simple, just head to their website and inquire what you're looking for based on your ability and get a quote. The customer service I found to be fantastic from both Kilter and the frame subcontractor they work with. 

The elephant in the room for us climbers and perhaps one of two "cons" I have is what's this going to cost me? Kilter is easily the most expensive option out there but there are many different price tiers available and there are some huge upsides to the cost, making raw price differences between competition less straightforward. You have to consider how many more custom shaped holds you're getting with a 10x10 Full Ride over something like a Tension Board. Your cheapest option for a home training wall is a fixed spray wall you and your buddies slapped together. While cheaper, you need to know how to even build this, incurring the cost of lumber, screws, t-nuts, holds, and more which can easily run you thousands of dollars still (to equal the size and hold density of a KB 10x10 Full Ride). Additionally, you need to know how to set a spray wall effectively and then be motivated to train on your home board and have fun with it. Fun is huge factor you can't put a price on. I've trained on spray walls before and while yes, the best climbers in the world all use them, I ain't one of the best climbers in the world nor will I ever be. Some of us mortals need something fun to stay motivated (I find) and LED boards definitely provide that fun factor. 

In terms of cost of my setup, I paid for most of the premium options which you can trim out of your order if you want to go with Kilter. You can get the mainline instead of the Full Ride (and later upgrade). You can forgo the LED kit. You can get a smaller board. You can build your own static frame and even drill the plywood yourself (would seriously recommend at minimum subcontracting this task to a company with a CNC machine, planar, etc.). You can easily shave thousands of dollars off what I paid, ultimately paying up to half of what I paid if you so choose. If you truly wanted you could buy only the hold set without the LEDs and do everything yourself. While yes, this will look pretty expensive from then outside, you are getting premium hold quality and design that I think is better than the competition. I forwent padding and use my crash pads: 3 Metolius sessions, 1 Mad Rock duo, and an Organic Blubber which provides perfect coverage of most falls. I wouldn't really use less pads than that to feel safe alone. Prices are subject to change but here's what an order sheet looked like for domestic US:

|Item|Price USD|

|Frame + Winch|$4,000.00|

&amp;#x200B;

**My thoughts on assembly**

Assuming you're interested in an adjustable wall mounted frame for your home set up as well, get ready for the most complicated and tedious furniture assembly of your life. Before that, be prepared to wait many months for the holds to ship. I received the frame months before the holds and LEDs from Kilter. I'm a pretty handy dude with decent carpentry skills and was able to assemble almost everything by myself aside from some key steps involving lifting super heavy parts and bolting them together. You're definitely going to want a good impact driver, drill, socket wrench, and perhaps a saw if you plan on customizing the bottom of the board like I did. One key design flaw with OnSite's frame over Lemur is that you have to feed the LEDs through tiny triangular holes in the brace pieces over 50 times which is an absolute nightmare of a job if you don't have the room to lower the wall to 60 degrees like my space. The obvious advantage of OnSite over Lemur for prefabbed frames is that OnSite's option is infinitely cheaper and is more flush to the wall, giving you more space. Lemur is way easier to assemble and less elbow grease. The process of putting the holds on was definitely a pain in the ass too, having to mark every hole with the hold number and angle over 200 times before even going through the holds and finding their location on the board. From unboxing freight to physically climbing on my wall was probably around 100 man-hours, but that includes building a platform raising the start of the board about 1.5 feet from the floor.

**What climbing on the 10x10 Full Ride is like, who it's for, and how it compares** 

Probably what most people are actually interested in; how does this $7,000 - $14,000 toy perform as a training tool and a standalone climbing system. I've climbed on Tension, Moon, and original Kilter boards before and I daresay, the 10x10 Full Ride from Kilter smashes them all. All of these options are going to provide you with a fantastic option to improve and have fun but the Home Wall Full Ride does so much right packed into a 10x10 foot square. Firstly, the lack of kickboard works to its benefit, forcing a more outdoors-y climbing style and providing opportunity to work on hard/awkward sit starts. The hold density and variety beats the competition squarely and the only type of hold missing here are pockets which is not a too big of deal. Underlings are a bit of weakness on the board I've found as there are some good options for working on that bicep tension but not too many. Pinches are the strongest aspect of this board and perhaps there's something to that given Ondra is quoted saying they are the best all around hold type for training. Crimps range from slopey, to small, to incut and offer a variety of options to set and climb easily into V12/8A range. Lastly, there enough "easy" holds to allow plenty of V0 - V3 climbs to be set for warmups or getting stronger if that grade challenges you.

In the first two months of climbing on my board not only did a feel like a kid in a candy store, I had remarkable bouldering improvements with very little supplementary training outside of quality sessions on the Home Wall. The main reason I attribute is the reduction of junk mileage. More so than the original Kilter layout specifically, I find it incredibly difficult to accrue junk mileage on the Home Wall Full Ride. Sessions test your finger strength, scapular engagement, core tension, and foot work. Because this is an LED wall, you get the advantages of having certified routes at various grade ranges to accurately adjust the intensity of a session without having to do much work yourself. Ultimately in the long-term for pseudo-motivated individuals with lives beyond climbing, this is a massive upside as it allows for you to turn your brain off and have a good climbing session if you want. I find that there are plenty of problems (over 3,000 currently) but this is perhaps the other downside which is the small community around the Home Wall currently. 

Going adjustable I think is fully worth the investment, you're already spending a bunch of money, might as well greatly increase the flexibility of the wall. My wall only operates between 30 - 50 degrees which I find perfect for my needs. I can train endurance/power endurance in a variety of ways. From doing 4x4's, to turning the lights off and moving around for set time or moves, to setting a grade range on the app and having a partner swipe randomly through problems and try to link as many as possible without getting off the wall. Because the Home Wall Full Ride is fundamentally a spray wall first and an LED board second you get the best of both worlds. Adjustability means endless headroom for difficulty and even at 30 degrees the Kilter Home Wall has multiple V12/8A routes and harder. 

This wall can be great for anyone theoretically but the most value would be derived from someone climbing at least V4/6b outside. I would imagine on the other end of the spectrum if you're climbing V12/8A in a session outside you're probably not going to get too much value from this board either as it may not be specific enough for that level of climbing. This part is hard to comment on because the Home Wall Full Ride is nails hard at 50 degrees so it's possible a solid V-double-digit climber might actually get a lot of value here. Based on my experience, the most value will definitely be derived for someone looking to push their grades into the V6/6c+ through V10/7c+ range but the upper limit might actually be higher. The wall is definitely more focused on bouldering, obviously. Route climbers looking to push into the 5.12a - 5.13d (I have no context for 5.14 or training for that grade) and beyond range will get value here, due to the fact the Full Ride can be used to push your climbing specific strength farther. Again, climbing on the Home Wall Full Ride is much more natural but equally hard compared to Moon or Tension so the translation to outdoor climbing is fantastic (assuming you have a solid base already). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Closing thoughts**

Do I feel like I got my moneys worth? Absolutely, yes. The build, design and material quality I received is fantastic. The man hours saved on construction is worth it for me (factor in what your vocation pays you hourly into the hours spent building a wall). Trying to set aside confirmation bias, I genuinely believe (and friends/wife also have weighed in) that the Kilter Home Wall Fullride is worth the price difference over Moon Boards. Ever since climbing on my setup I've had zero need or desire to climb gym routes or on the 12x12 original Kilter board. Between the Home Wall, supplementary training, and regular outdoor climbing I've been getting stronger much faster than I ever have previously while having a ton of fun. Unfortunately, I can't say the Kilter Home Wall is for everyone because the monetary barrier of entry is high for a lot of people. However, buying the system with a prefabbed frame means your purchase is closer to an investment because there is resell value and you can break the whole thing down and set it up somewhere else. I actually do know someone who sold their LED board and frame for more than they paid due to long wait times and material shortages from manufacturers. 

I hope I've provided some useful information but I'm not much a social media person nor do I really post on Reddit much so I'm pretty inexperienced here. I didn't proof read much either so I apologize for grammatical and syntactical errors. I'll try to respond to questions but no promises.

Happy training ya'll!
What "just climb" actually means, and why it's the best advice for almost anyone. Long post incoming.

Just climb is the way to go. And it's the best advice to almost any question regarding climbing. Yet on this sub, you see it all the time. Climbers who's been climbing for a year, and feel like they're plateaud, so now they need to hangboard, train their core twice at day etc. The only advice these people should get is "just climb" and here's why.

Climbing is a skill sport. Read that again. Most people think they understand it, but they don't. You might even have convinced yourself that you get it, but chances are you don't get it enough. Unless you're climbing 8c or more, strength is almost never the thing holding you back. When Adam ondra was climbing 8c+, he could do 13 pull-ups, and barely do lockouts. When he climbed silence, he couldn't do a proper front lever. Steve McClure is in his 50s. He warms up on 7c-8a. The holds aren't bigger for him, nor are the movement easier. It's his technique that does it. It was Adam ondras technique that made him climb 8c+, not his horrendous pulling strength. Technique is the reason 12 year olds are flying up 7b for warm up in the gym, or why that old guy in his 60s are still crushing 8as. Now I can already imagine the comments about genetics and talent and blah blah blah. About how they're pros, and their advice doesn't apply. Chances are that if you think that, it's because you want to think that and have convinced yourself that's it's true. There's no grounds for thinking that, since you obviously can't measure a persons talent. The best thing I can say is that you're probably more talented than you think. Unless you're truly projecting at your limit, you probably don't know how good you are.

Another thing I wanna mention is the 9c test. I actually really like the 9c test, but probably not for the reason you think. I like the 9c test because it shows me if my technique is the thing holding me back or not. I see a lot of comments/posts about how people scored 8a on the 9c test, yet only climb 7a. That means it's their technique holding them back, plain and simple. When I was climbing 8b solidly, I would estimate my 9c test score to be about 7c, maybe even less. That was because technique was what drove my climbing, not strength. The vast majority of people I see is the complete opposite. Another point to make is to look at most female professional sport climbers. Many of them can't hang in one arm of a 20 mm edge. Yet a common mantra is that you need to be able to do that to climb 8c. So that's clearly not true. Again goes to show that technique is what will take you far, not strength.

So in case you are one of those people who are way too strong for your climbing level, here's my advice: just climb. More specifically, just lead climb. Lead climb at your limit, every session. Don't be afraid of falling(easier said than done though). Lead climbing at your limit is what will improve your technique. And when I say at your limit, I'm not talking about getting pulleys and injuries, I'm talking about at your max grade. If you're climbing 5.11s, chances are you can do 5.12. So start playing around on 5.12s. You'll fall, but that's how you're gonna improve your technique. That's why just climb is the best advice. Climbing is a skill sport, and you'll only improve the skill of climbing by pressuring yourself and your skills.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: a lot of people in the comments are making my post out to be something it's not. No, I'm not saying you don't need strength. I'm saying you're likely strong enough. People also seems to be forgetting that you get stronger while climbing too. Not hangboarding is not equal to not getting stronger.
What "train fingers" actually means and why it's the best advice for almost everyone This is in response to the other post on "just climb" that I (heavily) disagree with. I also saw a recent hot take that climbing is primarily a strength sport and I'm actually leaning more towards this idea as I get more experience (obviously this comes with my own biases)

The crux of the "climbing as primarily a strength sport" idea is that most people can acquire the climbing skill over enough time to climb hard (lets say V-double digit) but many fewer people will be able to build that appropriate amount of elite finger and hand strength. **I think this is likely true from a statistical sense.** Climbing is generally a pretty intuitive sport (definitely more so than say golf or even tennis) AND it's f\*\*\*\*\*\* FUN!  just look at kids scrambling up the monkey bars. So unless someone has horrible proprioception - most people are able to figure out good to excellent technique (for their body) after a few years of climbing.

However, I think getting elite hand strength is a much more a blocker to climbing hard. Fingers, wrists, elbow, shoulder tendons adapt slowly, get injured easily, and especially for someone who starts later in life, or is on the heavier side - it is HARD to get the minimum strength benchmarks to climb at V10+ (say one arm hang on 20mm for any amount of time). There's a saying I like that "if the holds on your project were all jugs - would it still be hard?" - obviously over-simplifying but I think there is a big kernel of truth there.

I also think that as a community - we inherently value technique and "climbing well" over strength. If my ultimate goal is to V10, why should it matter if I send with more strength or more technique? If I can get there in 3 months by training fingers but with no technique improvements vs. 6 months of just doing drills then I think most people would choose the former no? "Technique" is just a tool for sending (and arguably could be defined as just taking weight off your fingers) just like "strength" is and neither should placed on a pedestal.

So what is my advice? Hangboard early and hangboard often. Make those early investments in your finger strength so you can reap the rewards when you get to a place where fingers are holding you back (which for the vast majority of people it eventually will be).

**If you're just starting** \- hangboard light to get blood flow and stimulation while climbing lots to build that technique base.

**If you're more experienced** \- invest in hangboarding a few times a week (even at the expense of SOME climbing) to get focused stimulus and NEVER STOP investing in hand strength - it will always be useful. (I would also add that this sentiment is heavily echoed in Ned Feehally's new book Beastmaking - and he would know better than me)

**TLDR** \- I believe climbing is \~70% a hand and finger strength (to weight) sport and \~30% a skill sport. I agree pull ups (and probably a lot of other lifts) don’t matter that much but **being able to apply force to the holds through my fingers and hand** is the single most important thing in climbing bar none and probably is or will be the blocker to improvement for pretty much everyone.

**post script** \- I would be willing to bet a fair amount of money that basically every girl (at least making semis in lead and boulders so not randos) can pretty easily hang one arm on 20mm. For sure the regular finals girls can **with** added weight (janja, natalia, brooke, laura, etc.) not sure where the previous poster got that data point / anecdote...

**post post script** \- Also Adam at a young age CERTAINLY had elite++ crimp and pinch strength relative to his body weight which is what allowed him to send hard (agree that front levers don't matter really that much at all). Same with dave graham - a wizard at climbing definitely but also a wizard at crimping and pinching HARD.

**edit:** loving the discussion guys - hopefully it makes us a better community :-)

I wanted to add a fun thought experiment that might help clarify the 2 positions -

Let's say I take 100 Adam Ondras and 100 random dudes with no climbing experience (roughly same age and same height and weight as Adam eg. average joe who goes bouldering for the first time).

I take the brains from the 100 Adam Ondras and transplant them into the random joe gumbies and vice versa. Then I give both groups infinite psych and resources to train and improve (basically full-time job).

After 5 years - they all meet up and do a bouldering competition where we tally the combined v-points of the two groups afterwards.

Which group wins?

1. The Adam Ondra bodies but Joe Gumby minds (suggesting that climbing is more physical than mental / skill)
2. The Joe Gumby bodies but Adam Ondra minds (suggesting that climbing is more mental / skill than physical)
What 'training' actually means, and why everyone should do it The following is a list of truisms that are both hackneyed and, ahem, true...

1. Let me start by defining training as 'climbing with intention.' Whether you're doing all of your training on the wall, supplementing a small percentage of it with off the wall exercises, or doing most of your training off the wall (bad idea), you're training. The majority of this post will refer to off the wall, supplemental training - especially areas that I feel are neglected.
2. **Reorient your thinking: shoot for the minimum, not the maximum, effective dose.** This is the main hinderance to the super-psyched among us. Doo too much and you won't recover. The lack of recovery will lead to injury or burn-out. Every time.
3. Technical training is often neglected. **You can train for climbing on your rest days by observing yourself climbing.** Film your sessions, note the technical breakdowns, learn the techniques that might make the move easier. Of course, you need to be aware of the various techniques available to you before you can begin to apply them them. Don't worry about what others might think about you walking around with your tripod - you're climbing for you.
4. Training isn't some magic-bullet - it'll take many intelligently-designed training cycles to see any results other than the neurological adaptations that relatively-newer or undertrained trainees perceive as physiological adaptations.
5. The older you are, the more important INJURY PREVENTION \[EDITED FROM BRO-SCIENCE\] becomes. This is where doing things like squats and deadlifts can really make a difference: ground falls take their toll, strength makes you more resilient. Longevity increases your likelihood of sending harder, and there are plenty of examples of old dudes crushing.
6. Adhering to a well-structured training plan is where most of us fall short. The extra half hour you spend on the project or accruing volume will add up. The deload week you failed to skip will bite you eventually.
7. Your recovery is *probably* more important than your supplemental training. Not sleeping? Not stretching? Climbing too many days on? Not eating enough? All this stuff is inter-related and often neglected, because it's a lot harder to address than your training.
8. Your mentality is *definitely* more important than your supplemental training. I'm not just talking about 'trying hard' here, although this is probably the most important (and unquantifiable) thing as relating to performance. I'm talking about how you frame success and failure within your session. A helpful little expression that one of my mentors said to me was to 'focus on the fight, not the victory' and to gauge success based on effort rather than result. Did you fight harder than you did last session? That's a win. Did you try hard for your first time ever? That's potentially the most important moment in your entire climbing career. Now that you know how, you can begin to quantify your effort. If 1/20 attempts is a 'high effort', then the moment you achieve 2/20, your session becomes doubly-productive. Remember, you can control the amount of effort you put into a thing, you cannot control success or failure. Google 'outcome independence'. Frame the quality of your session around how hard you tried, not on whether you sent. This is one of the many ways to stay motivated during those otherwise seemingly-futile projecting sessions!
9. Your brain/mental health is probably a bigger prohibitive factor than you realize. Are you repeating a climb with the sole intention of impressing or demoralizing someone in the gym? Are you envious of the climbers around you? Resentful of the comp kids? How do you treat failure? Do you spend a lot of time outside of climbing pissed off? The effects of things like cortisol (resulting from stress and anger) on your ability to focus, to produce power, etc. is greater than you might realize. Fix your brain and your body will follow.
10. **'Comparison is the thief of joy.'** Stop basing your training on what others around you are doing (caveat: if you notice someone whose built like you, and climbs like you, improving when you are not, it might be worth asking them what they're doing differently). Start developing the ability to assess your weaknesses and address them accordingly.
11. Most people take a myopic view of their training. I assume most of us are somewhere between 22-32. Consider the number of studs at your gym in the 35-50 age range. You can be one of them. You don't need to climb V11 by 30. Take the longer view of training and you will be a better climber in the end.

Closing thoughts:

Flexibility is a form of strength at the end range of motion that allows for particular techniques. If you can get into a deep drop-knee, all the sudden your finger strength matters less than if you're hucking for a hold straight-on.

Often on steep terrain, core strength (anti-rotation and your ability to weight your feet) is what allows for you to turn your hips in. Especially true if tall and heavy (relatively).

The stronger your fingers are, the more time you have to get into the correct positions. However, it's possible-to-probable that the reason you're pumped is because you did something wrong a move or two prior.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think the problem is 'training', I think that the problem is performing an excessive amount of training that you're not recovering from. Or being so strong that you can lock off every move gratuitously and fail to learn proper movement mechanics.

Instead of dropping training altogether ^((shoulder strength and a baseline of finger and core strength (note: NOT the ability to do a front-level to climb V8, more like the ability to do the ab-wheel on your knees or the proprioceptive capacity to prevent rotation on big lateral moves (which can be gained through exercises like Palof presses are always good to maintain, if only for injury prevention))), focus on one to two areas.

**Reorient your thinking: shoot for the minimum, not the maximum, effective dose.**

&amp;#x200B;
"Just climb" vs training: the most important point that should be talked about instead (injury) So there's some great discussion going in other posts about whether "just climb" or "train fingers" (or other) is the best advice to give people looking to improve. I'm making this post because I think there's one point that is not being discussed at all (only saw one comment buried amongst many), and it's a point I consider so important it needs to be emphasised in its own post.

# Injury needs to be the most important consideration

Safety and injury-prevention is the most important consideration in any 'how' or 'why' question related to climbing.

More important than sending/performance. More important than fun. We can't climb, let alone perform at a high level, when we are injured. We can't improve if we can't climb. We can't do the thing we love (climb) if we are injured. Injuries are generally bad for our health, wellbeing and life in general. So, in any discussion about advice to give new climbers or climbers looking to improve, preventing injury must be more important than performance, improvement and progress.

# The "just climb" advice

This leads me to now explaining why I think the advice "just climb" is dangerous for most (but not necessarily all) people. Again, I will not go into a discussion about whether just climbing or strength/finger training will lead to better performance improvements -- because my point is that it is only of secondary importance to injury-prevention.

The "just climb" advice tends to include a few assertions/implications (sorry if I'm being overly simplistic here):

1. You will make the necessary strength gains through climbing.
2. If you are stronger than your climbing grade requires, technique is what's holding you back, and you improve that with more climbing.
3. It is unnecessary for most people to strength train because they are stronger than their climbing grade requires.
4. And sometimes (but not always) it is also implied: skill/technique is what makes a good climber, and being stronger than necessary is not desirable.

The fourth implication seems to fetishise technique and skill as being the measure of a pure climbing ideal. Not everyone goes so far as to assert this. But in any case I want to point out, for reasons below, that it is a dangerous ideal to be peddling.

# Climbers should be stronger than their climbing grade requires and why "just climb" is dangerous advice for most

Climbing is a sport that is extremely demanding on the body. Pushing the body too much, too often, seriously increases the risk of injury. In order to reduce injury risk in climbing, the body needs to be properly prepared for the stress it is being put under during climbing. The best way is to make sure your body is stronger than it needs to be for the given grade/move you are trying to attempt.

Here are a variety of points/examples to illustrate the argument:

* When we strength train, we usually lift below 100% of our one rep max, because we know it's safer. Lifting at 100% of 1RM is taking on unnecessary injury risk. If we are not stronger than a grade/move requires, then we are basically operating at the equivalent of 100% of 1RM. Not safe. This is especially true if we rest on the assertion (1) above. The "just climb" advice is telling climbers to get stronger by regularly operating at 100% of their 1RM.
* And potentially more dangerously, the "just climb" advice is suggesting that this is a good way to safely train strength. Of course, climbers should always be conscious of not having "hard" sessions too frequently. But because the "just climb" advice often implies that climbing is a substitute for training strength, it is easy for those listeners/readers receiving the advice to misunderstand/misapply it and do "hard" sessions too frequently.
* You know those times you're standing on one foot, and it unexpectedly slips off? Suddenly your shoulders, wrists and/or fingers are shocked with the load of your body, which the foot was taking before, and which you likely haven't prepared (mentally or physically) your shoulders, etc to take. That sudden loading creates a real risk of injury. If you're way stronger than you need to be, your shoulders/wrists/fingers will be better able to take the unexpected load safely. If you are not stronger than the grade/move requires, you're taking a risk everytime you try that climb.
* You know those climbers who climb with hunched backs? Yeah, that's poor form/posture, and puts them at serious risk of shoulder injury. Telling them to climb more isn't going to correct their form. Almost always, the reason why they have poor form is because of a weakness in their scapula and/or other related muscles around the shoulder. The best way to fix their form is have them train to mitigate their muscle imbalances. If climbers following the "just climb" advice just keep climbing harder and harder without addressing the root cause of their poor form, injury will be inevitable. Yes, they can send the route, but they aren't doing their body any favours. By contrast, if they are stronger than they need to be (but strong in the right places and in a balanced manner), then good form will be relatively effortless. There are many many more examples of how muscle imbalances, weakness in accessory/stabilising muscles and so on can heighten risk of injury in climbing, and also just sport in general.
* Further, even for those who usually climb with good form, often when they are climbing at their limit they lose some of their good form. Think of how usually you will hold onto the wall with your scapula back and down, and your elbows down (at least I hope you are). And think of those times you are desperately hanging onto a difficult hold and suddenly your elbow wings out at 90 degrees, and your shoulder is hunched up. Somehwere, a muscle weakness caused you to lose good form. And now your shoulder is in a compromised/unstable position with heightened injury risk. Climbers need to do some accessory strength training to address the root cause of the poor form (muscle weaknesses). If they are stronger than they need to be, they can maintain good form in even the most demanding positions/moves. The "just climb" advice just gets climbers to continue to compromise their safety.
* Some individuals come into climbing with a strong physical foundation. Too often I hear people say "if you can already lift X, you're stronger than you need to be, just climb". But this misses the point that climbing tests the body in specific ways that other physical activities do not. The most obvious example here is fingers. Now I am not giving an opinion either way that the advice should be to hangboard early (that's another discussion). But I am saying that the fact that someone is strong in certain ways, doesn't mean their body is adequately ready for the specific physical demands of climbing. Telling them to "just climb" is telling them not to think about where their physical weaknesses lie, and what they need to work on to reduce their risk of injury.

# Conclusion

Of course, there's dangerous advice that people give out about how to strength train too. The risk of overtraining is an obvious example that comes to mind. But I think that starting a conversation about how training can contribute to climbing progress necessarily leads to the question of what/how best to train. And that is when considerations like safety will more naturally come into the discussion (though I do think we can improve a great deal in this regard still).

On the other hand, simply telling climbers to "just climb" (including its more nuanced versions like "climb with proper intent/attention to specific skills, etc") fails to get climbers to prepare their bodies for the stresses they will face during climbing. For this reason, during these discussions about what advice to give to climbers, I believe we as a community owe it to everyone in this sport to talk about injury-prevention more than we already are, and to stop making everything solely about performance.

Thanks for reading my long post. I am about to go away and will be completely offline for 12 days, but I look forward to reading the comments when I'm back.
Understanding the training board and why so many dislike it I am relatively new to climbing. I have been bouldering for 10 months, and I started using the kilter board regularly. about 2 months ago. I used to be able to hit 2's on the board when I started, but I shot up to being able to climb v3's, and most v4's. The kilter board is such an amazing tool for getting better at climbing, so I have a question to ask people:

&amp;#x200B;

Why do so many people hate the kilter board, and other training boards? It's one of things that's improved my climbing the most.
The average professional athlete did their sport for 10 years before making it pro How long have you been climbing for? Since this is the week of rants... Just climb. Just hangboard. Just moonboard. Just just just... Just have fun. Climbing is a sport like any other, and it takes years or decades to "master" any sport and really find your limit. Yes there's the occasional story of someone with natural abilities following some crazy training technique and seeing huge gains in incredible amounts of time. The vast majority of these climbers were either a previous athlete from another sport or have a rare gift. 

&amp;#x200B;

The most important thing in your training is *making it through your first 5 years or so.* Your tendons and body need time to adapt to climbing. There's things you can do to rush this process but the main thing you will accomplish is hurting your body. Does hangboarding work best with your busy schedule? Go for it! Are you super stoked on hard bouldering? Get after it! Do you have a really solid group of lead climbing partners and always have a great time? Awesome! Remember to rest and stop getting frustrated at yourself for failing. You're allowed to make mistakes and try again. That's the most important part of the process. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I first started climbing I was really into weightlifting. I (female) could do about 8-10 pullups no problem. I freaking *sucked* at rock climbing. I would take multiple times on top rope every route over 5.9 for years. I basically refused to lead climb and hated taking big falls bouldering. Absolutely trash technique. 7 years later I feel entirely solid on 5.10+ sport and 5.9 trad. I've sent multiple 5.12s outside and have started projecting 5.13. I've learned more about movement on rock and the way my core works and just *how to rock climb* more than anything else. I definitely have less muscle mass and overall strength than when I started climbing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Climbing is an incredible sport and as soon as you stop genuinely enjoying your training and getting frustrated you risk injury and burn out. Climb easy routes for fun. Find situations where falling feels very well within your comfort zone and find ways to enjoy falling. Surround yourself with people that lift you up. Just have fun. Rant over....
On Reading Beta Seeing as many people come here asking for beta, I thought I'd post my thoughts on the meta.

&amp;nbsp;

Stay open-minded, expose yourself to fresh ideas

* Keep a mindset of that there is always more beta to try. Dynamic climbers can try more static moves. Shorter climbers can try to reach more often. Nothing is more self-defeating than believing you cannot do a certain move without ever trying it.

* Don't fall prey to thinking there is nothing to learn from a weaker climber. Consider that at the weaker's limit problem, they might only send it with the perfect beta, while you sent it with power. This goes for climbers that are not the same body shape as you as well. I've discounted beta from taller or shorter climbers before only to realize that I indeed could do the same beta after exhausting all other possibilities.

* Just because there are no chalk or rubber doesn't mean it's not worth trying, especially outdoors. Lynn Hill famously said the foot is where it needs to be.

&amp;nbsp;

Learn how to experiment

* Use adjacent climbs to cheat to the crux to test moves. If you are stuck on a problem or projecting, don't waste precious energy starting from the bottom. Barring no easier moves, get a friend to give you a boost. No shame.

* Experiment with as many things you can think of as possible. Often times, I see people only try different sequences, when there are a lot of micro beta to learn. Here's a short list you can experiment with that can easily be much longer: climbing speed, adjust the thumb location, focus on different parts of the body when you dyno, raise or lower the foot angle, face the hip the other way, the direction your chest and head leans before you make the move, etc etc.

&amp;nbsp;

Understand your body's abilities

* An important skill to learn is figuring whether a certain beta is impossible for you or if it's only a matter of tweaking it. Often times, it's not obvious. This why sometimes, you'll doubt your beta, see another climber flash it with your beta, then you send it next go. People say it's confidence, but a lot of times, you actually intuitively picked up some minor tweaks by mimicking the other climber. Being mindful here will really help learning your limits.

* Also, just try a bunch of different beta for fun. Every time you surprise yourself with a move you didn't know you could do, you just leveled up. Try to make this happen as often as possible. Your mind has a map of all the possible moves your body can perform, and someone who experiments often for fun will have a much better imagination than someone who doesn't. It's important to know that the map is contextual, and sometimes you can trick your brain into learning something. For example, on a lot of climbs, if I cannot do a certain beta, I imagine my hand hold to be a different kind of hold and think if that would make it possible. Sometimes, that is actually enough to correct my body position to make the move.

&amp;nbsp;

Watch climbing videos

* This is just a cheat in gaining experience that it should be illegal. Watch hard sends, watch comps, and try to identify how they came to their conclusions and also what body positions they are able to do that you haven't ever done. Don't just watch in awe, but try to imagine yourself doing those moves. If you don't understand how a move a climber made is possible, that's probably a good place to rewatch in slo-mo.

&amp;nbsp;

Read beta backwards

* Instead of imagining how you can get higher and higher up the problem, think about the position your body needs to be in at the end of the crux. Now imagine what move you need to make in order to get into that position. Keep going backwards until you arrive at the start of the crux.

That's all I can think of atm. Would love to hear more ideas on how to improve reading beta myself.
Long term finger strength programming? I've started using the finger strength program on crimpd and I really like it so far. I also do twice a day light no hangs. But the program in in cycles of 6 weeks.

Does that mean you can just progress by doing 6week cycles indefinitely(with increasing weight) or is this something you're not meant to do constantly? If you were lifting weights you would follow a program until you could bench press like 225lb, and at some point change it up for your next goal when linear progress stops.

If you treated finger strength like lifting weights how would you organize training to reach a 140% bw hang, or change your training to reach 170% when basic progress slow? Or is treating half crimp strength as a lifting exercise a wrong approach?
I can climb hard without pain but when I do casual tasks such as squeeze a spray bottle or a foam ball, my middle finger DIP joint/A4 have significant pain. Any ideas? Thank you [removed]
For those of you who has had finger injuries, did your fingers feel sore or normal when you injured them? Recent saw a few videos of pulleys rupturing and now I can't get that sound out of my head. Personally I've never experienced any finger injuries thus far, been climbing 2 years and currently climbing V6/7 indoors. I've noticed that I've lost some psychological edge because I can't stop thinking about the sound of the pulleys rupturing.  

So my question is this: did your fingers feel completely normal before you injured them, or were they sore and it was due to overworking. Could fingers that otherwise feel completely healthy get injured out of nowhere? Thanks for taking your time!  

edit: thanks for all the responses! 

To summarize what I've read in a lot of these comments: it seems that a lot of injuries happen in pockets, or due to foot slips. As for my original question, it does seem that a lot of injuries occur on fingers that otherwise felt normal, so that's a little unsettling lol. It really puts an emphasis on proper care and rest. If a finger can be injured feeling completely normal, then you should really listen to your body when some of your fingers are sore.
Best ways to improve lock off strength I noticed today that on the campus board, I struggle to go up more than 2 rungs without being matched, and I’m assuming that it’s got something to do with my lock off strength, or maybe just pulling strength in general. Are there any ways other than just campus boarding more to increase this type of strength? I feel like this is my main limiting factor at the moment, as my project requires a campus like manoeuvre off one hand, and I just can’t hit it. Cheers :)
At what point do you feel comfortable training 2 days in a row? I'll try to be somewhat brief, but I have been climbing for 2.5 years, mostly sport climb outdoors and am projecting 12d, boulder occasionally around V7 at the most.

I climb on a friend's spray wall mostly for training and sometimes on a rope in the local gym. The past year I have really embraced the idea that I am getting strong through focusing on not overtraining and resting well. With that in mind my schedule typically is to train indoors on Tuesday and Thursday nights and climb one day outdoors on the weekends, sometimes both days but rarely. This leaves me always resting at least one day between climbing days.

The summer is here where I am and it is too hot to climb hard outdoors for the next 3 months so I am beginning to focus just on training and improving my climbing. I have started hangboarding in the mornings on Tuesdays and Thursdays in addition to my climbing schedule. I'm cautious of climbing too hard as I begin to incorporate hangboarding and my fingers may need more rest.

I know that reading various training plans occasionally suggest training two days in a row to increase volume of training overall to more than 3 days a week that I am currently at. My question is those of you that have done this how did you weigh the pros and cons of sacrificing rest to increase training? I am generally guided by listening to the signs from my body and not trying too hard if I am fatigued.

My general goals are to improve both my sport climbing and bouldering and to limit my chances of injury. The spray wall I train on is relatively steep at 52 degrees and the climbing style outdoors here is often overhanging thuggy sandstone so sometimes the style of training and climbing that I do leaves me wary of climbing two days in a row due to overall fatigue.

I'd love to hear anyone's thoughts on training multiple days in a row or how to begin incorporating this if I feel that it would be beneficial. I know my question is pretty general and subjective but would appreciate any perspective.
How to make moonboard moves less desperate? I’ve been told to look into rooting. I actively think about it while repeating past sends trying to do it as smoothly and effortless-looking as possible, but even thought it felt easy, I can see on the recording that my hip and shoulders still drop when I catch that next hold, especially on my weaknesses like high and far foot lock offs. Do I just need to be physically stronger?
Lifting weights causes growth plate injuries or delays growth - a common myth debunked There was a recent post on epiphyseal/growth plate injuries. Someone physiotherapist had suggested to not do weighed pull ups, because of the risk for growth plate injury.

People who disagreed with the physio were scientifically correct, but were downvoted for no apparent reason.

First of all, this is a weird suggestion by a physiotherapist who is not trained in issues concerning epiphyseal growth or bone development. Those issues concern a physician who is specialiced in sport medicine, orthopedics or pediatry, depending on the specifics of the issue. A physiotherapist cannot make such diagnoses and should not give advice on the topic without consulting a specialiced physician, because he/she simply lacks the expertise.

All of the articles provided here can be accessed in sci-hub using the PMID code.

There is a good commentary on this issue Titled “**There Is No Need to Avoid Resistance Training (Weight Lifting) Until Physeal Closure**” written by Dr. Micheal T. Milone who is a practicing hand surgeon and supervised by tri Fotios Thoumakaris who is a professor of orthopedics and specialiced in sport medicine ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24393806/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24393806/)).

They conducted a questionnaire on **orthopedic surgeon of which 85% disagreed** in whole or partly with the statement “resistance training (‘weight lifting’) should be avoided until physeal closure”. They also conclude that almost all studies published that report epiphyseal injuries are related to trauma, almost exclusively to fractures. These fractures happened as a result of a fall or contact in a sport, not lifting weights. Some people were linking these studies in the previous post, but these studies had no relation to issue discussed. This sentence pretty much sums up to topic “**In fact, no prospective youth–resistance-training research study has reported any acute injury to youth growth plates**”.

There was also a study on 96 kids between ages of 6 and 12 who did one rep max test and not a single kid had any injuries or other adverse events ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12580672/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12580672/)).

There is also this review that has a subsection called “Strength training myths” ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23015875/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23015875/)). “Numerous myths concerning strength training in children deserve discussion. **One misunderstanding concerns strength training and growth plate injuries.** Participation in almost any type of sport or recreational activity carries a risk of injury. A well-supervised strength training program has no greater inherent risk than that of any other youth sport or activity.” **“Sports such as gymnastics and baseball, which involve repetitive impact and torque, provide a greater risk of epiphyseal injury.”** If teens shouldnt do weighed pull ups, should we also forbid them to participate in baseball and gymnastics?

Bear in mind that there are already numerous of national programs that train kinds in weightlifting, powerlifting or strength training in general. Hundreds of thousands of kids are participating all over the world.

Contact sports such as wrestling, hockey or even football (soccer) have higher rates of injuries and risk for epiphyseal injury.

There is also a lot of studies on weight training and risk of injuries. Lifting weights is one of the safest sports out there. ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27328853/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27328853/) ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27707741/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27707741/)). Football, wrestling, soccer, hockey, gymnastics, lacrosse, basketball and many others have higher injury rates than lifting weights ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1941297/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1941297/)). The reason for low injury rates is likely the highly controlled and stable way lifting with added weights is performed.

I was unable to find a single study that reported epiphyseal injuries as a result of resistance training acutely or in the long term.

I think this pretty much sums up the issue and I hope everyone who thinks lifting heavy risks an epiphyseal injury changes their mind.

P.S. I am not saying that all the studies presented here are perfect or even the best ones to make the argument. Conducting a throughout literature review for a reddit post would be an overkill. The introduction and discussion sections are worth a read and point you to a good direction with links, if you want to dig more on the issue and for some reason still disagree.

Eric Horst Training Plan - for climbers that project less than 5.11/V4/6c - progress update TLDR: I followed [Eric Hörst’s Training Plan](https://trainingforclimbing.com/training-programs/) and now projecting V4.

Ok, well, I didn’t follow it to the letter, but it was a good guide to get me back in the gym. I stopped climbing seriously about 5 years ago where projecting V4/5 was about where I stopped. I got sober and climbing post pandemic has been my outlet. Now, I’m a much better climber even though I’m not as strong. 

I see a lot of posts asking for advice, and this is something that helped me. if you are just starting up again or for the first time, maybe this will be helpful for you. Just want to pass along.
How to stay disciplined into climbing softer? I'm injured at the moment, but well enough to climb, however I find that whenever I climb I overdo it a little, not seriously but enough to slow the healing. Does anyone know how I can improve my discipline? Or do I just buckle down and get it done?
Does practicing weighted carries (e.g pinch blocks) help with climbing? First off, apologies if this has been asked before - I tried searching several times here and in r/griptraining but couldn't find what I was looking for.

For training grip strength, especially pinches it seems, people recommend building weighted blocks for you to lifted off the ground, like tying weights to a 2x4 block and pinching that off the ground. 

My question is, how much does this translate to above-head holds? I think I've read in a few different places (including "Training for Climbing") that grip strength is very positionally specific. Not just pinch width, but also wrist orientation and shoulder angle (directly overhead vs angled away from body). Given how sensitive strengths seem to be to these positions, I'm curious how much / what exactly pinch blocks help with. Is holding a pinch block off the ground the functionally same thing as hanging off pinch blocks hanging from a bar? If I try doing straight arm lifts while pinching the blocks does that simulate pinching holds at different angles on the wall?

If pinch blocks are effective, could you use a similar idea for crimps?

This one [blog](http://en-eva-lopez.blogspot.com/2013/02/training-pinch-strength-for-climbing.html) was helpful / inspired this question.
Transitioning from bouldering to sport climbing After four years of only indoor bouldering I’m now transitioning to sport climbing. 
I‘m able to figure some things out on my own or with experienced friends (how to belay, how to check etc.)

I was able to immediately 5.10d (top rope), but I was confronted with a whole new set of problems.

Firstly: endurance! My forearms just said „goodbye“ mid route.
Which leads to the question: How do I climb more efficient with less burning? 
Which I personally would answer with: Better technique.

Can you folks tell me about good materials for developing my Sport-climbing skills? Books, YouTube-Channels, sites ? I’d like to research this more to become an efficient climber.

**Interesting Sayings:**

*"Bouldering is all about pulling as hard as possible. Sport climbing is all about pulling as little as absolutely necessary to do the move."* by dassieking

*"Take advantage of every good hold by resting. Even if you’re not tired, just shakeout, breathe, and rest. This is a great time to look at the nearby holds you can use for hands or feet - improves efficiency."* (I can't seem to find you anymore ._. )

*"Try to climb 4-5 moves and the stop, sink into your feet, straighten your arms, and breath. Rotate your grip to relieve the pump. Then progress."* by fourdoorshack

*"[...] Boulderers cannot relax their forearms while doing a move, while this is natural to the sportclimber. thats why some climb so "slow"."* groghnash's former teacher (who I guess would be [Josune Bereziartu, first female 8b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josune_Bereziartu) )

*"Something that personally helps me relax my grip, - and this is going to sound odd but hear me out - is looking down/away from what you’re holding"* - mrprock6


**Tips and tricks:**


- do Loops with an autobelay
- Hangboarding (could go with materials)
- hips on the wall
- get that trash footwork worked out (self-reminder)
- learn to rest mid route (example: climb 1min then rest OR 4-5 consecutive moves then rest)
- learn to spot resting positions, -spots
- climb more
- stiff shoes
- ”micro-” shakes of forearms while changing holds
On Hand Adjustments **Introduction:**

It seems every time someone comes into this sub and asks for feedback on a climb they’re trying, someone will chime in that readjusting hands is a waste of energy and that they should avoid doing that. In theory, this is almost certainly true. Spending more time under tension is more difficult, and any time spent adjusting is time not spent progressing through the climb. What I want to call into question with this thread, though, is whether telling climbers to try to not adjust is helpful in any meaningful way. My bias is that I think this is stupid advice. I think it’s the equivalent to saying “Climb better”. But I’m attempting to set aside this bias and try to navigate this topic somewhat “scientifically”.

My hypothesis: it’s not feasible to climb without making adjustments if you’re climbing anywhere near your limit, regardless of how dialed you have the climb and how good of a climber you are. Or, it’s at least not possible to do so consistently.

The way I aim to prove this, is to make a collection of climbers that I, and I think most other people, would agree are elite climbers. I’ve attempted to have a variety of climbers in terms of whether they’re considered more “skilled” (Dave Graham), or more “strong” (Alex Megos). It goes without saying, though, all of these climbers are both insanely skilled and insanely strong. Overall this list is somewhat arbitrary, so if you think you can find great instances of either lots, or very little adjusting to add, please do so.

With that selection of climbers, I’m going to pick 3 of their toughest ascents that I can find quality footage of. The reason I’m going for their top ascents is because I think this narrows climbs down to ones that the individual has rehearsed and has dialed, so as to avoid the idea that they are adjusting more because they’re unfamiliar with the climb, but also to avoid instances where they are significantly stronger than the climb, making it trivial to float between holds to give extra time to get perfect placements. I was going to include a bunch of routes, but decided to stick mostly with boulders, primarily because more footage is readily available, and it’s less legwork for me since there’s fewer moves to analyze. I did go through a few routes in this, though. I also tried to vary the styles of the climbs, and when easy, the rock types. Climbing granite edges is WAY different than compressing on overhanging sandstone.

For reference, I made an effort to not look at the actual footage/amount of adjusting before deciding to include the climb or not. Specifically, to account for my bias, if I came across any sequences that had significantly fewer adjustments than average, I included it, and tried to find more examples of that climber.

**The “Data”;**

What’s a Hand Move? A bit more complicated to define than it might seem. In general, I count it as a hand move if a completely different part of the hold was used. For large slopers this can be fuzzy, and I used my personal judgment. The videos are linked so you can do your own counts if you don’t trust me. Also, for most of the boulder problems I stopped counting once an easy topout was achieved. In general, these topouts wouldn’t be as rehearsed, and thus would make the counts a bit murky, i.e. the topout of Lucid Dreaming.

What’s an adjustment? Even less clear than what a hand move is. In general, I counted any episode of “bouncing” where the hold is unweighted and reweighted. I didn’t count multiple bounces in the same “episode” twice, but if bouncing stopped, a move was made, then more bouncing occurred, I counted it. I didn’t count rolling from half crimp to full crimp or vis versa when full tension is maintained on the hold throughout.

The list:

**Commentary:**

Dave is a self proclaimed “weak bastard” who is known for finding tech and tactics and alternate beta to work his way around physical cruxes. He looks like he’s floating at all times between every position. It’s honestly pretty insane. Despite all of this, he still adjusts on nearly half his hand moves.

**Adam Ondra**

* Adjustments: 10

Gioia

* https://youtu.be/QeR47AQ05Jo?t=461
* Hand Moves: 15
* Adjustments: 7

Commentary: Adam Ondra is widely considered the best rock climber ever. I found that the number of adjustments of Gioia was noteworthy. He does roll from half to full crimp on a few of the moves (not counted), but overall, his precision on this boulder was insane, for how small the holds are. On the other hand, I did find it a bit intriguing, that the first boulder problem on silence had so many little bounces and fiddling. It’s a relatively static problem, but Ondra seems to intentionally get the hold poorly in order to do a bounce to a good hand position multiple times.

&amp;#x200B;

**Alex Megos**

Lucid Dreaming (bottom)

* [https://youtu.be/EdMsY5st2J8](https://youtu.be/EdMsY5st2J8)

Story of Two Worlds

* [https://youtu.be/9nHbk-6FrCw](https://youtu.be/9nHbk-6FrCw)
* Hand Moves: 22
* Adjustments: 10, some very tiny 

Commentary: I think Lucid Dreaming is maybe the perfect example boulder for the No Adjustment camp on this topic. It’s few moves, between slick holds that you have to move powerfully to. Adjustments are almost certainly a serious issue on these holds. Interestingly we have footage of multiple climbers on it.

D Woods is an incredible rock climber. The actual biggest trend I'm noticing is that granite seem to allow for the least hand adjustments (interestingly, I'm personally terrible at granite climbing, so maybe I really should work precision some for these types of moves). D Wood's precision on The Process is absolutely insane. It is worth noticing though, that even after 50+ days work, he still is making some (very quick and efficient) hand adjustments on Return of the Sleepwalker.

&amp;#x200B;

**Results:**

All of the climbers I found (including those I didn't do full data collection on) make hand adjustments at least some of the time, if not often when working climbs at or near their limit. Surprisingly to me, Megos, who's often considered more strong and less technical, had some of the best performances in terms of hand adjustments, but that's likely due to the selection of climbs that I chose over the climber. 

It seems that if you're climbing on small slick granite edges, precision and hitting the hold right the first time matters, and that otherwise making adjustments is a completely normal part of climbing.

I do think it's notable that none of the climbs I found had adjustments on every move. So if you are someone who adjusts literally every single move, it may be worth looking at practicing precision moves, or not adjusting just to see if it helps. You may find easy technical gains by changing the assumption that regripping EVERY time is helping you. Or if you do it without thinking on every move, it's likely more of a habit than it is something that's helping you up the climb. 

On the flip side, if you're adjusting on less than \~50% of your moves, it's almost certainly not worth considering as something to use your time on for improvement, given that the best climbers in the world can't do much better.

I also think it's worth pointing out that all of these climbers are WAY BETTER at making these adjustments quickly and efficiently than the posts you see in this board. So I think "adjust less", isn't great advice, but "adjust faster, and more efficiently" might actually be helpful. My takeaway is that actually hitting the hold perfectly every time is insanely difficult to point of being pointless to train for. On other hand, it seems the pros know exactly how a hand position should feel and are able to very quickly adjust to get to that position, so it may be worth considering how to adjust better.

&amp;#x200B;

**Closing Thoughts:** 

I actually wanted to do a lot more analysis, but it was taking more time and energy than I was willing to give. I wanted to look at more climbers and check out a few other of the worlds hardest climbs like Charles Albert doing No Kpote Only and Nalle doing Burden of dreams. I also think Ravioli Biceps would be a super interesting case study given his high familiarity of the Moon Board. So if anyone wants to run the analysis and drop the info here I would appreciate it.

Does anyone have any different conclusions on my supplied data? Or better ideas for getting a dataset? What do you think of my conclusions? It sure is fishy that they match my bias, lol. Any personal experience with practicing precision or just adjusting less? Any anecdotes where regripping or not regripping was pivotal for sending something? (This is actually what spurred my initial thoughts, all of my hardest ascents have key moments where making a significant adjustment to get the hold "just right" seems to have made the difference in sending in a few sessions as opposed to many sessions. Additionally, I have no footage of me sending hard things without adjusting at least some). I'm interested to hear any thoughts, and hopefully this can steer tips away from people simply saying "adjust less" on this board, because I haven't found anything to support that being viable advice in the majority of cases.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; The pro's adjust often, even on long term projects (with only a few exceptions). Telling someone to work on "adjusting less" may not be productive.
Would these two stimulus contradict each other? Hi all, I've been watching Hooper's Beta video (link at the end) on Emil's hangboard routine and one of the thinks he suggests is to modify Emil's original plan for longer sub-maximal hangs to stimulate regeneration and soft-tissue health. 

That being said I was wondering if something like the following would work (from the finger strength point of view):

* Training days: High intensity training/loading, e.g. max-hangs, moonboarding, HIT, etc...
* Following days/rest days: Hooper's proposed healing hangs, i.e. 10 minutes period of open-handed + half-crimp sub-maximal (feet on the ground) hangs of longer duration (&gt;30s) twice a day with a &gt; 6 hours interval

It this really works, imho, it could be amazing to interleave those high intensity finger training with a healing routine that might help us to avoid creating pulley strains or overtraining.

However, I'm not really sure this would work since, from my dummy knowledge, fingers strength comes from mainly 3 sources:

1. Tendon thickness/cross-sectional area -- related to tendon hypertrophy (takes a long time to adapt, needs both moderate-high intensity and moderate volume)
2.  CNS capability to recruit fibers (quicker to adapt, where most of max-hang gains come from)
3. Tendon stiffness -- (quicker to adapt as shown in video, AFAIU to get stiff tendons you need to load them frequently with low-duration exercises, e.g. Emil's plan, Max-hangs, bouldering (?))

So, given (3.), I was wondering if the routine I was thinking about could generate opposing stimuli since training days would produce stiffer tendons but healing activities would generate stimulus to produce compliant tendons.

I'd love to hear more educated people's  thoughts on this. Also, feel free to correct me on any blunders or imprecisions I made regarding biology/training. Cheers!

Why do pro climbers never seem to sweat from their hands? Whenever I see videos of pro climbers, they always seem to have chalk left on their hands and fingers after many moves. I might be sweating more than the usual climber, but after a few moves, I personally don't have any chalk left on my hands (or fingers at least). Are they using antiperspirant solutions such as Antihydral to prevent this from happening or are they simply not sweating a lot from their hands? It might also be related to the environment they're climbing in (indoor, outdoor, humid or not, etc.), but it's genuinely bugging me. Has anyone else noticed this? Thanks.
Relocating For Climbing Hello all, 

&amp;#x200B;

Not a surprising topic or one that hasn't been discussed before but it is something that is always in the back of my mind (Should I move somewhere that has more climbing accessibility?). If you've seen Dave MacLeod's content then I'm sure you've heard him discuss how moving somewhere can have a huge impact on your climbing journey. For the last year I've been torn between the idea of moving to somewhere that allows me more access to rocks and a better facility. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to broach the subject topic and see if anyone had some personal experience with making such a decision. The regrets, joys, and woes you've had with your choice. I know crushers that became crushers with bad gyms, short seasons, and low quality rock but I'd love to hear from those who have truly adapted the pursuit of being a crusher so much so that they moved for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

(I know there's much more to life than climbing so please feel free to include anything)
Recently noticed many people don't understand where you clip from does not change fall length. Only how close to the ground you come. So I made a quick graphic.
3 months to train for a 10 day bouldering trip Leaving in bit over 3 months to Joe’s Valley for ~10 days. Considering doing a 12 week Lattice Lite plan but if anyone has any tips specific to the region (rock type, skin, conditions etc.) or how to structure the trip that would be great.

Been on a few short outdoor lead climbing trips and done a couple sessions on polished local boulders but this will be my first proper outdoor bouldering trip.

As for grades I’ve sent a few v8s indoors in my style (burly, slopers, heel/toe hooks etc.) but if it’s crimpy or board style climbing I’m closer to v6. Outdoor experience is over a year ago flashing a few v2-4s, did a long v5 in two parts in one session. 4 months ago I almost onsighted an 11a, flashed 10d, flailed up an 11c (I 90% boulder, 9% top rope, 1% lead for reference).

Mostly want to have fun but I’d be psyched to take down Great White v6 which seems in my style (and doable?) and hopefully be able to make moves on some harder stuff since I’ll be mostly with stronger climbers. Thanks
Stuck at V6, what training plan can I follow to improve? Hello! A bit of context, I (25f) have been climbing for around a year, with some ups and downs because of corona, mostly bouldering indoors. I go to the gym around 2-3 times at week for 2 hours and for the past two months I have felt really stuck on my level. I can do 6a quite flawless and have managed to do some 6b but the jump from 6b to 6c or 7 looks impossible. I keep on trying those routes for most of my climbing time to force me to get better but it gets quite frustrating when you don't reach the top week after week. I do also some strength training outside climbing (crossfit) to get more upper body and core strength. 
My climbing technique is quite nice and most of the times that I fall I feel it is my hands that cannot hold or grab the holds properly. So I think I am in a stage where I should probably include more finger training and hangboard, but it has being proved quite difficult to get a good training plan. It would be extremely helpful if any of you could recommend me any training program to follow! Thank you everyone.

Edit: I was talking about 6b to 6c/7 in Font grades no V grades, apologies for the misunderstanding.
Is power endurance a neglected resource? A while ago, I posted a link to our strength profiling tool http://prachner.silverside.at 

Data analysis shows some interesting patterns in the comparison of average sport climbers and boulderers. Average grades for the two groups are pretty equal with 7a+/7b for sport climbers and 7b for boulderers (p=0.1 MWU).
While expectedly boulderers are better in max. hangs and max. pull-ups, results in the other categories are striking. There is virtually no difference in min. edge hangs and max. hang time on 20mm. However, in 7/3 repeaters until failure the 7a+/7b boulderer is way inferior to the 7b sport climber with 99s to 122s (p=0.01), giving a ratio of repeaters to max. hang time of 2.4 for boulderers and 3.0 for sport climbers. 

In a quick research I found some statements going in the direction of theinitial question.

- Steve McClure considers power endurance as the biggest physical weakness also in sport climbers.
- Jon Procter from Lattice is stressing the importance of power endurance to perform consistently throughout a bouldering sessions.

It seems that power endurance work shows some room for improvement, especially for boulderers.
In addition, the common assumption that great finger strength automatically increases power endurance is a bit of a myth.

Favorite core strength exercises What do you do for core strength and how much has training core improved your climbing ?

Currently been working on my ab roller and L-sit, and I think that the for as long as I've been training it (2 months) I've definitely seen gains in my climbing ability. Maintaining tension on all boulders feels easier and more controlled because it just feels like I'm tensing at like 80% of my max now on hard boulders instead of like 90-95%.
Power endurance vs the moonboard Before the spring season I did a 2 month hard core moonboard training cycle and came out of it the strongest I've ever been and put down my hardest climb to date. (training dec-end of feb, climbed outdoors march-early April) Took some time off the board to have fun doing gym style boulders knowing it was too early to get back on the board and start prepping for the fall temps. I've started back on the board now and plan to do the same cycle but wondering if it's worth adding in some power endurance, and if I do how I would do so.

I've followed the philosophy where if your fingers are stronger, longer problems just won't take much effort but I'm also starting to feel I have moonboard endurance and I see significant drops in my power after about 5 or 6 moves.

Currently climbing through the v9-10 range on the board

goals for the fall are to climb 10 climbs around v10/11 and maybe shooting for a 12/13 if I achieve my first goal before the temps become unbearable

Has anyone found power endurance to be a limiting factor when using the board as their primary training tool? and if so what do you to train?
Library of all (face) climbing techniques, with links to tutorials. Let me know which techniques I forgot! I recently made [a video with all 86 climbing techniques I know](https://youtu.be/0keLRkd9fYw) (face climbing only).

What grades do you climb indoors vs on the moon/kilter board vs outside Just curious about the skill and strength transfer from indoor/board climbing to outdoors.
Tips for setting board climbs Just wondering how more of the seasoned veterans on this sub find setting their own board climbs.

Whether it’s with “hard” or “limit” problems, is there any routine you run through to make sure the problem fits the bill for the difficulty you need?

Thanks in advance!
Advice for climbing in extremely hot and humid gym with no AC Title basically says it all. The only gym that isn't 2.5 hours from me is a dinky gym in a warehouse that gets HOT. Today it was 87+ in the gym with 91% humidity and it hasn't even reached the "hot" season yet. 

Basically I am asking for help combating this. Slopers are straight SLICK and it's hard to even climb at your limit when your body is focused on that sorta heat.

Is there anything you'd recommend adjusting in my training to account for this?

Here are some of the things I have already modified:

Climbing early or later to get "cooler" temps.
Putting ice in my water (which I know normally is not recommended)
Choosing more crimpy incut climbs on the worst days
Taking longer breaks between climbs
On the hottest days do less climbing and more training as it is less taxing
Long-Term Planning a Return to V9+ After a Decade Off Background: I climbed for about 15 years and hit the V10 mark in about 2012, but was mostly a V8 kinda guy. Good times! Some injuries drove me away from climbing for a bit, and I got into competitive road cycling (also good times), and before I knew it, a decade went by. 

Since then I've climbed in short stints and gotten reasonably strong (maybe hitting the V5/V6 mark), but always get injured from overdoing it too quickly (sometimes my fussy right shoulder, sometimes my tired old fingers with weird lumps in them). In particular, my last two "runs" were halted from wanting to climb the Moonboard every session (I never got super strong, but was working my way through V4 benchmarks). I love that thing as a training tool, but recognize I'll need to work up to it (and that it's incredibly easy to abuse). 

So, yet again, I'm giving this a go. I'm 35. I'm about 5-7 lbs heavier than I was when climbing my strongest. I have a hangboard (Metolious Prime Rib), and can climb currently about 1-2 times a week (new baby). I live close to Squamish, and have easy access to weights.  I still ride about 6-10 hours a week. 

I've been intentionally taking it VERY easy on my hangboard (90% of my workouts my feet are on the ground, using that neat [no-hang protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBTI9qiH4UE&amp;t=275s&amp;ab_channel=EmilAbrahamsson), and I'll do some very easy repeaters once or twice a week). I have climbed twice in the past two weeks and still feel smooth, but obviously not especially strong (probably maxing out around V3, but haven't really pushed it).

My question is: how should I go about planning a return to hard bouldering that's as sustainable as it is effective? I'm willing to take a long view here (a year plus), and realize that it'll take a lot of time to regain the strength and ability I once had (if possible at all, but I'm convinced it is). Should I just focus on getting as many hours in of moderate climbing as possible, without an emphasis on training equipment/protocols? Should I slowly ramp up? Moonboard once a week? Moonboard never? Any specific weight training routines that you've found helpful for "mid 30s bouldering"? 

Every time I start to get strong again climbing, it's like meeting an old friend—it really is something. I'd love to keep that feeling going, and revisit some of the limits that inspired and fired me up so much in my prior days. 

All the best folks! Appreciate your responses in advance.
But... Training is Fun Reading through the just-climb/training debate, I noticed one of the argument frequently brought up against training goes something like this: "but why would you want to train? Hangboarding is boring" or something to that effect. As a V-noob climber, I don't exactly have the experience to discuss the intricacy of training protocols, but this particular point frustrate me since it is completely subjective.

I dabbled in a bit of strength/powerlifting training in recently years, and in case you are unfamiliar with the sport, powerlifting training is, at face value, exceedingly boring. You pretty much repeat the same 3 movements over and over again, for thousands of repetitions. In fact, one of most popular powerlifting program out there is called "Boring But Strong"! And yet, I and countless people enjoy powerlifting training because:

​
1) It's really straightforward and give you result
2) It's monotonous in a meditative, therapeutic kinda way --- boring is kinda the point
3) And most importantly, if you're a goal oriented analytical person like me, it give you the kind of measurable results that you can chuck in an excel spreadsheet.

If you are like me who is most motivated by seeing line in charts go up and to right, telling you to "just climb" and result will come without you even noticing is incredibly frustrating.

I suspect this is one of the reason (in addition to being impatient of course) climber so often gravitate toward training. The fact is that a well-defined structured hangboarding routine tick every boxes of a "SMART goal".

This fit into my broader issue with the "just climb have fun" argument, not that it is not applicable to the vast majority of climber, but that it is often apply as a one-size-fit-all advice that disregard their background, training history, goals or in this case their personalities.

I wish this community would come up with a safe and effective structured training routine instead of dismissing them as impatient clueless newbie. Some people just derive more satisfaction in seeing number goes up rather than the process and for people like us, training is fun.
Do heavy strong climber benefit the most from loosing mass? Just for a bit of context: I’m 6.3ft/190cm in hight, 107kg/235lbs and have background in powerlifting. Body fat is around 14%.
I have a 60kg two rep max pull up and can pin 40kg for 7 seconds on a 20mm edge. 
I’ve been bouldering on and off for about 7 years so I feel (although can always be improved) my technique on the wall is good. 
I feel my size is what holds me back.
With all this in mind would I or people like me see big/bigger benefits from loosing 10-15kg? More so than others?
Warming up on easy routes is a waste of time (according to C4HP) **Stop warming up on 5.7s! (if performance is your goal)**

I had a consultation with Tyler Nelson on C4HP about 2 months ago about a torn A2 pulley. He prescribed a rehab plan that spans ~16 weeks. The first 3 weeks involved very short sessions including only a "warmup", which has since gone on to be my warmup for every climbing day since, done prior to the rehab exercises for the day (usually on spray/campus/systems/hang boards). The warmup routine consists of various push/pull motions, some isometric, some eccentric, as well as the lower extremities (the specific routine is given at the end of this post).

I had been doing this in blind faith, not totally knowing the motivation behind it's design, but assuming that Tyler did.  After a full 8 weeks of adhering to the program (finger is getting a lot better), I stumbled upon a [TrainingBeta episode with Tyler discussing almost this exact warmup plan](https://www.trainingbeta.com/media/tyler-injury-prevention/), which he dubs an **IPP** or *Injury Prevention Protocol*. 

I highly recommend giving it a listen, but the tl;dr is: 

* Climbing finger injuries *do not* happen due to e.g. high-intensity but low-velocity loading on a fingerboard; the tissue is compromised *on the wall* when exposed to high volumes of rotational loading (grabbing and twisting), and high-velocity movements 

* Warming up with **easy climbs** exposes your body to more of this injury-prone motion, *without* activating much muscle recruitment, or even literally getting you warm (i.e. it is exposure with little gain)

* Strength training *does* stimulate heightened muscle recruitment, warms you up, all while minimizing unnecessary volume on the wall 

* Therefore, your warmup should consist of strength training

* Once this warmup is complete, you are *immediately* ready to start trying hard

* This should produce max performance while minimizing needed volume, and reducing injury risk

* The logic, and the specific warmup plan, is based on studies of youth soccer teams utilizing the [FIFA 11+ injury prevention warmup protocol](https://www.yrsa.ca/fifa-11.html), which shows that a strength-training-based warmup reduced injury risk by 30-50% for that sport. Tyler Speaks as if his plan should also deliver up to 50% risk reduction, though confirming that would obviously pend a real study.

The supported claim is than that, though we may not know why, structured strength training gives a higher injury-prevention response. Posts on the [C4HP instagram](https://www.instagram.com/c4hp/?hl=en) talk about this phenomenon a lot. My problem, which I didn't realize at the time leading up to my pulley injury, was **training power endurance pretty hard, at high volumes, without every having trained finger strength**. 

Here are some highlights from the TrainingBeta interview:

___________________________


&gt; **TYLER**: I see that one of the more helpful things that I do for my clients that have injuries is reduce how much time they're spending on the climbing wall. And that really comes from getting rid of a lot of the easy ramp of climbing that we do as part of our warm up routine.... 

&gt; I think most people would say, "spend more time on the climbing wall" makes sense, because they're emphasizing this practice of skill... But the skills can't be executed as well if you're not having as much of a warm up routine that has more muscular recruitment, that has more accentuated ranges of motion under load, that has more like change of direction, speed, et cetera. And so when it comes to a lot of climbers that have 7-10 years of climbing experience, they're not really warming up their tissues very well by doing this slow ramp of climbing because the intensity is really too low... 

&gt; ... one of the things that maybe we don't appreciate with easy, slow climbing, is it definitely still costs energy. But when we think about the return on our investment, if something is costing me energy, but it's not really getting me warmed up by getting more muscular recruitment or getting my blood flowing to my muscles better, then it's probably not that good of a use of our time... Anything below 50%, for the most part, is probably a waste of [our] time when it comes to practicing

&gt; Okay, [easy climbing] still has a stress, right? The climbing still has a stress because they're still grabbing on and twisting their fingers with a moderate amount of velocity.

&gt; ... science shows that *sport itself* is more risky in terms of the magnitude of the load, and the exposure of the load for getting injured. And so when it comes to reducing injury risk for youth athletes... climbing volume is more risky than anything. And so if we're having a practice that's 3 hours long and 75% of that we're on the wall doing things, the one thing that we could probably get rid of that's not really giving us anything back is all of that slow, easy climbing. Because like we mentioned, it's not the same thing as warming up, which is more appropriate in like 75% intensity range.


&gt; **NEELY**: Okay. So you created an IPP, an injury prevention program for youth climbers.

&gt; **TYLER**: Yeah. So essentially, like, I used the ideas of the concepts of the FIFA 11+. And obviously climbing is very specific. So to warm up the upper extremity, we want to warm up the pulling movement. We want to warm up the pushing movement. We want to warm up compression or a deduction at the shoulder. We want to warm up external and internal rotation, and we want to also warm up the lower extremity.... And so most of the movements that I organized was if you're doing something for your upper extremity, like doing a 90 deg, let's say for 7 seconds on 3 seconds off times three reps on a pull up bar. As soon as you come off the bar, you're going to do something for your lower extremity during the rest period... And then after the third circuit, they'll move to a finger focus warm up where they're doing, like, slow static fingerboarding

&gt; ... And so my thought process there is, after 30 minutes of that, athletes should be able to immediately go into climbing... with no extra climbing in the middle.

In reference to testing the protocol on youth climbers:

&gt; And so the coaches got familiar with it, and the athletes did too. But what was really cool, as soon as they were done, I said "okay, put your shoes on and go try your projects". And all of them are like, "oh, really? We're just going to start trying hard?". I said, "yeah, go try hard!". And a big percentage of them sent their project, or got to a high point. 

As you can see, the interview emphasizes youth climbers. But they do mention several times that it should be sensible to apply it more generally. In the podcast he goes into a lot more detail about the protocol, how to implement it outside when you don't have equipment, and detail about the FIFA research that inspired him. He also mentions what he think is the best tool to facilitate effective warmups outside: the [Flash Board](https://www.tensionclimbing.com/product/flash-board/). I'm sure some of you know about this; basically a [Metolius Light Rail](https://www.metoliusclimbing.com/light-rail.html) which conveniently is cylindrically shaped so it can also be used for pull ups, finger curls, whatever.

________

Also a quick note that this all seems to be a powerful counterargument to the "is training necessary?" debate on this sub, and the frequent calls on e.g. V5 climbers to "just climb, you don't need to do specific training yet". Skill-wise, that may be true. Maybe even strength-wise, that is true. But from an **injury-prevention perspective**, Tyler's work would suggest that this advice is questionable. You can totally tear a pulley by climbing V3-V5 at really high volume. 

This might be enabled by a belief that, "I don't need to train finger strength yet, since I'm not doing boulders that require me to pull *that* hard"... but as we saw above, this statement would be founded on the *incorrect* assumption that heavy loads and pulling hard is what causes injury. It's not! Excessive exposure to grabbing and twisting, and high-velocity movements (which are present in V3-V5 settings) cause injury, *not* slow, statically loaded but high-intensity hangs (which is present in fingerboard stength-training).

I believe that this confusion is a large contributor to my own injury. I thought that managing pump on sport projects was an entirely different matter than pulling hard on hard boulders, and so I favored constant endurance training over strength training, which put my fingers in a really compromising position.

______


And finally, here is the specific warmup routine that I've been using (this is slightly different than what is discussed in the podcast, as it sacrifices higher-velocity circuits for a safer rehabilitation, but it's very similar). I add ~4-5 minutes of running/biking/rowing on a machine first to get my heart rate up. This takes me just shy of **30 minutes** (obviously takes much longer the first time you try it). Rather than this protocol, I used to do at least 30 minutes of static stretching and then 5.7-5.9 autobelays in the gym, in my ignorance.

&gt; * Wide grip push-up isometric 7:3 x 5.  7s. at 90d, straight arm for 3s. repeat 5 times
&gt;   
&gt; * rear-foot elevated squat to 90-degrees x 10 / leg 
&gt;  
&gt; * 30mm hang at body weight. 7:3 x 4-5. 3 sets
&gt;

&gt;   
&gt; * 30mm hang at body weight. 7:3 x 4-5. 2 sets with 3-min rest between. 
&gt;  
&gt; *For the fingerboard warmup, more important than the load, is that you’re getting a bit of pump (fatigue) each set. That ensures you’re getting good recruitment. *After a few week, maybe two, of the warmup only try the climbing.

Thing is, I rarely see people doing these things at the gym. And I know a lot of people who warm up on easy routes. People I know in personally, redditors on this sub, commenters on MP... I'm sure there are opposing views to the stance laid out by Tyler. Does anyone know of any references? What do your warmup routines look like, and what was the motivation behind their designs, if you know?

Check your knots y'all

**Edit:** Some comments down there questioning Tyler Nelson's qualifications. I don't know much at all about higher education in medicine, so I won't comment. I only care about the *truth*! For what it's worth, HoopersBeta, the host of which apparently has a doctorate in PT, has a [video detailing a short warmup routine](https://youtu.be/T_-kvmqCzbs). Maybe he would disagree with the physiological mechanisms that Tyler claims have motivated the IPP design, I don't know. But in the end, his warmup is largely similar to what is presented in the OP: it consists of tendon gliding, some shoulder work with a resistance band, recruitment pulls (basically hangboarding), with an endorsement for some lower-extremity work via hiking and/or hamsrting curls. He doesn't explicitly say that easy climbing is a waste of time, but it's not present in his warmup.
Is the beastmaker 45° even a strength thing, or is is just completely condition dependent? Ive realised i can hang this hold for about 5 seconds, but im not particularly strong, so is it even impressive if i can hang this hold?
How are folks balancing hangboarding and climbing ? Sport climbing 3x/ week, hoping to start incorporating some hangboarding to rehab a nagging pulley strain, while still climbing often. 

Any suggestions ?

Why do you think Ondra is better than Megos? no, this is not a fan boy/hate post. I'm interested in it from the theoretical/objective perspective. Both are at the absolute top of the game, crazy flexible etc. Megos is stronger on crimps and have more power over all, but Adam Ondra is still a level ahead Why do you think Ondra is still better then? What parts of his climbing makes him better?

Any skin tips for us glove-wearing chemists? This summer I'm starting a new job as essentially a chemist. This means I'll be wearing nitrile gloves for likely many hours per day. Does anyone have some experience or tips on how to stop your skin turning to mush everyday from this?

How does finger anatomy define your hangboarding mechanics? This might end up being drawn out, so bear with me.

I hangboard on a Beastmaker 1000. 

If I were to try and squeeze as much power out of a crimp on the 20mm lower edge, without wrapping my thumb, I pretty much end up hanging with all my weight concentrated on my DIP joint (with slight hyperextension), and very little weight being pulled through the tips of my fingers. Using this form, I think I can hang with an added 30+ lbs. This however, goes against what the strict half crimp form entails.

If I were to comply with that strict half crimp form, with no hyperextension at the DIP joint, I can't even even hang with my full body weight. 

Now my question is... 

Is this discrepancy due to my weakness (i.e. forearm muscles that deal with pulling down with the finger tips) or is it due to my finger anatomy (i.e. DIP joints that line up exactly with the edge of the 20mm pocket and hyperextend quite easily)? Or both?

-


This post by C4HP is what got me thinking about if it really is weakness or anatomy:

So here are some pictures to describe what I'm talking about:

1. ["perfect half crimp form, 20mm inside"](https://i.imgur.com/rePTX9r.jpg) (no DIP hyperextension, pressing with fingertips)
1. ["perfect half crimp form, 20mm outside"](https://i.imgur.com/f8cScBM.jpg) (same thing, perfect 90°)
1. ["max output" form, 20mm](https://i.imgur.com/MqH0qwF.jpg) (notice the middle 2 fingers riding up, hanging directly from the DIP joint, PIP joint still bent to pretty much 90°)
1. ["perfect half crimp form, 10mm"](https://i.imgur.com/8KKb8r2.jpg) (this one feels impossible to do with perfect form, and I'm pretty sure most times I've seen people do it, they've shown large amounts of DIP hyperextension as well)
1. ["max output" form, 10mm](https://i.imgur.com/nxo9JME.jpg) (tons of hyperextension, PIP still at 90° but sagging)
1. [a proposed solution, 30mm or whatever](https://i.imgur.com/HZS3Uf2.jpg) (makes hanging from the DIP joint much less obvious/comfortable, allows me to press into those fingertips) 

And here's a diagram explaining what I mean more technically: [diagram](https://i.imgur.com/vOqZoAy.jpg)


-


Is my "max output" half crimp just a full crimp? Am I very weak when pulling down with my finger tips, meaning I should start from the ground up and focus on perfect half crimp form? Is the length of my fingers and easy hyperextension at the DIP joint not a good match for the BM1000 20mm edge? Meaning I should try a larger edge that allows me to really pull through the full length of my fingers?

I think my problem in question is exactly what the C4HP post I added earlier is talking about. They mention using a 25mm edge for half crimping. So I'm assuming I get the same strength gains out of a 25mm edge as I can a 20mm edge, with the same program.

Help is much appreciated!

EDIT: So basically, "perfect form" is necessary. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/via0uy/how_does_finger_anatomy_define_your_hangboarding/ideow5r/

This comment was the best answer I found. Using the DIP joint basically makes it an almost passive hang and doesn't engage a massive part of the forearm. Get those fingertips involved
I Am Looking for General Advice on How To Train With an Irregular Schedule I work in food service, I have a different schedule every week. I have loved ones that I work my days and weeks around. I feel as though I have had great success so far with just making training happen when I can. 

Still I wanted to see how others in similar situations have adapted training to a shifting schedule. Especially with maintaining training plans!

I have never really carried a training plan to it's completion for this reason. How do you guys manage it? Lol.
Casual gym climber finally wanting to train I’ve been casually climbing (mostly indoors) for almost 8 years, mostly sticking to things in my style and just having fun. I’m wondering how I can start getting into training this late in the game? I can flash V5s in my style, but struggle on lower grades not in my style. Fear of injury is also a big blocker for me as I’ve suffered ankle, wrist and finger injuries, so I tend to stay away from risky climbs…

I don’t exercise at all outside of casual climbing. Any tips on where to begin?
First Principles Climbing I’m sure we have all had the experience of getting shut down repeatedly on a hard move only to watch another person come up and climb it with a different beta, and subsequently we send the problem with ease. 

After almost 10 years of climbing I still find myself still occasionally “missing” beta that in retrospect should have been obvious. And watching IFSC World Cup events, I see that even the best athletes in the world will routinely suffer from this same inability to properly read a problem. 

In these situations I often ask myself “how could I have thought about this move differently such that I could have worked out the beta myself?”. While I am certainly better at this “first principles” climbing than I was 10 years ago, I still find it difficult to generalize thinking about movement such that it can be applied to any type of movement.

Is this just an innate skill that can’t be developed? Or perhaps too abstract to systematically improve beyond experience? Is this really just a physics and biomechanics problem? Would love to hear if anyone feels they have been able to consciously develop a better way of consistently finding tricky beta.
This sub is really trending to super low quality content. Too many folks don’t read the FAQ, or google really basic things. Just my take and I’m leaving this sub.

Example: there are so many posts about “how often” should I hangboard (or moonboard) after climbing for two months. 

Just read the FAQ.
Anecdote of shoe choice. Aggressive wore through, couldn't get replacement. I've been bouldering in my flat cheap red chilli fusions and seeing massive results. For what I always considered a low quality shoe has actually made me stronger. My core strength and foot work is skyrocketing. I sent an outdoor 8 in these full of heels and toe hooks; they barely have a toe pad and is mostly leather. The more I climb in these the more I realise you may not need an expensive performance shoe. In fact, I'm getting far stronger on overhangs with flat shoes and really learning the importance of leg positioning. Trusting your feet and relying on shoe tech less is game changing. I can highly suggest others out there to try it. 

I don't plan on getting another set of expensive performance shoe as I've become better without them. 

Keen to hear other related stories. My goal is send some harder projs withouth "fancy" shoes. For reference I bought some Evolv Phantoms and sent some stuff in them but are too big, thus the reason why I've switched to the only other pair I had.

Visualization and Intuition Hi everyone! I want to start some conversations about different “soft skills” in climbing. What do I mean by soft skills? I mean technique, on and off the wall. I think these skills are often overlooked because of their immeasurability. I’d like to share my thoughts on practical ways to “mentally train”.

I think everybody knows that soft skills are important, but people don’t talk about concrete ways to improve them. It’s always something like, “focus on your footwork”, or “just climb more” which are vague and generally unhelpful to those who oppose these stances, because these directions aren’t structured. I say this as a person who “just climbs”. 

Visualization and Intuition are two soft skills that people talk about a lot. I think most of us understand what visualization is, the ability to imagine yourself on the wall. I would say that climbing intuition is the ability to fall with some understanding of what went wrong, and having ideas for the next try to address that.

\--------------------------

Anyways, what are ways to improve your visualization and intuition? Here are some ideas to start:

Firstly, **actually try to read the climb/move.** It’s far too often where you see (or do this yourself) someone start something and have no idea what they are doing, or completely botch the sequence resulting in a wasted attempt. After trying, think about your initial read. If you were successful, is there a better way? If you were not, conjecture on the reason why you fell and try to fix that for next time.

Secondly, **watch other people climb to see with curious/learning eyes.** Did they do the move/climb in a way that you didn’t expect? Could you tell if their beta was going to work or not before they went for a move? Did you see possible optimizations if they sent? Did you come up with possible alternatives if they fell? Do you think their beta will work for you? 

Thirdly, take suggestions from others. Sometimes we can be tunnel visioned and need tips from other people. Whether it be before the first try, or after 20 sessions, there is little harm in taking other people’s suggestions. **It’s not good if you are just taking their beta, doing it, and then considering it finished. Take the extra minute and think: Conceptually, why did this beta work/not work?**

Lastly, **try something new**. There are a lot of people that just bang their head against the wall, never making adjustments. Just falling the same way over and over again. Chances are, you are not being 100% efficient on whatever you are trying. Have you considered all possible sequences? All possible ways to hold every hold? All possible knee/hip orientations? Have you optimized all other previous moves?

As an overarching theme, allow yourself to **be vulnerable to being incorrect or proven wrong**. In your head, make a plan for the climb/move you are about to try. If you succeed, great! If you are wrong, you have a great opportunity to improve your understanding of movement.

What are your thoughts?
Bayesian inference of the climbing grade scale For those of you that like equations here is a fresh preprint (not yet peer reviewed scientific paper) that might settle some cross grading systems debates of difficulty

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08140](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08140)
Made a website for keeping track of the hardest climbs Hi all,
I was disappointed that there was no good overview of the hardest climbs in the world (a few existed but all were out of date) so I made one myself.

My goal was to have an easy overview of all climbs with first ascent along with repeats and videos (when available).

I created and launched the website in January this year and have been adding data to it whenever I came across new info (new climbs, repeats, video uploads) so that there is an always up-to-date place to find that information.

Hardest climbs is defined as V16 (8C+) and harder for bouldering and 9b (5.15b) for sport climbing. No trad, aid, ice, bigwalls etc (at least for now).

The website: https://www.hardestclimbs.com/

The data and code for the website is open source if anybody wants to contribute or do something else with the data: https://github.com/9cpluss/hardest-climbs

It’s not perfect but maybe a few people here will find it useful. Loads of links to videos to get psyched!

And please let me know if you spot a mistake or something I’ve missed.
Climbing headspace - 1 bad climb = no more headspace for the rest of the day. (trad) there are days where I can run up anything my grade and about 10a-10d, without any problems and strong headspace. Also willing to fall. But then there are days when I'm at the crag, do a climb, get shutdown, and can't finish the climb even if it's a 5.8 ending because my headspace is just ruined. This always lingers for the rest of the session and I can't even get up a 5.9 without shitting myself. It seems like if I get 1 bad climb, the rest of the day my headspace is gone. Is there a way to reset this? Anyone else feels this way?
One arm hang rotation prevention Anyone have some tips for training one arm lock off strength? I'm at a point where I can hang ~10 seconds on the 10mm edge with one hand, but at this point my limiting factor is the fact that I can't hold the shoulder/back engagement long enough to stop rotating off if I'm adding more than 5-10 pounds.
How to structure technique development for overhung deadpoints? After reviewing my climbing videos, I noticed I'm failing deadpoints a lot. Ultimately, it looks like I’m both bad at generating enough momentum for my deadpoint, and I’m also not great at gauging how *much* momentum I need to make deadpoints (especially for the medium distance ones from 0.7-1.2m), and I often lose tension in the feet when making them (though this may be an issue of momentum generation rather then tension).

Have been thinking about what exercises I should be using to actively develop this weakness, and I've come up with the following activities:

* Practice the 3 main deadpoint techniques on overhang spray walls (pendulum, corkscrew, knee throw)
* Develop intuition for deadpoint accuracy by climb more overhung deadpoint dependent routes with active visualization. Before making a deadpoint, make a note of how far to go, generate momentum with the intention of moving that distance, and notice when the estimation is off.

Wanted to see if there's anything I'm missing/any feedback on the drills I've outlined.
Lightweight Hangboarding During Elbow Rehab This is a bit weird, so stick with me.

I'm sure most people here are familiar with [Emil Abrahamsson's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBTI9qiH4UE) on lightweight fingerboarding/hangboarding, but there's the link if you're not.

&amp;#x200B;

I picked climbing back up 6 months ago, and ended up giving myself an overuse injury due to excessive locking off (thinking that climbing statically was the best way to improve rapidly). I gave myself medial epicondylosis. I'm currently going through rehab for it. I've been seeing improvement with rest and rehab, and I was wondering what others may think of the above protocol of very lightweight hangboarding (as low as 50% BW hangs) for supplementation throughout this rehab process.   


One thing to note is that many rehab protocols involve high-volume, low-intensity exercises which is exactly what that protocol does. Most hangboard info on this sub is focused on high-intensity work such as repeaters and max hangs, so I wondered others' thoughts on this.
Boulderer stuck at 12 moves, not seeing improvements in training on ropes I'm primarily a boulderer and have relatively strong fingers (140% bodyweight on 20mm at 10 sec), good at static climbing, body positioning, and using heels. However I am gassing out on my projects that are more than 12 moves. I have tried to pick up rope climbing and saw a little jump in endurance but I am still not breezing through those boulders that have 18-20 moves.   


I read Eva Lopez's papers on aerobic protocols but my understanding is boulderers need to train anaerobic. I haven't seen a lot of protocols laid out so I'm looking for some help on figuring out what I need to do. I climb 3-4x a week or 2x a week if I go outside on the weekends. I want to get so power enduranced that I can flash my 20 move projects. Is the solution just 4x4s and 7:3s? What else can I do? Or am I not even on the right track?
Working routes on lead I have a really hard time with working cruxes on lead.  


I am convinced that this is one of the things that really good climbers can do very very well that is hard to see but gives them a huge advantage over time.

I find i really struggle shifting gears from sitting in my harness on the rope to fully committing to a hard section of climbing in order to work it out.

It's like a psychological thing. I'm great at high effort on sights from the ground but once I've fallen or rested on the rope I get confidence issues on lead. It's like I can't shift gears mentally fast enough.

Has anyone worked through this kind of thing and has any advice beyond just do it more?

Edit: for context I've been climbing 10+ years and am finding this is massively holding me back pushing through the 5.13 grades.

&amp;#x200B;
Takeaways from Coaching: A Milyoo Post i used to post here quite a bit.  i wanted to help foster a space for community driven/emergent training ideas that weren't always-already tethered to this or that training commodity.  a place where climbers could groupthink their way into big sending Valhalla.  good times were had, but I stopped posting after I started coaching a kids team full time. needless to say, five years and dozens of athletes (including a few national qualifiers) radically altered my thoughts on training/skill acquisition. i always meant to come back and give an update on what i considered "essential" practice, but just never got around to it. i'm free at the moment so here goes:

1) (edited to reflect elaboration in comments):

don't make a "lack of strength" your fundamental platform for understanding failure. problematizing climbing as a pure function of strength really messes with our ability to acquire movement skill. 

 of course, finger strength is paramount in the end, but if you can't position yourself properly then you're only cashing in on a fraction of it's possible value. footwork, hip movement (hip slide), and general precision are paramount to climbing success. weaponize your weakness before diving headlong into the strength game.

2) climb everything. spending all your time projecting things that suit your style can be rewarding, but getting good at everything really opens up your skill ceiling. it also opens up crags. cherry-picking things to avoid failure makes the guidebook feel more like a pamphlet.

3) non-climbing training is fine, but never to the point of recovery holes or injury. the risk/reward for the whole lifting game seems more risky then not. solid hollowbody. 5 second front lever. BW bench press. 2x BW deadlift. these are more than enough. that said, my best athletes (and several accomplished friends) never ventured beyond body weight exercises. i think we sometimes feel like we just need "one more thing" for everything to snap into place, but the truth is we often break ourselves through constant programmatic additions.  

4) if you only have time for one finger strength training: small edge. it's pretty rough on the joints but it is more game specific than weighted hangs on medium edges. it also makes bad holds outside seem usable. the subtle increase in perceived possibility is more important than any diet/training hack. i can't count the times i've seen a bunch of kids struggle with something, one kid almost sends, and then they all immediately run a train on it. belief carries hard.

5) the worst things about climbing are found in the way it (temporarily) rewards poor dietary habits. eat to feel great and accept your climbing ceiling. grooving your food intake around climbing isn't sustainable or fun and can have lasting physical/psychological consequences.  

6) find another hobby/interest. organizing your life around climbing is a tenuous gambit. the probability for injury is practically 100% so it's best to have a backup plan when your season dies because a tendon failed to accommodate your desire.  

finally: i don't really climb anymore as the concomitant finger stiffness messes up my ability to play guitar and pew pew people in Tarkov. i feel like the time away from the obsession has given me some useful perspective on the whole thing....

have fun hanging out with your friends in the woods. i never ever think about hard climbs i did or the methodologies used to get there. In the rear view all I see are the good times spent in amazing locales. no need to create lack or suffering where there is none. sending comes and goes. just let it be and enjoy the view.
Climbing Soft Skills: Reflection and Visualization A lot of people talk about the "hard skills" of training like hanging from small edges and lifting heavy stuff but not many people talk about the "soft skills" i.e. sequencing, positioning, self talk, and so on.  I wanted to maybe start a series about these soft skills and how different people approach them. 

For what may be the first in this series I wanted to discuss reflection and visualization. This isn't as simple as knowing the hand and foot moves. This is reliving the climb in real time. Feeling the holds on your hands, focusing on your breathing between moves, and also keeping your emotions in check. I am a coach of five years now and something we always tell my teams is "climbing is subtle". Being fully aware of your body and mind on a project before actually climbing it, in my opinion, is very useful. 

I have pretty bad send anxiety where I build up a fear of failure on serious redpoints. By doing this visualization process I kind of go through what should be on my mind and keeping my emotions in check in order to focus on the sequence and trying hard.

Do you ever think about climbing in this way, if so how? How could this be improved upon? How do you visualize your climbing and when do you do it? Do you think this is a useful skill and would you maybe use it?

A 5-year retrospective **Background:** Started climbing in 2017 as one of those meat-head gym boulderers (played ball and could dunk, loved lifting) to being now a lean chicken-legged climber (can now barely grab rim, don't know what to do in a weight room anymore). Highlights outdoors are V11 &amp; V10 in Font and 5x 5.13b/8a. I work a 9-5, have a gf, and try to have a life beyond climbing (and fail at it). Have been climbing 3x/week consistently for the past 5 years.

Spewing some thoughts on things I wish I knew or had when I first started climbing. My progression is average (?) so here goes a reflection for us mere mortals:

1. **I wish I built a deeper &amp; wider climbing movement vocabulary in my first two years.** As a taller +10 ape climber, of course I was being ultra dynamic, being overly reachy, and finding myself progressing on hard gym boulders and \**thinking\** I was becoming a better climber. I dug myself a 'vocab' hole where instead I should have been reclimbing the same things with drop-knees, alternative body positioning, and climbing with shorter-person/intended beta. Why? Because five years later, now there are outdoor boulders and routes where problems test this specific kind of vocab, where there simply is no shortcut for movements I always underindexed on. Having the reflexes, repetition, and the confidence from a wider movement vocabulary and knowing they were in my repertoire would have helped me a ton in every way. Same thing goes for shorter people - try re-doing the problem dynamically, or campus it, or grow taller, whatever. This is all to say: **re-climb stuff differently or in ways you detest - you're not training to send this dumb gym boulder in front of you, but for your future self who needs this 'vocab' of a movement to string together longer 'sentences'/sequences.**
2. **I wish I found stronger outdoor climbing partners earlier on**. These people are everywhere if you look for them and you just need to not be shy and reach out (can I have your number?) to buddy up. And it is honestly a bit like dating as there's a fit-thing on whether they can be more than a one-time thing ;) Hit up the strong person next to you when you're both resting before a gym boulder burn. Offer a ride or to split gas or that you have a crashpad. The climbing community is generally awesome and open; I think Adam Ondra said it brings people of similar values together. Only recently did I find people way stronger than I am, and it's helped me push the grades, shave off excuses, and amp up my psych. Plus you get to go on more outdoor trips and project together and save time and skin on redpoint / send burns. **Climbing with stronger people would have helped me improve faster - in terms of illuminating beta, pushing my mental limits, and showing me what trying hard looked like. They're probably also better about safety than your avg. climber.**
3. **I wish I understood resting, clipping, and shaking strategies earlier on, which would have in turn then helped my bouldering and sport progression**. These took me forever to learn as a boulderer. If bouldering is all about maximizing power, flow, and focus in a few minutes and less, then sport climbing is all about optimizing and being energy efficient.... optimizing everything, from beta to rest/clip/shaking to chalking to positioning to feet to breathing to what your belayer is yelling at you (or not!). You can optimize the hell out of a hard sport route. I often think about approaching a hard route project like chiseling an ice block. It looks impossible and insane at the beginning, and by the end you know every hold extremely intimately, you know every body position and sound you make at the crux, and there's this lovely piece of art that you've finished at the end. **There's always something more to optimize on your project, and the little things you optimize add up to a send.**
4. One of the most important books I've read re: climbing is "The Inner Game of Tennis." I frankly don't even know the rules of tennis and have never played it. But the takeaways in it for me were gold: if you don't even believe that you can, why the f are you even trying to give it a redpoint burn? Kill your ego, kill your fear of failure, kill the gnawing little voice in the back of your head telling you your shoes aren't tight enough or that you are tired. The positivity self-talk "you got this" and inner head-game "don't give up" while pumped are key key key. You have to tap into that extra confidence reservoir. The moments I've been most in awe at the crag are when I see double digit boulderers + 5.14 climbers get into their flow, and you know inside they're just having these big mental dialogues with themselves where they truly believe - and send. **Learn to kill the voice of failure inside you and let your body take over. Body intuition is incredibly underrated - that's why the first go is always better than 2nd/3rd :)**
5. **I wish I took up board climbing earlier.** I've climbed in many different countries and my take is that setting has ubiquitously turned more comp style and more 'appeal to the masses.' I wish I did more board climbing, earlier on, and avoided the urge to join in on friends at the hardest new set at the gym. It's amusing to parkour and double paddle dyno and then bathang finish, but board climbing has given me way more outsized returns. Board climbing trains high feet, deadpointing, lockoffs, latching, and just more realistic power moves that you'd see outdoors. **So the next time you're mindlessly gym bouldering (just another session) - ask yourself if any of these problems are truly expanding your outdoor climbing vocab, or if they imitate anything you'd remotely see outdoors.**
6. **I wish I had more structured climbing gym sessions.** For those that used to workout consistently pre-climbing, you probably had a 45-90min gym plan, with 3 sets per exercise, with a good idea of what you were training and targeting that day. You need to apply the same idea to climbing. Everywhere at my climbing gym I see people just mindlessly wandering between problems - and that's completely fine if they're casuals, analogous to the rando who would hit the weight room and only do bicep curls and leave - but to take climbing seriously means to know what the hell you're doing at the gym that day (limit bouldering? PE? ARC? volume? powery campusy stuff? climbing every V3? campusing that 5.10 overhang? finishing off that project?). **It's far too easy to just end up having another who's-the-alpha-session with the mates and see who can send that hard boulder first. But it's not easy to be disciplined and ARC for 40 minutes on a 5.11 autobelay.**
7. "Work on your footwork" doesn't mean just silent/sticky feet and being precise with them . It means using dropknees, hip positioning, flagging, high-stepping, matching, switching (and whatever other leg-related movements) to **drive the maximal or optimal amount of force into the toe/heel to ensure it stays there**. And so this becomes more than just footwork - it's about turning your hips, the distance between your pelvis and the wall, and having that tension in your posterior chain to move and stick your feet. Footwork isn't just ensuring your feet don't slip, its consciously driving and sticking your toes/heel wherever to take weight off your fingers. **And as handholds get more shite and the route more overhanging, footwork becomes that much more important in offsetting weight.** And on this note -- your hips are probably too tight. Once I loosened up my hips, my footwork became loads better. You need to stretch. It's like flossing. Only those that do it will get it.
8. **I wish I traded more climb-in-gym days for hangboard days**. I only started hangboarding a few seasons ago, and my climbing had an insanely noticeable difference pre/post when I came out of my winter months of non-stop hangboarding 2-3x / week where I became addicted to it. Being able to quantify and play around with numbers and exercises and seeing improvements is one of the best parts of hangboarding. On this note - I wish I did 1-arm hangs earlier (with negative weights or BW) instead of 2-arm hangs with more weight because of the bilateral deficit phenomenon. I also honestly also wish I read beastmaking earlier on instead of stitching together multiple hangboarding article/posts (and RCTM) to figure out my best hanging routines. **The best routine is the simplest one that you will keep returning to that doesn't feel like a chore. And have ones for different time lengths depending on how busy you are.**
9. **I wish I figured out earlier what was holding me back from training/climbing more and did something about it.** I quit my brutal braindead consulting job and was able to jump grades way faster. My landlord wouldn't let me drill holes in the wall for my hangboard so I bought a pulley and weights for my gym to hang there more consistently. I got my gf into climbing and now she's become a sport partner. Just like how you problem solve a boulder / route and try to crack it, you gotta be able to do the same troubleshooting with the factors/limitations in your life preventing you from progressing. Be it alcohol, bad nutrition, bad sleep, an existing injury, or no campus rungs at your gym... good news - you can do something about it.
10. I love climbing because it's such an intimate way to interact in and with nature. Surfing and snow sports are similar. But climbing is yearlong and more accessible for me. You bushwhack, you deal with the cold/heat, you get bit by little pests, you are full of dirt - all for the eternal moment or two or three of pure meditative flow. It's bliss and tranquility and solace all rolled up with the goodwill of climbers around you, and **I wish I had known there was such a fun and easy way to access this state earlier in my life. So for gym climbers reading this, refer to 2 &amp; 9 above and get out there!**

**\*Bonus for taller sport climbers\*:**

* Fight the instinct to clip right away when (1) its right within arm's reach and (2) before you find an optimal clipping position, which might mean even shaking out at or above bolt and then clipping
* We're taller = we're heavier = it helps to climb faster because we're lugging around that much more weight with each granted inch. what helped me was knowing when to go slow and careful, and knowing when i could blitz through at a reasonable pace. everyone does this, but being taller it helped me especially to "carry the cargo" with a pace
* Drop-knees are your best friend! I once climbed with Kai Lightner and it was simply amazing to see how he jammed that into his box everywhere. it will help take the load off your upper body and help you be energy efficient. climbing in a tall box also means very creative clip/rest positions that can either save or waste a lot of energy
* Max reach/extension is not always a good thing. Using intermediaries and not doing max reach &amp; not skipping holds proved to be helpful for me, as it conserved energy. dynos across a crux is thrilling and fun but not always energy-sustainable. similarly, being super extended means its harder for our lanky arms to generate force at their extremities, compared to t-rex arm'd shorties, which break you down over the course of a climb.
* We can always use more hip mobility. frog position is your best friend. need to be able to high-feet outdoors as we practically don't while indoor bouldering.
* Knowing how to do each move individually is very different from linking every crux. immediately you now need to deal with: resting positions/rhythm, clipping positions/strategy, and knowing which gear to go into (and when). If you're the only tall climber at the crag, it's tougher as shorter climbers can't be immediate sounding boards.
Another Retrospective Post: Things I've learned about climbing over 13 years that have nothing to do with gravity A few people requested that I write something up following /u/treentp's [fantastic post](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/vx55uz/a_5year_retrospective/) about his 5 year retrospective so I figured I'd give a crack at it. Mine won't me be formatted in the "things I wish I'd learned" manner so much as it will be me musing on different thoughts about what climbing hard even means. Retrospectively, my climbing focus over the years can be divided by the 3 major focuses of climbing. The first few years were all about technique, the middle years about strength, and these most recent years have all been about the mental side of things.

Or, the way I prefer it because it's one of the best pieces of media of all time and you can come at me if you disagree; "Avatar: The Last Airbender" style! Book 1: Technique, Book 2: Strength, Book 3: Mind.

This little retrospective is 100% Book 3.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** I started climbing at 19 in Fall 2009 during my freshman year of college and instantly fell in love with it. I had never played sports as a kid and had no athletic background. I'd never trained for anything before or been a part of a team. My main "activity" was playing video games. I ate garbage food, but fortunately I was young and had pretty good genetics (and there's this weird phenomenon where gamers have a tendency to under-eat because they're too absorbed in playing the game to consume food) so I was quite lean. Over a 13 year climbing career I've managed to climb one 14a, 3 13d's 3 13c's, and around 40 13a's and b's. I'd have to look up my bouldering stats, but it's something in the neighborhood of 4 V10's, 20 V9's, and 40ish V8's.

I consider myself average for a climber that has been climbing for as long as I have, that has also always been interested in progression. I know A LOT of climbers that have climbed for far less time than I have that have climbed harder, and I also know a lot that have climbed for longer that have climbed less hard. The number one reason I'm not stronger is because, frankly, I haven't put in the effort needed to get stronger faster. I 100% own that. A lot of people work harder than me and I'm not gonna insult them by pretending that this is about some Hare vs Tortoise shit. Nah. I'm not where I need to be mentally to devote myself to what it would take to get physically stronger at a faster rate. But I've been there in the past and maybe one day I'll be there again. I don't mind waiting. Which leads me to my first point...

&amp;#x200B;

**Stick Around**  
I only ever climbed moderately hard because I stuck with it. And I only stuck with it because I allowed myself to take breaks when I needed to. If you're not psyched on climbing the best way to ensure you don't stick around is to force it to the point when you've sucked all the joy out of climbing and you begin to resent it. You ever notice how many setters don't climb outdoors and only climb indoors when they're getting paid to do so? The saying may be "turn your passion into your job and you'll never work a day in your life" but from what I've seen it's more like "turn your passion into your job and it won't be your passion for very long" (caveat: I know a few setters that have been doing it for years and still climb all the time at a high level indoors and out. Exceptions to every rule and what not). That's not to say there aren't going to be times when you're not feeling it but you just need to show up anyway, grind through the bad times in anticipation of the good times. But learn to recognize the difference between general fatigue and burnout.

&amp;#x200B;

**You will never be the best**  
Western media has this nasty habit of convincing billions of people that the only thing standing between them and ultimate success is willpower. That's bullshit. No amount of willpower will compensate for the fact that someone else is training just as hard as you, for just as long as you, but they have financial resources you don't have. No amount of willpower will compensate for the fact that the other guy training just as hard as you has more favorable genetics for rock climbing than you do. You won't be the best so don't set yourself up for failure when you finally come to that realization yourself (give it time, you'll get there). Accept it now, and instead of training to be the best, train to be as good as you can be. Just because your maximum potential may not be THE maximum potential doesn't mean you shouldn't be proud of trying to achieve your personal maximum potential.

And on that note, don't put all your eggs into the "being a professional climber" basket either, because it's only *slightly* easier to achieve than being "the best". Unless you're social media savy, a guy climbing V15 will not be able to make any more than the most modest of dirtbag livings through rock climbing. If you want to make a living from climbing find a way to do it that doesn't rely on you being one of the strongest people on the planet.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pursue what gives you joy and ignore the haters**  
I took a lot of shit, from a lot of climbers I respected, for a lot of years because I have an 8a ticklist. I came up in the era of climbing where anything that even smelt like hubris was cause for excommunication from the climbing community. If you sent something you were expected to talk about how weak you are and how everyone else could definitely do it too and they will as soon as they try it. If you were proud of an achievement you better keep that shit to yourself because writing it down somewhere meant you were an attention-seeker looking for validation. And don't even think about pulling a camera out in front of other climbers. If you filmed yourself climbing your name had better be Chris Sharma because if not you can fuck right off with that attention-whoring. The crazy thing is that for years I thought that the climbers with this viewpoint were right. That feeling proud of my accomplishments and tracking my progress, or god forbid filming an attempt, was because I was inherently less spiritual, less zen, more concerned with my image than the love of climbing. It wasn't until many years later that I realized that the least zen thing you can do is judge lives you haven't lived. Whatever philosophy you live by, live by it yourself and don't hold others to your standards, pursue what gives you joy, and if people try to shame you for doing something you enjoy (I'm talking to all you speed climbers, moonboard masters, indoor comp climbers, dyno enthusiasts, basically any part of climbing that isn't considered "in") remember that things change. Ignore the haters.

**Eat your vegetables**  
I think it was u/CruxPadwell that introduced me to the notion of "Vegetable Boulders". The boulder problems you did as part of your training that you didn't like but they were good for you. If you want to be a *great* climber you need to be a *good* climber in every style. Remember Meiringin Boulder WC 2019? Adam Ondra demonstrated this point by easily flashing the final boulder, a crack climb, when nobody else could get up it. Don't let a V3 handjam exit sequence be the reason you didn't send your V13 dream boulder. Eat your vegetables, get competent in every style of climbing.

&amp;#x200B;

**There is more to life than climbing**  
Every climber figures this out eventually, one way or the other. For most climbers they will learn this after a devastating injury sidelines them for months or years, and in my experience most climbers (no matter how long they spent in the sport) won't come back to it after taking that kind of time off. Not only does rehabbing a major injury come with it's own laundry list of mental issues (will I ever be pain free again? What if I can't return to full strength?) but for many climbers who have tied their whole identities to being able to climb, the sudden inability to do so can cause an existential crisis that they aren't prepared for. Who am I without climbing? What am I worth if I can't do the one thing that makes me happy? Will my friends want to spend time with me outside of climbing? Do I want to spend time with them outside of climbing? Instead of answering these questions in a healthy way it's easier for many people to avoid ever answering them and instead just walk away from the sport.

The alternative to this is to answer these questions for yourself before you're forced to do so. Find another hobby. Have things in your life outside of climbing that gives you joy. Don't tie your self-worth to your athletic achievements. You aren't a climber. You're a person. Re-discover what that means. I know it's easy to think that the one-dimensional single-minded focus on climbing is the fastest way to climb harder, but what's the point of climbing hard if you won't be here in a few years? Unless your trying to speedrun a full climbing career then take the long view. Prioritize being a human first and a climber second.

&amp;#x200B;

**Destroy the ego**  
There is a reason human beings have developed an ego. It serves a lot of valuable purposes for survival, and the ego can be useful to help build up your sense of self worth. But if your self-worth is tied to your performance as a rock climber you're setting yourself up for a very narrow path to happiness. In order to be happy as an ego-driven climber who is only satisfied when they are the strongest one in the room that others are praising for sending, you'll have to continually be sending. You'll have to be stronger than everyone else for years, even as you keep getting older but the crushers keep getting younger.

More importantly, destroying the ego is a huge cheat-code for sending! There's this really weird phenomenon in climbing that I don't see discussed very often, but you'll hear really experienced climbers talk about occasionally, where in order to send at your absolute limit you have to want the send more than anything else, but simultaneously know that you have no need for it. Trying at your limit is really hard, and that's where wanting it comes in. Wanting it will drive you to push to your absolute max. But the fears and doubts creep in when something becomes essential, when it goes from a want to a need. When you *need* it you worry what might happen if you don't get it, and that fear becomes an impediment to performance. The best way to reach this state of mind where you are able to want to send with every fiber of your being but still truly not need it is to destroy the ego. If this grade, and this climb, truly mean nothing to your sense of self-worth then you can truly not need it. Having said all that, destroying the ego is a process. It's not something you'll just achieve and never have to worry about again, it's a constant battle.

&amp;#x200B;

**Weight Loss is a crutch**  
I spent *years* pursuing weight loss as a means to an end. And the reason I kept going back to it is because that shit works! At least when your perspective is limited to a few years. I sent my first 13a in 2012 after having lost 15 lbs in 3 weeks because I was depressed and not eating after a recent breakup. I didn't realize at the time how much those 15lbs had contributed to my send, but a few years later I read about dieting for climbing in the Rock Climbers Training Manual and I went on my first real climbing weight cut. I lost the weight in a more healthy way this time, down 15 lbs in 12 weeks, and once again climbed very hard. But when you lose a lot of weight while already being lean you put yourself at a bodyfat percentage that is very hard to sustain. I eventually found myself stressing over every excess calorie, depriving my body of necessary nutrients for fear of taking in more calories than I was burning and gaining fat. I started getting minor injuries more often and ultimately would be too mentally fatigued to carry on with the strict dieting needed to keep myself in single-digit body fat percentages (props to the people that eat healthy enough to maintain this year round, ya'll are better people than I am). Once the binging started I would inevitably gain back all the weight I'd lost and have to do another cut. Even though the weight loss continued to work, I started feeling like a failure when I wasn't at "sending weight", and it was harder and harder to enjoy myself climbing at heavier times because I would think "this would be easy at sending weight". When it was time to cut again and get back into sending weight things were great until I got injured again and then the thought was "this would be easy if I wasn't injured". I finally broke the vicious cycle when I decided to no longer do major cuts. If I could keep my bodyweight within a 6lb range without making crazy changes to my diet then that was the range I'd be in. For the record, that range is already very low for my height, 137-143lbs at 5'9". I don't really have a happy ending for this one, it's a work in progress and probably always will be. Even though I sent my first 14a at the high end of the weight range I still heard the voice in my head every time I pulled on: "this would be easy if you dropped 10lbs". Sometimes uncomfortable endings leave you with more to chew on.
How to kill your Ego? Hello, 

This is a follow-up post to the retrospective posted earlier (https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/vyeuab/another_retrospective_post_things_ive_learned/). 

TL/DR: One point that really stood out to me was „kill your Ego“. So my question is: How do you do it? 


For me personally, I know that my climbing training could be more effective if I spent more time actually concentrating on the process of climbing, learning moves and training weaknesses. But I also notice that this is difficult for me. I’ll sometimes worry about falling on easy problems, I don’t want to try jumpy problems in front of others because I know they’re not „my style“. I don’t want to run-it-out on lead climbs because I might get scared even if they are safe. I know that these thoughts aren’t helpful or rational but that doesn’t stop me from having them. I am really struggling with this and don’t know how to address the problem. 
So to anyone here who has dealt with this - How do you kill your Ego? Do you have particular habits, exercises or advice? 

Thanks!
Mental aspects to climb harder **Mental aspects to climb harder**

I got inspired by some recent posts about people's retrospectives in their climbing/training journey and wanted to add to this content. My main focus here is to talk about some great mental tricks that I believe help me thrive. They are not just about becoming a stronger climber but also a happy one.

**Background**

Since picking up bouldering some years ago it has taken over my life. I'm only a toddler in terms of climbing experience but bear with me through this post. I still (re)learn things from toddlers in the climbing gym.

Immediately before bouldering I didn't do any sports but I did high level gymnastics as a kid and as a teen I was well into dancing. I wasn't elite at these sports but more than adapt. I live in quite a flat country with no outdoor climbing but more than enough facilities to improve indoors.

I won't say anything about grades I climb, benchmarks on a hangboard etc. because this post is not about any of that and I want you guys to take away what's valuable to you and not think of this thing as either gospel or complete bullshit because of the grade I climb.

**Plateauing is a scam just to make clickbaity titles**

Do you either flash everything or are completely incapable to do a move ever? Didn't think so. Then in my opinion you're not on a plateau but you have the wrong definition of a plateau. **People say they are plateauing if they haven't seen a grade improvement in any style for a "long" time**. But if you can do a move first try this week that you couldn't do first time last week you have improved. Its just that in the higher end of the grading scale "mastering a new move" means "mastering a move that is very similar to one you have already done before" and not "Holy #&amp;@! I've never done anything like that in my life". This mindset goes beyond single moves. Can you link two moves? Can you do a move in fewer attempts than a similar move you have in the past? Can you do more moves on something at/above your current limit? **If the answer to any of these questions is 'Yes' then you're still improving.**

I constantly adopt this mindset and therefore I constantly feel like I am improving my climbing. **It's much easier and more fun to train / climb if you're improving and having fun.**

**Be curious, not just keen**

In Dave MacLeod's latest video he says that inherent to all athletes is the feeling that there is always something to improve. I believe what sets great athletes apart from the rest is that they want to know precisely what and then do something about it. I.e. they are curious because they want to know precisely what to improve and they are keen because they want to improve. From what I've seen most average climbers are only keen, some are curious, all elite climbers are both.

I remember an anecdote about Nathaniel Coleman where he and some others were trying a hard slab and no-one managed. All the others gave up but Nathaniel kept trying. At some point he was standing on a tiny foothold and just moving around his heels, hips, free leg, arms, etc. to feel the perfect position to move from. I don't remember if he did the slab but frankly, I don't care. What I take away from this is that one of the best climbers in the world was trying a slab in the gym because he wanted to know precisely why he couldn't do it and address it. The others walked away with "I need to improve my slab climbing".

Whenever I fail on a move or climb, I know I need to improve and I want to improve. **Figuring out precisely what to improve needs a lot of deliberate thought but is extremely rewarding**. I don't always do this because it is very taxing mentally. When I do, the immediate goal is always to do a move / climb properly as soon as possible. Therefore most of my time is spent trying to make minute beta changes so that I do better next time. **Only once I exhausted a lot of options do I allow myself to come to the conclusion that I can only do the move if I get a bit stronger.**  Note that "getting stronger" would often be a solution but it is a long term one. This doesn't fit my immediate goal of doing a climb as soon as possible.

**Try harder, be stubborn**

Most of the time **the key sticking doing a move / climb is simply "try harder"(**\*\*\*\*\***).** So why not try hard each time? I'm never disappointed when I can't do a move where I tried my absolute hardest on. I'm only disappointed if I couldn't do a move if I was holding back.(\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)

Also, why would you ever jump down from a climb just because it isn't feeling right? I've topped out loads of times after I got every handmove slightly wrong. Be stubborn: you can do the next move(\*\*\*\*\*).

\*\*\*\*\* BUT DON'T GET INJURED.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* This only applies to single limit moves or short boulder problems. I'm aware that sometimes you need to preserve energy for the next moves to come.

**Know when to turn it all off**

I'm incredibly hard on myself the seconds before and after a climb. The seconds before I prep myself to try extremely hard. The seconds after (if I didn't top) I'm hypercritical as to why I fell and what I should do next. During a (well rehearsed) climb I think of nothing besides maybe "Okay now relax" or "Okay now try hard". In all other moments **I'm just very happy that I'm doing an activity that I like with people that I like.** What grade I'm actually climbing or how I'm performing comes almost last. Ned Feehally once said: **I feel good climbing and I feel just a bit better when I'm climbing good.** Don't focus on the second part, focus on "I feel good climbing".

**Movement is the queen of climbing**

Like before, I feel good climbing. To me that means I feel good doing moves. When I can do more moves I feel a little bit better. So you might train with weights, the campus board, or a hangboard. **The hangbooard, campus board, etc. are a tool that allow you to do more moves. There is often a quicker way to unlock a move so that quicker way has priority.** I'm not saying I don't use these training tools. In fact, I do quite a lot. But I only started using them because I noticed I simply couldn't do very crimpy boulders with very very bad feet and some forced powerful cutloose. **If crimpy boulders are your style then hangboarding isn't the adequate method to maximise your movement vocabulary.** Don't get me wrong, you could increase your movement vocabulary in that way but you just wouldn't maximise it. If maximising is not your goal then knock yourself out on these tools. I'm sticking with my movement goals.

**Performaning all year makes you unhappy**

Have you ever heard of a runner who wants to do a marathon every weekend? Or a bodybuilder with a competition every month? How climbers want to perform at their limit all the time? Aside from being a sure fire way to get injured it becomes demotivating if you don't perform at your limit for a month. **We're not pro-athletes** so it's okay to take it easy once in a while. Have a beer, go to that party, take a non-climbing holiday. **If you absolutely cannot take it easy then you still have to stop performing at some point if you want to train.** Just for reference, my training weight is 5 kilos more than my performance weight. It's something I struggle with but I don't beat myself up about it. I'm training and that's simply how you train. My goal is to be a better climber than I was a year ago. Not to be a better climber than I was last week.

**Some other quotes**

*'If your dream doesn't scare you, dream bigger'* (Think I heard this on a lattice podcast)

This mainly applies to me personally. My motivation comes from my curiosity to see if I can achieve an ambitious goal. If I'm sure I can do it then my motivation goes away as it just becomes a grind. You might like the grind so maybe dream a bit smaller then.

*'If it was easy, it wouldn't be hard"*

I like a challenge. So not being able to do something is kind of the point.

'*People overestimate what they can do in five weeks and underestimate what they can do in five years*.' (Ned Feehally)

I'm in this for the long haul. A five week program isn't going to change my climbing dramatically. Five years worth of five week programs are. Again, I want to be a better climber than I was last year not last month.

*"You do you"*

This is what YouTuber home chef Adam Ragusea ends his videos with. The videos are full of tips and tricks and his take on things but he always says "you do you". I firmly believe in this. If you're changing your behaviour just because someone else is telling you to and not because you want to and think it might be a good idea I don't think you're going to stick to that behaviour for very long.
Dave MacLeod on 'how to boulder'. Some of the recent posts and retrospectives here have been great, and while I don't have any of my own to offer, I did find these two paragraphs from Dave's old blog to beautifully describe how important and beautiful the idea of movement within bouldering is.  


&gt;We call boulder problems ‘problems’ because it is primarily a problem solving activity (that idea of it being all about the physical is dissolving already!). So you have to come to it with the willingness to grapple with the problem - experiment, learn incrementally and then reach the solution. If you do it indoors then you inevitably run out of problems and need to set more yourself. So it’s also a problem setting discipline. A massive area of skill with lots of areas to go wrong. Learn it piece by piece.   
&gt;  
&gt;And what about the physical connection? First, you have to open yourself to the pleasure of movement. Not everyone is. They are too focused on getting to the top - the result, the task completion mentality. There is more to it. If the objective is not just to climb it but to climb it well, with minimum force. The experience has more dimensions this way. The application of strength and momentum is enjoyable too. But not just for the force - for the timing of the force and also the sparing of it.

From Dave MacLeod's blog post, [In Praise of Bouldering, 2nd of October 2010](https://davemacleod.blogspot.com/2010/10/in-praise-of-bouldering.html)
Takeaways from 5 months of getting coached or YARP: Yet Another Retrospective Post I figured I'd throw out my 2 cents from the perspective of an average climber (V5-6) who started training for the first time in February with coaching from /u/FishmansNips

Caveat emptor: I'm no crusher with years of experience and amazing insights. Just a gumby writing to organize and consolidate his thoughts

**Training sucks**: Training is training. Sending is sending. Expect fewer of those sweet sweet dopamine hits from sending whatever looks fun and embrace the suck for the gains.

**Divide and conquer**: Climbing is complex. Can you improve footwork, breathing, tension, fear of falling, movement precision, body awareness, etc all at the same time by just climbing with no particular area of focus?

**Submaximal volume still gets you stronger**: Sending below your Vmax feels unsatisfying, so you warm up and go straight to projecting Vmax session after session. That's like a weightlifter who warms up and then does nothing but 1 rep maxes every session.

**Repetition is key. Repetition is key. Repetition is key**: A send doesn't have to mean that you don't ever have to touch a problem again. That's like a musician who practices a piece until they can play the notes once to never play the piece again. Don't just jump from one sloppy send to another. Keep refining the movement.

**Climbing IQ is trainable**: Me dumb monkey, me fall, me repeat climb same way. Me do mental drills, me smart monkey, me fall, me think, me try climb different ways.

**Footage keeps you honest**: You can't really observe all your mistakes when you're so focused on climbing. Reviewing footage reveals the mistakes you can clean up.

**A coach helps offloads some tedium of training**: Yea you could buy and read Self-Coached Climber and Rock Climber's Training Manual and write a plan for yourself. Sticking to a training plan takes discipline already and adding all the planning on top of that... if you can afford a coach and offload that, why not?

**Logging your climbing helps you reflect**: I don't only put down what I did, but any passing thoughts I had: "huh I'm not breathing properly when I'm doing momentum movement drills", "I felt frustrated that I was the slowest in the group to climb a problem, although I performed well and sent a couple of problems that day". Just the act of writing down helps you remember those observations, prompts reflection, and identify areas for improvement.

**Hangboard is versatile**: It doesn't have to be for increasing finger strength only. Obvious, but I feel like that's what people focus on.

Warmup: progressively load your fingers consistently so they are ready to fire.

Rehab: progressively strengthen your pulley back.

Prehab: strengthen your tendons.

On training finger strength: Through only climbing, can you consistently provide your fingers the right volume &amp; intensity of stimulus to trigger adaptation and progressively overload that stimulus without overtraining or overreaching and injuring yourself throughout the years of your climbing career? Hangboarding is targeted (less time &amp; energy investment) &amp; consistent.
How to balance spray board climbing, system board climbing, and indoor climbing? right now I don’t have many opportunities to climb outdoors so I was wondering how much time I should be spending on each of these training tools to get strong for the outdoors? I climb around v4-v6 indoors project v6-8, v4-5 on the moon board, and v? on the spray board. A weakness of mine is technical coordination style moves, and my strength would be powerful body strength moves on good holds. Is there a benefit to climbing on the spray board over the moon board, or are they pretty much the same?
Anyone have videos of indoor boulderers who primarily 3 finger drag? Watched the Dave Macleod lattice assessment youtube video recently and was impressed how strong his 3 finger drag is. Personally my open hand climbing is significantly weaker than my crimping and I would like to bring this weakness up. I climb V6-7 indoors and am committing to climbing open hand only for a month or so in order to rest a mild A2 pulley strain. I can only climb about V3 and rarely a V4 if only utilizing 3 finger drag. Would love to see videos of boulders who primarily climb open hand for some motivation!
From lifting to climbing, tendon concerns? I recently started climbing but have been lifting weights for a couple of years. For reference I can do 20 pull-ups in under a minute, several reps of 40 lb. weighted pull-ups, several muscle-ups etc. 

I started climbing a week ago and have been breezing through all the V0s through V2s at the gym, can do most of the V3s and have attempted some V4s but get stuck at certain parts where I just don't have the technique. 

I have done some research about warning new climbers not to advance fast up the higher grades due to tendon concerns. 

Will my lifting background have strengthened my tendons enough so that this is not a concern? Or should I slow down and hold off on climbing higher grades and stick to the V0s - V3s? Any advice is helpful, thank you.
How do you manage rest during sessions of beta finding? So over the past few weeks, I've been spending a good portion of my climbing time on developing new rock. This has consequently meant that a lot of my limit bouldering days are spent doing more beta finding than attempting full sends. I've found it difficult to manage rests during the early stages of beta finding, when I'm trying individual moves and positions. While I haven't been injured as a result, I've felt that I'm losing energy quicker and have gotten some light tweaky feelings at the end of these sessions.

I'm usually pretty good at attempting a problem and then resting til I'm totally fresh, but it's tough when you aren't doing a single big effort and resting between them, but rather just messing around trying to figure out what moves work. How do you all approach managing load and fatigue during a session of beta finding near your limit?
How to translate bouldering strength into sport climbing? The classic quote “If you can’t do the moves, there’s nothing to endure” just doesn’t ring true for me. I boulder way harder than I sport climb. Max boulder send = V8, max sport redpoint = 5.12b. My main problem is getting pumped really quickly, even on terrain that should be ‘easy’ for me (5.11). I try to rest mid-route as much as possible, but struggle to get anything back when I’m pumped. How can I improve at sport climbing?

More TL;DR details in a comment below.
Haven't seen this posted here yet. For those of us that follow Dave Macleod, it may be interesting to see how wrong he was about his finger strength!
How heavy were you (roughly) during your hardest send/season? This is an interesting one. My strongest days are about a decade behind me, and I'm just getting back at it after MANY years off. I'm a bit heavier now, but not substantially. My hardest season I believe I was around 160lb. That weight was \*kinda\* heavy for me at the time.  (I'm about 165-168 now; I'm about 5"11). 

This all \*sorta\* ties into my long-term plans for building strength vs losing weight (I'm sure it'd be nice to lose a little weight, always), but really curious to hear where people were/are at during some of their peak periods.
BMI and Climbing Discussion I posted this as a response to the Matt Fultz comment in the 'How heavy were you at your hardest send thread'. Thought it would be a good conversation starter about thoughts in BMI as well. Posted in response to comment: 


&gt; "BMI is a flawed measure for many reasons but I guess what’s maybe even more flawed here is the assumption that the lower the bmi the better in climbing. If hard boulderers sit above 22 that doesn’t invalidate the use of BMI on its own but it does give weight to the concept that the strength part of the strength:weight ratio is more important than the weight part."


I  wouldn't say that using BMI is inherently flawed. Is it perfect? no.  But having a height-adjusted measure of bodyweight is valuable for  knowing where you lie in terms of body composition. This is not  suprisingly correlated with climbing performance: [https://latticetraining.com/2017/10/04/bmi-and-climbing/](https://latticetraining.com/2017/10/04/bmi-and-climbing/).

But  these correlations have variance, and so obviously some people will  fall farther from the trend line than others. This is true for other  aspects of climbing, like finger strength. No one is saying you have be X  BMI to climb Y, just like no one is saying that you need X amount of  finger strength to climb Y.

I'll  stop being pedantic because I think that everyone inherently understands  this and what people are interested in is: How strong is this  correlation (BMI to climbing grade? Is it stronger or weaker than the  correlation of other factors like finger strength, # of pull-ups,  flexibility, etc. I think that its up for debate but I think that some  people are being disingenuous by saying that the correlation is  extremely weak. The reason is obviously that weight loss and being  underweight are associated with eating disorders and telling someone to  work out super hard to get stronger is a much more 'correct' thing to  say than telling someone to lose weight.

I  think that if we disentangle the social taboos associated with BMI and  weight, we can see it as just another metric to optimize for climbing.  For some people, it will be something for which they are far off from  their grade's mean and so can be seen as a 'low-hanging fruit' for them.  Just like some people have exceedingly weak fingers or pulling strength  for their grade.
Crowdsource updates to the Wiki for "When should I start climbing-specific training?" The goal here would be to improve the wiki so that we can redirect most of the frequent questions back there. There are a bunch of "I've been climbing for a year, how do I get stronger" posts that one might direct here.

Current wiki version:

&gt; If you continue to steadily improve simply by climbing, then just keep climbing. You are a training novice, and the addition of supplemental exercises are unlikely to improve your rate of improvement. Climbers with under 1-2 years experience almost certainly fall into this category.

Suggested revision:

The best training program is the simplest one that continues to provide steady progress. For many climbers, particularly those who have under 1-2 years of experience, the foundation of that program will be simply climbing. A more structured approach than "just climb" can be helpful to accelerate progression. In particular, reserving structured time, often during first 30 minutes of a climbing session, on movement patterns and technique drills can be incredibly powerful, as can spending time deliberately climbing on varied terrain in varied styles. In particular, if there are styles of routes or problems you actively avoid because you "just aren't good at them", spend some time here "eating your vegetables" (and learning to like them) in addition to the time you might spend getting on the new set or working on projects in your strength. If you are primarily a gym climber, this can also be a good time to get outdoors. It is perfectly natural and expected that when you practice antistyle climbing or transition outdoors the grade you can climb will drop.

&gt; Note that general strength training is encouraged for climbers at any level. The shoulders, hips, knees, back, and abdominals deserve special attention, since they are critical to climbing effectively. When choosing exercises, devote additional attention to climbing "antagonists" -- essentially, pushing muscles. Maintain a healthy, strong, and balanced body and you will climb harder and ward off injury.

(this was at the end of the section, suggest moving it up &amp; revising)

Note that a general strength and mobility training program is encouraged for climbers at any level. The shoulders, wrists/forearms, hips, knees, back, and abdominals deserve special attention, since they are critical to climbing effectively and to preventing injury. When choosing exercises, devote attention to injury prevention (e.g., TRX Is, Ys and Ts) and "antagonist" training - exercises working the opposing muscles to the muscles climbing itself develops (e.g., wrist extensions and shoulder presses). Maintain a healthy, strong, and balanced body and you will climb harder and ward off injury.

&gt; Similarly, if you lack general physical fitness you should abstain from climbing-specific training. Build a strong physical foundation first.

Climbing-specific training (e.g., fingerboarding/hangboarding, campus training, limit bouldering) provides a powerful climbing-specific stimulus, but the stimulus either comes at a cost that one needs to trade off against climbing (e.g., hangboarding taxes recovery and may impede skill development from hard climbing), or has a risk to overload tendons and tissues that are not yet ready for the stimulus (especially for campus training).

&gt; Once you are physically fit and your climbing-only routine has ceased to provide results, it's time to introduce sport-specific training. Most climbers at this stage are advised to spend a few weeks acquainting themselves with the fingerboard, for which there are numerous protocols and progressions available on the web, in this wiki, and on this subreddit.

When your technique is strong, you can climb well in a variety of styles, and your progression slows it may be time to add tools like fingerboarding and board climbing. Please note that while progression early in your climbing is very rapid, progression after the first half year might be measured month over month -- this is perfectly natural. While there are many protocols and progressions available on the web, in this wiki, and on this subreddit, simpler is often better. Until you need advanced programs, a simple program of warming up on easier climbing, then recruiting the fingers with hangs in the 7-10 second range on a moderate edge with added weight as necessary working up to 2-3 max hangs, then completing the climbing session can produce very effective results.

As you progress in your training journey, remember that the best program is the one that you will actually do, that training adaptations are built over the long run, and that the vast majority of climbing training should be spent actually climbing.
Useful Tips for Someone Starting Their Moon Board Journey Hi Everyone,

I'm about to have my 2016 Moon Board complete and, for life reasons, it will be my main form of rock climbing for a while going forward. I wanted to get everyone's input on what sorts of things I should do/practices I should start to get the most out of the board. I'll be starting a fresh Moon Board account, so I was primarily trying to think of different types of problem lists I should create while working through all of the problems (like Good Warm Ups, Good AeroPow Problems, Good AnCap Problems, Felt Harder Than It Should Have, Hard-for-Me Cross Moves, etc.), but I'm open to other ideas too.

For background:
I've been climbing for over 10 years, have sent a few V8 boulders outside along with a few 5.13's, and will primarily be focusing on bouldering harder outside for the next while. I have climbed a decent amount on the 2016 Moon Board but it's been several years so I'm planning to start fresh with a new account. I'm also planning to throw on additional holds to have a pseudo spray board mixed in for variety.

Thanks!
The Ultimate Guide to Climbing Skin Care (or, A Beginner's Guide to Skin Care and Management) Lattice Training recently released a new video on their [Ultimate Guide to Climbing Skin Care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHtQrfeE4cE). I like having things written down, so I made notes of the relevant information from the video (and some of the comments made by others) and thought I'd share it here. I figured this would also serve as a good resource for those searching the sub for tips on managing their skin in the future, as it covers a pretty wide range of topics relating to skin care and management. Feel free to drop your skin care tips in the comments too if you feel there is something else worth mentioning here, I'm happy to continually edit and expand this post.

# Skin Care

Skin condition and care could be an underrated performance factors in climbing. The easiest way to think about this is to consider if you'd feel confident trying hard on a limit project wearing climbing shoes with holes and thin rubber, with wet shoes? Likely not, so the same should apply to skin.

# Managing Sweaty/Wet Skin

**Managing sweaty skin with drying agents and products**

* Drying agents are the most effective tactic for managing sweaty skin. There is a huge range of variance in these products and something that might work for others mightn't work for you. You'll need to try different products to find the one that is best for you.
* Lighter products will have a lower Methenamine content, whereas heavier (stronger) products will have a higher amount. Start at the lower end and work up to a product that suits your skin.
* Avoid placing these products on the creases in your skin (ie. the underside of your knuckles) as it can easily lead to splits in your skin.
* These products take 4-7 days to have a measurable effect on your skin. Do not expect to begin using them and see immediate results.
* If you are actively using these types of products ensure that you stay on top of sanding and keeping your skin smooth (removing yellow, hard skin) or you will end up with more issues with shedding and splits.
* Rhino Skin products are "rub in" products that come in vary degrees of intensity or strength, whereas antihydral is a much more intense "wash off" item that you should be cautious of using when beginning to experiment.

**Managing sweaty skin at the crag or while climbing**

* Fans, or a strong wind will work well to keep the skin on your hands cool and avoid sweating.
* Longer rests play a factor in ensuring that your skin cools and dries out between attempts. Longer rests will give your skin more time to cool.
* Looking at the weather, particularly the wind direction and humidity factors at a given time of day (ie. morning versus night) can make a difference to your skin conditions when climbing. Climbing with a favorable wind and lower humidity is going to be better for your conditions than the inverse.
* Experimenting with different types of chalk is worth playing with. Finer powdered chalks will feel better for those with wetter skin, whereas chunkier chalk will feel better for those with drier skin.
* Liquid chalk seems to be good for those with sweatier skin, particularly if used with powdered chalk. The alcohol in liquid chalk will also help cool the skin to prevent your skin sweating.
* Do not overdo the use of alcohol based liquid chalks. They will negatively impact the health of your skin.
* Consider the ingredients in liquid chalk, particularly look for 'pof' or tree resin, as this can leave residue on the rock and should be avoided outdoors.
* Chalks with drying agents could be worth experimenting with, but do be cautious of those with silica as an ingredient, as this is bad for your respiratory health. If you're climbing indoors a lot you could be breathing more of this than is advised.

# Managing Dry Skin

**General skin care and management**

* Moisturise and care for dry skin when not climbing. You want more malleability in your skin so that it can form to holds or rock.
* A recommended product is Flexitol's moisturising foot cream that you would put onto your hands before bed (not during the day).
* Fast absorbing (water based) moisturisers can be used throughout the day, whereas the slower absorbing products (usually oil based) tend to work best, but need to be applied before bed or at night.
* Products like O'Keefe's Working Hands is a good option for skin recovery that can be applied at night. This works well for splits around the fingers, at your cuticles or similar.

**Managing dry skin at the crag or while climbing**

* Products like Rhino Skin's 'spit' is good for preventing dry firing to increase moisture in the short term.
* A damp cloth or flannel will also achieve a similar result to products like this. Damp the cloth, and dab your hands onto the cloth and wait twenty seconds before applying chalk on top.

# Skin Protection and Taping

* Tape is the obvious first choice for managing splits and damaged skin.
* Pre-taping is often overlooked, as it can be used to prevent further damage to existing problems on your skin.
* If you know there is a sharp hold or rough rock on your boulder or route, pre-taping where your skin will make contact with that piece of rock is worthwhile.
* Tape down your finger (from the tip and then toward your hand). This ensures the tape is applied in the direction that it will experience friction from climbing.
* [Tom O'Halloran's video on taping your fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a02L_0Mvdbg) is a very solid 'how to' on taping damaged skin, flappers and splits.
* As a split or injury heals, ensure that dead skin is clipped or sanded off to promote and encourage healing of your skin.
* Keep your skin uniform by sanding, but also keep your skin conditioned by sanding between sessions (off days). Do not go overboard with this, but use it as a tool to help your skin grow faster, and to maintain condition.
* Rhino Skin products like split can help with healing splits, but other waxy products like the aforementioned Working Hands can help too. The idea is to keep the split moisturised and healing and should be applied overnight.

**The "Adam Ondra" skin care trick for toughening or hardening skin**

* Take a relatively blunt, sharp edged tool (like the side of a spoon, or the non cutting edge of a thicker knife) and rub it along the skin (almost massaging it) until the skin becomes sensitive. Do this before bed for 7-10 days. This should thicken your skin by essentially denaturing your skin protein.

As with anything, take the time to experiment and work out what works best for you. These are just starting points and should act as points for you to begin experimenting and testing out the best methods and approaches for managing your skin.
Clarification on half crimp I understand that the first image is an open grip and according to some people the second one is a half crimp since the first two joints are in line and the hand is bent at 90 degrees. But the third image is what I’m confused on. Is the third one also a half crimp or not since the second joint is higher than the ends of the fingers. And I understand the last image is a full crimp since the DIP is hyperextended and the thump is wrapped around the fingers. Any clarification would be greatly appreciated.
I’m offering to analyze any and all climbing! Hey guys, I’ve been coaching for over a decade, though I mostly coach competitive youth climbers, about a third of my clients are adults and climb all kinds of grades. I’m willing to offer a free look at any of your climbs, give you feed back :)

Again this is free so I will do it when I will be able to, and depending on how popular this gets I may not get to all of them. Two upvotes is popular for me.

If you want to send me a video, just DM me and we will go from there!

Edit 1: a couple people have Asked for my email and about my program. My email is trainonrock@gmail.com feel free to message me if anyone is interested in the program. It is tailored to your time and skill level. Other than that keep sending me videos!

Edit 2: This has gotten very popular. I will try and get to more DMs

But people have requested for you to post the videos here so everyone else can learn as well!

I also will be making a 2nd post that’s more in depth on how I analyze videos, and some of other tips later today. I will also be spending some more time getting to some videos, I have gotten a lot so I will do my best to get to a lot.

Edit 3: hey everyone so I never expected such a big response, I unfortunately don't have much more time to get to anymore, so I will try to look at the comments for some videos.
A request on what video analysis can look like for your climbing. Video analysis is an important tool that everyone should use in order to improve your climbing, some times just feeling something is off and trying to correct it is not enough, this is just another way to help you improve by having a 3rd person view.

1. Don't just film your "send" goes while it is good practice to do so, only filming the wins does not let you figure out why you failed.
2. You don't have to film 100% of the time but filming a lot helps, film the easy, hard, good, bad and ugly and compare them. this is also a good reference for when you are on a similar climb in the future and you fall you can go back and look at the other one and see what works.
3. when I am watching my clients film the main thing I look for is fluidity, so when I see hesitation, or lack of control I can see that is what needs to be addressed the most. so maybe they flowed through the first 3 moves but the fourth had just a slight hesitation which can lead to snow ball effect that can ultimately result in falling.
4. Four key things I watch in order are hips, feet, hands and eyes. Are the hips in the right place and are they moving the way they need to? could the feet be in a better spot, are they set in the right position? do the hands readjust to much, or is the movement to short? are the eyes watching both hands and feet all the way through? there many other things you can watch for but those are pretty big.

Edit 1: for recording and playing music at the same time on iphone [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/videomuse/id1473323567](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/videomuse/id1473323567)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: this is also not for everyone, but I find I climb the hard stuff better without music, I am able to listen to my body better whether its breathing or foot movements I just feel more in tune. I warm up with music but once I try hard I turn it off, maybe try it?
Climbers Elbow Rehabilitation Phase Guide - Long Post Warning - Seeking feedback Hi all,

I have put together a simplified, easy to self direct, generalized climbers elbow rehab plan.  Including key markers to move up or down the phases.  I felt current advice did not include issues with compression of the common flexor tendon or thoracic, shoulder and wrist issues resulting in poor loading habits.   I also included a return to sport pathway for exercise progression for climbers, again something which I felt was missing from current advice on reddit.  

This is just a quick first draft, I have yet to go through and improve the explanations etc.  but I thought I would gather any feedback re: confusion on descriptions, exercises etc.   This will go up on verticaljunkie next week sometime as another open and free resource for climbers in the future.   The document also has some pictures I couldn't put in here, albeit terribly drawn stick figure pictures.

Any questions too feel free to post I will try and clarify.

&amp;#x200B;

**Climbers Elbow Rehab Progressions**

&amp;#x200B;

For understanding of the physiology of climber’s elbow – please refer to the Tendinopathy discussion in “The Gym” section of Vertical Junkie.   This is more directly aimed at a general rehabilitation pathway to get you pain free and scaling vertical terrain!

&amp;#x200B;

**Guide to phase progression**

When you can complete a phase for 3 days under the following conditions, you can progress to the next phase.  

\-	Pain remains under a 3/10 for the duration of the session.

\-	Residual pain does not linger for &gt; 10 minutes post the session.

\-	Pain remains at 0 outside of activity when not performing a session.  (Except for occasional acute pain if performing an action, such as picking up an object awkwardly etc.)

Rehabilitation times can vary depending on the depth of the chronic injury and adherence.  If symptoms worsen, reduce the load, or move back a phase.  If condition continues to deteriorate seek medical advice and potentially a more accurate diagnosis or specific plan for you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Equipment**

Most equipment can be modified with household items for weight etc.  however, the below will make life easy.  The flexbar is a very useful piece of equipment which I recommend picking up or ordering.

\-	Flexbar (This is definitely an item you want to order, very useful tool and hard to replicate with home/gym equipment)

\-	Dumbells up to approx. 5kg.

\-	Broom or long bar.  Racking bar is too heavy, should only be a few kg at most.  We can use lever principles to make a fairly light bar apply the resistance we need.  

\-	Bar, Hangboard with jugs and rings are very useful for later phases

&amp;#x200B;

**Key Terminology**

Pronation – Means to turn the hand with palm facing down if holding the arm out, or palm facing away from you when the arm is bent such as when grabbing a climbing hold.  

Supination – the opposite of above, this is the position the hand is in when palm is facing up if holding the arm out, or the position of the hands doing a chin up (as opposed to a pull up).

Supine – Lying face up

Prone – Lying face down

&amp;#x200B;

**Phase 1**

First step in any rehab is to identify what lead you to this point in the first place.  For climbers’ elbow, it is most often a result of overuse.  This can be a volume and/or intensity issue but can also simply be a moderate volume of a new stimulus to which you haven’t yet build appropriate tolerance.   Then we have other factors such as mechanical issues (a lack of shoulder or thoracic mobility, poor shoulder control, wrist instability, valgus elbow forces etc).  

The first step is to identify so you can alter your training in the future and not have to read this document again!  The first week of rehab is relatively easy, long duration isometrics or slow concentric/eccentrics, so you will have plenty of time and motivation to put energy towards looking at your logs and working out what went wrong.  

A sit down with an experienced coach or PT can also help in this process.  

Description

Long Duration time under tension for your common flexor tendon.  We target both the pronator teres component and the finger/wrist flexor components of this common tendon.  Arm straight to reduce compression of the tendon at the elbow.  Build Weight and resistance so you pain stays under 3/10 yet goal is for exercise to be quite fatiguing by the end point.   As pain reduces you should be able to reach the point where fatigue limits at around the 45second to 60 second mark before discomfort.   

Durations

Initially perform once per day.  After 2-3 days, if symptoms are stable, perform twice per day at least 8 hours apart.  

Repeat each exercise 3 times. Each time a duration of approximately 45-60 seconds as the goal.  If pain onsets before this time, reduce load, increase rest.   If time runs out before pain onset and before fatigue, slightly increase the weight. 

Exercises

1.	Supinated Isometric Wrist Holds – Arm Straight.

Dumbbell or Appropriate weight.  I prefer clients to perform with arm in front to also provide some load to shoulder and kinetic chain, but if this is too fatiguing or limiting the exercise, can have arm straight out over a desk or chair with the wrist off the edge.

2.	Pronated Isometric Wrist Holds – Arm Straight

 Dumbbell or Appropriate weight

3.	Slow Hammer/Bar Rotations – Arm Straight

Start with hand in middle of broom, slowly rotating the Broom from Upright, to Flat with palm facing up, back to Upright.  Each rep should take 7-8 second.  Move the hand down the broom to increase load as tolerable.

4.	Slow Flexbar Wrist Flexion/Extensions – Arm Straight

Both hands on flexbar, slowly flexing and extending each wrist opposite directions twisting the flexbar. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Phase 2**

Description

Continue with the long duration loading, performing the same exercises as above, but adding in some compression at the elbow on the common flexor tendon by bending the arm.   

Duration

Perform twice per day at least 8 hours apart.  

Repeat each exercise 3 times. Each time a duration of approximately 45-60 seconds as the goal.  If pain onsets before this time, reduce load, increase rest.   If time runs out before pain onset and before fatigue, slightly increase the weight. 

Exercises

As per phase 1 – but performed at 90 degrees elbow flexion.  Ensure good control of the movements with the aim of performing while the arm is unsupported (not resting on a bench or desk).  

Exercises 1 and 2 add in some slow wrist flexion and extension to the movement to turn it from an isometric into concentric/eccentric workload.  

Exercise 3 and 4 remain the same with the added elbow bend. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Phase 3**

Description

Start to break up the long duration loading while introducing some more range of motion to the exercises, pushing into 120 degrees, bringing additional compression and further end of range pronation.  This is also the time to start addressing any issues with stability or range of motion deficits in the shoulder and upper thoracic which may be putting the elbow at a disadvantage during climbing loads.   

Duration

Once per day.  Refer to reps/explanations per exercise.   If performed without feeling like rest is required and no symptom limitation, increase the load of each exercise.  Goal is to reach a state of fatigue requiring 1-2 minutes rest with each exercise with no symptoms present.

Exercises

1.	Single arm lat pulldown with band or single cable row machine

Pull to approx.. 120 degrees elbow flexion.  Palms facing out – pronated position of hand (palm facing away) lockoff hold 5 seconds.

8 Slow and controlled reps including the lockoff.  To full extension, shoulder remains engaged with no pause at the top. 3 Sets.

2.	Supinated and Pronated Roll Ups Bent / Straight Arm

A broom or light bar with approx. 70cm string and weight attached.  Start with 1kg and increase weight to reach approx. 7-8/10 fatigue with nil pain.  Form to be maintained in a controlled fashion.

60 Seconds of spinning the bar to bring the weight up and lower down in a controlled fashion.  

Perform with palms facing up, rest and then perform palms facing down BENT arm.  Repeat to perform again each direction with STRAIGHT arms.  Totalling 4 reps of the exercise in various positions.

3.	Flexbar Over the top Pronations – Bent Arm

Start with palms both facing upwards, under the flexbar, bend the bar so it forms a sideways U shape, keeping one hand stationary.  Return to start position and repeat with the opposite hand.  5 controlled reps each direction.  3 Sets.

Additional Exericses for shoulder and thoracic restrictions.  

4.	Prone Shoulder Extension

Lying on the ground, face down.  Holding a light weight and lifting straight arms off the ground, hold for 20 seconds.  3 Reps. 

5.	Standing Thoracic Squats

Standing with feet 20cm from the wall and shoulder width apart.  Arms above head.  Squat as low as possible keeping arms up.  Move closer in to the wall until you can perform with toes touching.  10 Controlled Squats 2 Sets.

6.	Shoulder Internal Rotation TheraBand

2 Sets 20 Controlled Reps.

7.	Sidelying Thoracic Windmill

Can google this one 😊

Address any other deficiencies in shoulder mobility, strength, thoracic mobility etc feel free to add or remove depending on your circumstances.  Keep these exercises going through the next phases, focusing on what feels most limiting/weak.   Do some research and find more advanced versions to add in if required for mobility etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Phase 4**

Description

By this stage, client should be relatively pain free for most activities and climbing moderately with no symptoms.  If this is not the case, seek further advice and a more specific plan or diagnostic review.

Phase 4 is a return to sport specific loading of the shoulder and pronator/common flexor tendon complex.   

Duration

Once every 2-3 days.  Plan it on rest days from moderate climbing is OK.  Limit bouldering, board work can be transitioned back in during this phase.  Keeping volume low and sessions short.  

Exercises

1.	Wide Grip Assisted Power Pull ups

This is the first return to some power loading.  This one is very important final progression to sport specific loads.  Grab a band and a bar, use the band under your feet to give assistance and do 10 explosive pull ups trying to take as much weight off your hands at the top as possible.  3 Sets.

2.	Sloper Repeaters 

Moderately good sloper, can comfortably hang for &gt; 20 seconds.

Repeaters (Pick your poison re protocol, 7/3 \* 6, 10/5 \* 4 etc)  Plenty of rest between sets.  Goal is to get towards 7-8/10 fatigue each round, so use this as a guide for reps of each protocol rather than increasing weight, if you reach &gt; 90 seconds, find a slopier sloper 😉if this isn’t feasible, adding some weight can compensate.  

3.	Hanging Shoulder Shrug Progressions

Reps until 7-8/10 fatigue.  If &gt; 15 reps, progress to next progression.

Pick depending on your level on training / climbing history etc.

Hanging two arm shoulder shrugs – Bar or jugs

Hanging offset two arm shrugs (using one hand on a poor hold or fingers against the board to control any rotation)

Hanging one arm controlled shrug 

Hanging one arm controlled shrug tapping as high as possible above hold/board.

4.	Lying / Semi-lying One Arm Ring Pull Throughs 

Injured arm is holding the ring, although recommended to perform exercises both sides,

Can be done on a low bar (smith machine etc) in gym or a low overhanging hold in the gym, or TRX, low ring etc.    Adjust your body angle to make the exercise harder – increasing difficulty the more you are towards a full lying position.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting with a straight top arm, rotate your body upwards so the opposite arm touches as high as possible on strap ring is attached too.

&amp;#x200B;

Hand stays PRONATED – palm facing towards your feet.

&amp;#x200B;

Added progression is having opposite toe on the edge of a box or foam roller and the other flagging for amazing climbing specific tension / core exercise!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Phase 5 - not 100% finished yet, needs descriptions.**

Description

Intermediate climbers can usually return to sport with minimal maintenance at this point.  Assuming climbing and training conditions leading to climbers’ elbow have been identified and addressed.

More advanced climbers should add this additional phase 5 to compliment the additional demands limit bouldering and steep powerful sport routes place on the climber.   

Duration

Exercises should be worked into standard training days, as replacement exercises, not additional exercises (to mitigate further overtraining).

Exercises

&amp;#x200B;

Campus One Hand Bump Laddering with One foot on / (or off if high level climber).

Normal Width Grip Chin explosive pull ups, unassisted. 

One Arm Hanging Rotation Controls + Shrugs

One Arm Lock offs – Assisted + Progressions

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Recommendations**

Resume normal climbing following two weeks symptom free of the above.  Ensure any gaps in your shoulder strength, mobility, climbing specific tension and core relative to your climbing grades are brought up to par to reduce the increased load down the kinetic chain on your elbows and wrists.   

Happy climbing! 😊

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Notes:**

&amp;#x200B;

1.	Avoid multiple training types with narrow shoulder width grip positions (example, small hangboards, shoulder width chins, short campus rungs etc)  -  This causes excess stress on the pronator and the common flexor tendon at the elbow.  This is a great first step to reducing training impact on elbows.  

&amp;#x200B;

(This doesn’t mean NOT to train these positions, simply to not do all training in this range)

&amp;#x200B;

This could be as simple as aiming for the edge of a campus rung rather than closer to centre while campusing or avoiding climbs with close crossing or small crimp matching etc while elbows aren’t healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

2.	Training logs are not just amazing at keeping your training high quality and effective, but as a history check if you get any issues to try and investigate the why and how.  Highly recommend some form of logging.  Also helps a potential PT or coach identify issues in your training when asking for advice.

&amp;#x200B;

3.	Deep lock offs combined with explosive movements, commonly found on moonboard and other steep training boards, tend to cause more elbow issues.  These boards are amazing but listen to your body if doing multiple board sessions per week. 

&amp;#x200B;

4.	I said it above, but I will say it again, often times climbers elbow can be a result of a limitation or weakness in the thoracic region, shoulder or wrist.   Do a self check to make sure all of these are performing at the same level as your climbing, and if not, address those in your training!

&amp;#x200B;

5.	Be patient with recovery, tendinopathy is a slow burn rehab.  Doing it right alongside fixing the habits which created it might take a few months.  This is preferable to recurrent elbow issues season after season.

&amp;#x200B;

6.	Tendinopathy, not tendinitis.  TENDINOPATHY, NOT TENDINITISSSSSSS for fks sake…  well, in most cases at least.
How do you structure your indoor bouldering sessions for optimum progress? Hi there,

Some general info :

* Grade: \~v5/6c
* XP: 3.5 years
* Sessions (on average): 2 bouldering sessions per week, 1 max hangboard/nohang session per week
* Almost exclusively indoor bouldering, very occasionally outdoors
* My gym does not really do comp-style boulders

How should I be proceeding?

1. Should I be doing pyramids? Should this be done on climbs that have already been done? For example, try to accomplish: (**Vx** being max grade)
   1. Warm-up
   2. 4 boulders at **Vx-1** (these are usually a flash or take 1 session to complete)
   3. 2 boulders at **Vx** (usually 1-4 sessions to fail)
   4. 1 boulder at **Vx+1** (no sends, but can sometimes dial in all the moves without linking everything)
2. Are there other ways to structure your session?
3. What is the best way to progress? By progress, I mean reaching higher grades, and being able to climb in all styles.

I have been trying to stay structured but will often find myself either running from boulder to boulder (bad!) just to get sends or just projecting Vx+1 without ever sending.
Body tension as a skill Body tension is a very confusing thing for me. Even with a strong core, there is still a large "skill" portion of body tension. How do I balance staying tight vs staying loose through the hips to be able to move the lower body fluidly? These things often feel like opposites of each other, where it's hard to do both at once. Here's some questions i've had along these lines-

- What are some mental cues for body tension to think about on the wall?

- How tight is too tight, and how does this change with wall angle?

- What on-the-wall drills are recommended for working body tension?

- People like Daniel Woods and Katie Lamb stand out when it comes to body tension. What sets them apart, and what can we learn from their styles?
Motivation for those going through injuries Hi!

After 2 separate shoulder dislocations and 2 separate labral repair surgeries, half-half left arm right arm, followed by a year-ish long period of apprehensive sports and reinjury close calls, I am climbing stronger than ever (V5 whereas before injury I was only V4). 

Do your PT yes, but more importantly is what comes after. Get back into climbing SLOWLY. Work your way up to your previous level over a timespan of months at the least, years in some cases. It sucks, but its the only way to let your body's tendons and ligaments strengthen sufficiently as they meet the strains of climbing again. Also, make warming up a fact of life for you when it comes to any activity. No longer can you eschew the warm up in favor of a spontaneous flash to impress your friends. DO. IT. EVERY. TIME. 

The grueling process is worth it, I feel stronger than ever (almost 2 years after initial injury). If you're going through a tough injury right now, do PT diligently and find a hobby that can be done whilst sitting. It sucks but its better than pitying yourself!
Less common medial epicondylitis (golfer's elbow) success story I would like to share how I've finally overcome my medial epicondylitis after suffering for almost a year. I've been climbing for 14 years and do everything from bouldering to alpine.

Most of the advice and rehab protocols I could find were for flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) and/or pronator teres (PT) tendon damage.  According to Dr. Julian Saunders '[Dodgy elbows revisited](http://drjuliansaunders.com/ask-dr-j-issue-223-dodgy-elbows-revisited/)' these make up 95% of all medial epicondylitis cases. Mine however was in the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon and it took me 7 months to figure that out.

I first got it in my left elbow shortly after subluxating my left shoulder while bouldering. A few months later I got it in my right elbow as well. Naturally I ignored it at first. Then I tried to cure them with limit bouldering but surprisingly that made them worse.

Then I tried to rehab them with the advice I could find from Dave Mac's book 'Make or Break', Dr. Julian Saunders, Lattice and many more videos and articles. The elbows initially got a little better but then it stalled.

Finally I found that resisted flexion of my ring fingers at the DIP-joint really hit the pain bullseye. So it was the FDS-tendon that was damaged. There's an excellent 'test cluster' video in [this article](https://www.trainingbeta.com/medialepi/) for finding out which tendon(s)/muscle(s) that might be involved.

After that I started doing eccentrics targeting the FDS every other day *à la* 'Dodgy elbows revisited' and 3 months later the pain is completely gone in my left elbow and almost gone in my right. I targeted the tendon by crimping my middle and ring fingers on my hangboard and then extendning them under load into an open handed grip. This can also be done on a table, the steering wheel etc.

The pain did initially get a bit worse the first few weeks but then I saw steady improvements.

I also did the following:

* Apparantly my shoulders and upper back were horribly inflexible. According to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-mLKfDPS5U) from Lattice this is a common cause for elbow injuries (I've had many). My theory is that the shoulder subluxation and the reduced strength and range of motion afterwards expedited the onset in my left arm. I did [this 6-minute mobility program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_FkzgLHp0) daily and within two weeks my back and shoulders felt absolutely amazing. Now my mild case of climber's hunch is gone and I can use my back muscles much more efficiently.
* I bought an armaid device and used it several times per week (highly recommend).
* I kept climbing (every other day), but only on boulders/routes that I could do with straight arms all the way. I found that hard to do outdoors so I've been stuck in the gym. I kept increasing the volume every fourth sesssion in 5-10 problem increments. Usually a boulder session for me involves climbing 50-60 problems. Now I started with 10 problems per session and worked my way up to my regular volume. The upside of this is that I've seen some real improvements in my technique. I'm planning on holding this volume and start adding some more intense climbing after new years.
* I started hangboarding for the first time after I started my FDS rehab. Starting with 6"/4"-repeaters once a week. First one set of 6x 6"/4"-hangs and then slowly adding reps and sets. Now I do one session of 6"/4"-repeaters and one with 10"/5 repeaters. I did not experience any increase in pain after my sessions (I think they rather helped) and my fingers are a LOT stronger now.

I hope someone might find this useful. English is not my first language so please forgive any grammatical errors.

Edit: Spelling and added some background.
Using rowing as a training tool A few months ago, I did a search here about using rowing on rest days as cross training for climbing. Didn’t find clear consensus, but most people advised against it. The logic is that rowing use similar muscle group as climbing, especially the pulling part. I mainly want to add a little bit cardio on my rest days, so decided to give it a try. About one month ago, I bought a Concept 2 Erg, signed up 4 private lessons, took 3 so far, and has been rowing 2 sets of 7min on rest days. In the past  weeks, I see significant improvement on my climbing indoors. So posting, in case it helps others. 

I’ve been climbing 4 years, very static climber, tried really hard to be more dynamic, making slow progress. In the gym, before I started rowing, I consistently can send 5.11s on vert or slab, but any overhang kills me. Most of the lead routes in my gym are on slight to severe overhang walls. I could only TR a few 5.10s on the slight overhang walls, and can’t even do most of the moves on the cave wall. Just last two weeks, all of the sudden, I can lead most the 10s on the slight overhang, with only one 10+ on that wall that I need a take. On the cave wall, I can do all the moves and feel in a few more sessions I’ll give leading them a go. In two weeks I went from only be able to send 10-20% of 5.10s in the gym to 60-70% of them. My climbing partner’s performance on the same routes didn’t change much.

Mostly, I feel I can push with my leg with much more power, stronger core help me stay closer to the wall, and when I find a good position, I can shakeout more efficiently and recover faster. 

The rowing technique is quite specific. With only 3 lessons, I wanted to focus on form. And here’s the gist: 1. Explosive push with leg only, about 1/3 time of the full stroke; 2. With core engaged, snap back and pull fast with arm 1/6 time of full stroke; then extend arm while still have core engaged lean forward 1/6 time; 3. Bend leg, recover, 1/3 time of the full stroke. Repeat. The coach told me to target 20 to 22 strokes per minute, shoot for consistent split time for each stroke, row for 7min as one set. So within one set, I get to work on explosive kind of push for 140-150 times, which I think really helped make my moves more dynamic. 

TL:DR, rowing with right form helped me and may help other fellow static climbers be more dynamic.
Climbing harder by climbing more often Climbing volume is king; but how do I increase it?

As stated, Imo  sheer climbing volume and the amount of new moves, techniques, rock types and just overall experience climbing is what's needed to improve. At least in the first 5 or so years.
The question then becomes how do we increase this volume of climbing and optimise  training sessions?

For example, I  am a young climber who has quite a lot of free time  and regularly climb around 4 days a week outside on rock. My usual session consists of 1 or 2 warm up routes and then work on  1  or 2 projects. During the year I train in the gym with the local team and usually boulder 1 day and do circuits 2 days with 1 day of outdoor projecting.
I feel I'm  not getting enough volume in but feel  like working on things under my limit won't  necessarily  improve my climbing all that much.
Does anyone have any advice on what I could/should do in such a situation?

Hopefully this post can help both the climbing and community and myself to improve and push all our grades!
How to effectively train (lead) when partner has different objectives? I have been climbing for 2 years now and started ramping up training for the past 6 months, my objectives are more towards leading but i lead/boulder in a 50/50 split. I'm using the crimpd+ app and have been finding it super useful for someone like me, with no previous experience with structured training. 

The issue at hand is that I pretty much exclusively lead climb with my gf who is a few grades lower (6a). She has a chronic fear of heights and has been incredible in getting where she is but it also means we work on totally different routes and we have different priorities (for example if she is to have a successful session sometimes she needs to spend a lot of time on the wall to do a route in increments). In the training app there are a number of workouts which recommend specific amount of time on the wall and resting and I don't really know how to incorporate the needs of a climbing partner in such a training regimen.

Does anyone here have experience in aligning their training needs with those of your partner?
Timing of weight loss How do you time your cut and bulk micro cycles?

I used to be an absolute twig, like 6’2 and 130 lbs level twig. Over a few years, I slowly accumulated weight and now I’m at my “ideal” climbing weight at around 180 lbs. I feel healthy, I feel strong, and all that. 

However, my slow weight gain over the years wasn’t exactly the cleanest eating. I’ve accumulated a little more body fat that I would have wanted. I’m probably around 18% give or take. I don’t want to be absolutely shredded or anything and drop down to like 8% or anything crazy, but I feel like if I dropped to 12-14% it would beneficial… 

But how do I do that? The climbing season is fast approach, and I don’t really want to “gain” anymore weight, and I’ve also read cutting can lead to injury and there isn’t really much to “cut”. 

Has anyone been in this position before? What’s the way forward? If I just maintain calories and replace like toast in the morning with ham will I just maintain weight and replace some fat with muscle eventually?
Personal Lesson: The Weight of Entitlement I wanted to start giving back to climb harder with various lessons I come across as I continue my climbing journey. One of the biggest lessons that I have struggled with and still continue to struggle with is something I have best approximated as the "weight of entitlement".



Over the past couple years, I have began seriously training for climbing. I began tracking my diet, stretching twice a day, working with a coach, following climbing training plans, doing drills and mobility routines, tracking my weight everyday and finger strength every week; basically, everything that you can do to improve in climbing. This did help improve my climbing, but had an unexpected negative. With each week, training cycle, season, I grew more and more entitlement to my progress.



Although I began to get better, the progress was not as quick as some of my climbing partners who were getting better at the same rate or faster. This began to make me frustrated and oddly competitive with my friends (but again, I would try to keep this to myself and not let it out publicly); although this was easier to control, the entitlement began to impact myself. 



When I finished my most recent training cycle (12 weeks), I didn't quite improve much in my overall climbing ability. Climbing the same grades, but I tactically improved and was more well-rounded and yet, I couldn't see that. This began to weigh on me, as I saw others growing much quicker over this time, and I couldn't stop to appreciate the non-grade improvements I was making. All I could focus on was how I put so much time in x, and I still couldn't climb y. It began to impact the climbs I would hop on, and my ability to dig deep on climbs. I would be comfortably on a route 5.1x that would normally be a trickier route before all the training, but I couldn't stop thinking about how I should be on route 5.1x + 1 with all the work and effort I was putting in.



The thing is, I didn't realize how toxic this was for me and how this entitlement was holding me down and actually preventing my progress. The weight of my entitlement was quite literally **weighing me down on my climbs** and was impacting my mental ability to try hard on climbs. I noticed that as soon as I made a small mistake on a route, I could feel myself becoming disappointed and my energy would evaporate. I would then either send or shortly fall, and both of which, would often ruin the session for me. Then I was trying less hard in my sessions, and the problem only compounded.



The more training I put in, the more weight I felt while climbing. The more years of hard training, the more I felt like I "deserved" more. It finally came to a climax when my SO told me how toxic my expectations for performance were and how tough I was on myself after a particularly rough session. I then did a bit of introspection and really began to analyze how to approach climbing in a healthier manner.



The biggest things I took away were:

* The more entitled I felt for a certain grade, the worse I climbed. (The more weight I carried up the climb)
* No matter how much work you put in, you don't deserve any sends. You still have to do it, and climbing is hard.
* Feeling entitled is natural and okay. Denying it will lead you down a bad path, but recognize it and let it go.
* Progress isn't always shown in the grade you climb.



Training hard is awesome and pushing yourself is amazing, but as soon as you start letting your entitlement build, you are just adding more weight onto your back every time you step on the wall. Don't let yourself fall into this trap. Recognize entitlement, but be humble. Let it go. Surprise yourself.



It's not easy and I still struggle with it, but the more I recognize it, the less it impacts me when I climb. The more times I just let my expectations go and enjoy climbing, the more I enjoy climbing and often, the more I perform better.



I wonder if anyone else can relate to this, and I hope this reaches out to some of you out there and provides some insight to help you out.
Advice for how to push my grade higher So I’ve been climbing for just under 3 years, and the whole time has just been for fun recreationally and occasionally doing a competition with my school. Now I want to start actually training so I can push my grade outdoors and compete at a higher level indoors.

About me:
- 17 years old (climbed since 14/15)
- 6’3 ft tall
- 70kgs (154pounds)
- highest grade indoors is 7b+ (5.12c)
- many 7a/+’s climbed, not many 7b’s
- Boulder max is V8

I’m not particularly strong for a climber, I’m quite skinny, I can do pull/muscle ups, but not one arm pull ups. I think my finger strength is okay, I have a beast 2000 at home. 

I’m looking for some advice on what exercises/training i should do to push my grade higher. I have a goal of doing some more 7b+’s by the end of this year, and reaching 7c (5.12d) by next summer. I don’t have access to a local gym and I climb around 2/3 times a week, so body weight workouts/ finger boarding would be good for the non climbing days, and then I can train in the climbing gym on the other days. My endurance isn’t that bad but I still feel I get tired quickly if I’m trying a very hard route. 

I’ve competed in a few comps before, more recently in the British Lead Championships, and all of the competitors have coaches and specific training regimens, and I feel like I’m a little out of place with my dad (a total non climber) as my support team and no formal coaching at all. So I’m just looking for some tips for personal improvement of my climbing. Thanks!
Coaches of Climbharder - resources you found valuable to improve your skill set? This question is primarily aimed towards people who are (or have been) actively employed as rock climbing / bouldering coaches.

I've got +15yrs of rock climbing experience but I'm just beginning my journey as a rock climbing instructor and am especially keen to 'fast track' myself down the route of performance coaching. At this early stage I'm not exactly sure how this will take shape over time. Initially I'll be gaining experience assisting coaching youth groups and individuals through my local climbing wall's internal setup. Then subsequently will probably be looking to coach private individuals.

Other people who have gone down this career route, which resources did you find especially helpful to aid your development and improve your skill set as a rock climbing coach?

Are there any significant DOs/DONTs or a list of tips/advice you'd offer to someone that you wish you'd known about earlier in your career?

Thanks all for taking the time to read this and any positive input you might have.

EDIT - thanks to everyone who has replied. Lots of really helpful advice.
What is your opinion on doing linkups in the lead climbing gym? I have heard this - independently - from two very strong climbers.

To train endurance in the gym, they will do linkups of two routes: leading the first, lowering and pulling the rope quickly, and then without a break starting the second one. Ideally the difficulty will be such that you fall off towards the end of the second route from being super pumped.

To me this sounds very beneficial: Most gym routes are quite short, so one will usually train power endurance for shorter sequences. On these sort of routes, resting/shaking out the better holds will not be something that is trained (there are no holds that are good enough to regain energy). More importantly, climbing in a really pumped state and managing the pump doesn't really happen - usually i will fall off due to a move that i cannot do because i no longer have power, but without being really pumped. However, when doing hard&amp;long climbs outside, i feel that both the ability to rest on alright holds and to keep going while super pumped are very important and something that people that only sport climb outside are insanely good at - conversely, i am very bad at both, but have good power endurance...

Did someone do this sort of training before and has opinions/advice/perspective regarding this? I don't ever see people doing this in the gym that i go to (including people stronger than me), why is that?

For reference, my hardest redpoints outside are   7c, and i want to train for an 8a+ that i want to seriously try in the fall (15° overhanging endurance climb on slopers and crimps where the individual moves are not super hard).
Chin ups on small holds: is there a reason this doesn't seem to be widely recommended? Hi folks. For the last few months, I've incorporated pull ups on the smallest holds on my finger board into my routine. I feel like it has made a substantial impact. It feels great to pull through a crimp on a hard problem and really feel in control. 

I don't think I've seen any tutorial videos recommend this kind of thing. Is there a reason for that? (Or have I just not seen the ones that do?) It makes me feel sore in all the right places, and subjectively, it seems enormously valuable. 

In case you're curious, I do moderate hangs: 10x 15-20 second hangs on different holds, 3 times. I've replaced two of those hangs with pull ups, for a total of 6 sets of pull ups. I either do 2-3 on the smallest hold or 3-5 on the second-smallest hold. Lately, however, I have been doing fewer pulls but incorporating a 2 second lock-off, to address a weakness I have with lock-offs on crimps.

Edit: Replaced "chin ups" with "pull ups."

Cheers
Friendly reminder: max hangs aren't the only way to stronger fingers. Seen a lot of posts/comments lately with sort of generalized comments along the lines of "max hangs are the best way to build finger strength for climbing".

Like anything in climbing, finger strength is a combination of several factors. The best hangboard routine is going to depend on your personal weakest factor.

Connective tissue strength and recruitment of muscle fiber? Max hangs are probably a good choice. Recruitment pulls are a newer alternative as well.

Lack of forearm musculature? Repeaters will win out for hypertrophy due to the increased overall volume.

Finger stiffness, skin for small holds, topping up for a trip? Min edge will get you in good sending shape and condition your skin and joints to pull hard on small edges.

The most important point: the best routine is the one you'll actually stick to doing. A good routine followed strictly is better than a great one followed loosely. Remember that it can take 6-8 weeks to see a change, so don't give up too fast either.

Post script:

Transferring hangboard gains onto the wall? Actual climbing at your limit!

Injury rehab? Separate topic entirely, but no hangs have been showing great promise in this regard these past few years.
Spectrum of isometric strength Hi everyone

I recently spent some time studying content provided by Tyler Nelson (c4hp). Specifically the distinction of overcoming and yielding isometric muscle action, which seems to be a concept widely overlooked right now.

After a deep dive into the scientific background I contacted Tyler Nelson about some open questions I had. In the aftermath he dropped some more interesting information regarding this topic on instagram. I haven’t seen this being discussed/mentioned here in detail, so here we go...

Here are some interesting resources for everyone wanting to dive deeper into the details:

* [https://www.sportsmith.co/articles/all-isometric-training-is-not-the-same-differences-in-the-execution-prescription-and-use-of-pushing-and-holding-isometrics/](https://www.sportsmith.co/articles/all-isometric-training-is-not-the-same-differences-in-the-execution-prescription-and-use-of-pushing-and-holding-isometrics/)
* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5426061/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5426061/)

**To sum it up**

* Isometric muscle action covers a spectrum that links concentric muscle action with eccentric muscle action
* There seem to be two different types of isometric muscle action: A pushing/pulling isometric muscle action (PIMA, or overcoming) and a holding isometric muscle action (HIMA, or yielding).
* PIMA seems to be more “concentric-like”
* HIMA seems to be more “eccentric-like”
* Where on the spectrum we operate is dictated by either load or proximity to failure.
* The more on the eccentric-like side we operate, the more we depend on passive tension.

Deep-dive into the mechanisms behind passive tension:

* [https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/217/16/2825/13772/The-role-of-titin-in-eccentric-muscle-contraction](https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/217/16/2825/13772/The-role-of-titin-in-eccentric-muscle-contraction)

**Implications for finger strength training**

The implications of this information for finger strength training have largely been compiled by Tyler Nelson on his instagram account and in this blog post:

* [https://www.camp4humanperformance.com/blog-2/2020/12/14/think-before-you-hang-there-really-is-a-difference](https://www.camp4humanperformance.com/blog-2/2020/12/14/think-before-you-hang-there-really-is-a-difference)

In the blog post he describes the method he popularized (pulling on an edge you can’t hang with one hand,) as PIMA... which it actually isn’t, regarding the finger flexors. Given your upper body pulling muscles are stronger than your fingers, your finger flexors would actually perform HIMA. This was the reason I contacted him in the first place. The correct way of performing finger flexor PIMA is somewhat tricky and has to impede the possibility of loading your fingers eccentrically. The “correct” setup is shown by Tyler Nelson in the following post:

* [https://www.instagram.com/p/ChArVVmuR-P/](https://www.instagram.com/p/ChArVVmuR-P/)

Some of the follow up posts show alternative methods of doing this, but are prone to error if not executed correctly.

Basically the conclusions are:

With HIMA style training (e.g. the typical max hangs) and the focus on a prescribed time under tension (e.g. 5s - 10s) we load our fingers beyond the level of muscle recruitment and rely on passive tension to a certain degree. This at the cost of more fatigue and reduced recruitment adaptations. The suggestion is, to measure your active tension potential with the PIMA setup, and use that as the base for the hangboard workouts. Moreover, it might be better to focus on reps instead of time under tension. Details on Tyler Nelson’s suggested protocol:

* [https://www.instagram.com/p/ChSXTLVufNe/](https://www.instagram.com/p/ChSXTLVufNe/)

In short, this might be the scientific background to the recently often promoted need for some more “sub maximal” hangboard training phases in the around 80% intensity range (this might for some of us be around the active tension potential).

**Appendix**

**Relation between active and passive peak force**

After doing some testing, I noticed some interesting differences between Tyler’s measurements and mine. Some of these might be due to the way he does some of his testing (e.g. different positioning when doing hangs compared to when pulling etc). But these might be negligible.

His active peak force (51kg?) is around 59% of his passive peak force (88kg?) \[numbers from his instagram\]. For me, it is around 75%. I wonder if the relation of those numbers would actually tell us something specific. Something like, A should focus on developing active tension potential, B should develop his passive tension potential. But I wasn't able to find any established performance norms regarding this in order to make any meaningful assumptions...

By intuition I would assume, the closer both values are together, the more you might profit from working on passive tension, the further apart the more you might profit from focusing on active tension.

**Eccentrics**

The statement of HIMA having "reduced recruitment adaptations" might be correct, due to short term effects the buildup of passive tension has. But: during eccentric muscle action higher threshold, fast-twitch muscle fibers are recruited first, in contrast to recruitment for concentric muscle action. If this applies to HIMA/PIMA as well, the generally reduced recruitment adaptation is complemented by  additional and important recruitment adaptations that PIMA would only provide if taken close to failure (less or no reps in reserve with the rep based protocol) \[**Edit**: This is not quite right. Given the PIMA reps are maximal, which Tyler basically suggests, they will also be recruiting the higher threshold motor units. Only difference might be the order and/or timing of recruitment\].
Do you climb before, after, or not at all on Max Hang days during a cycle leading up to a season? I’m starting up a training cycle including max hangs for 8-10 weeks leading into the good weather in the red river gorge. Since the red is so damn pumpy, I want to still climb a fair amount on overhung juggy/pumpy routes in these weeks leading up to November, but I would like to be cautious of overdoing it and leaving myself open to injury.

Is doing a handful of pumpy routes before a max hang session a bad idea since you’re getting tired, or is it an appropriate warm up in moderation? Perhaps getting pumped after using the hangboard would make sense because you’re fingers are primed to pull hard, but again I don’t want to injure myself when the temps are about to get good.

As a side note, I like to take at least a full day off after a day where I do a max hang session, for recovery, preferably two days off or a very light day on the second day after the session.

Perhaps it would be best to simply not climb harder (for me) pumpy routes on the same day as max hangs, but then if I’m getting enough time off to rest after the board session, that only really leaves like one day a week for endurance and it seems like the total volume would be pretty low. Anyone have some more experience on the subject?
I analysed 4 million climbing ascents to answers some common questions that are asked in climbing. I'd love to hear your feedback :)
Bouldering Duty Cycle Hi!  First post here for me!

So, I was reading the Anderson Bros book and they were talking about how the 7/3 protocol is loosely based on the duty cycle of advanced climbers.  I'm focused on bouldering, and thought this seemed off.  I tracked the time on/off for each hand in some of my own climbing (and Drew Ruana on Sleepwalker just to make sure I'm not climbing really strangely) and found that the duty cycle was nothing like this!  I will post the data at the end, but basically fingers never spend more than 2s off the rock during hard sequences, and often are holding tension for &gt;10 seconds.  The duty cycle is nowhere near 7:3, for the crux it seems common to be more like 10:1!

Why aren't hangboard protocols designed to match this duty cycle?  I've never seen anybody discuss something like a 13s on, 2s off protocol, but that (with maybe 3 reps) seems to me to way more specific to pulling through a boulder's crux.  It seems like it would target very different failure modes than 7-3, or 10-5, or max hangs.  Anybody have thoughts on this?

Cheers

Data as promised:

Climbed pretty hard after only swimming this summer. Does anyone else train like this? This summer, I have been living at the beach. Instead of climbing at a gym 1+ hour away, I have been surfing, body surfing, swimming, and biking every day; and I have been doing sit-ups/leg lifts and lifting exercises with a cinderblock. 

After \~2 months of not climbing at all, I was still flashing pretty stout v5's last week and OS 5.11a. I think swimming and paddling on a surfboard has done wonders for my basal climbing abilities -especially my shoulders and back.

 I know I have to focus on hangboarding more because I was getting pumped super fast on slabby moves, but my shoulder mobility and strength was awesome on dihedrals. Doing hard gastons and keeping tension on overhangs was also tougher than I remember, likely because they are climbing specific movements. 

I am super happy with the results intensive swimming has had on my climbing. I was wondering if anyone else can relate. 

TLDR: Swimming and surfing has helped me maintain my climbing abilities after a 2 month hiatus. Can anyone relate?
DIP synovitis success story I've had a problematic finger for around five years, and finally found a way to fix it. Since I've tried a lot of things, I thought I'd share what I found helpful (and also what didn't work for me). Disclaimer: this is obviously very anecdotal.

My symptoms were swelling at the long finger DIP joint, and sharp pain from certain grip types. It was not predictable when the pain would come, but intensity and volume seemed to be negative factors. Small crimps were however not worse than bigger holds. The worst holds were those that pushed against on the joint. I was also unable to make a fist.

A list of things I had tried:

1. Resting
2. Light hangboarding
3. Heavy finger rolls
4. Finger stretching / mobility
5. Rice bucket
6. Glucosamine supplement
7. NSAID (diclofenac)

A few things that didn't seem to do anything (other than maybe act as a short-term placebo): supplements, NSAID creams and rice buckets.

Resting made the finger feel better, but when I resumed climbing it just very quickly started hurting again. I think rest is an important factor, but it doesn't work on its own.

Hangboarding migt have worked, but I think I should have dialed the difficulty back even further. It was also tricky because the larger hangboard holds push more on the joint, aggravating it.

Fast-forward to this summer: I had climbed almost exclusively outside (sport) for a few months and my fingers were better than ever. I went to the gym once and the finger started hurting. That's when I decided it was time to make a final attempt to fix it, using everything I had learned:

* Avoid gym climbing (for now)
* Work on finger mobility
* Double down on finger rolls (start really light)
* Finally start hangboarding at really low intensity, in particular working on my half crimp form

For the [finger rolls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHKR2gyVhaQ) I only used a 7 kg dumbbell. I did it two times a day, 3 sets for 15-20 repetitions. It's not hard at all, but it feels like the fingers are more mobile afterwards.

To train mobility, I mostly just [opened and closed my hand repeatedly](https://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en_US/stories/experience-story-esther-smith-nagging-finger-injuries/). I did some stretching of the fingers, but nothing too aggressive. [I also incorporated a light pulling on the finger.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-nOPJsBZz8)

I continued climbing outdoors, 3-4 times per week. I think the reason it kind of works for me is that even if it can be quite intense, you usually have a lot of rest between attempts and I wouldn't tie in more than 3-4 times for a session.

It's been about six weeks now, and two weeks ago I was able to make a fist again. I'm also able to hangboard and climb at the gym without any discomfort, even using grip types that were guaranteed to provoke pain before. Maybe it is still too early to tell, but I decided to write this post today anyway, before I forget too much.

\----

I'd like to add that there were two previous success stories that largely inspired what I decided to try in the end: both [this excellent article](https://stevenlow.org/beating-climbing-injuries-pip-synovitis/) and [an earlier post on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/dwdhyg/synovitis_cured/) already cover pretty much everything I have said. My reason for this post was to give one more account of what worked for me personally.
How did HRT affect your climbing? Hey,

I am likely going to be undergoing feminising hormone therapy at age 21, and I was curious how it has affected people's climbing ability. And if so, in  what way?

I'm currently climbing around V7 to V8 and was wondering if that's likely to drop by much. I'm not   massively bothered about it to be honest, but it would be interesting to hear about the nuances of how things changed (e.g., decrease in  power, or relative gains due to weight loss).

I'd also be interested to know how it developed over time, as obviously the maximal effects are often felt after say 2-5 years.

Does anyone have any tips or advice as well? I'm not really planning on doing anything particularly differently over this time period (other than perhaps focusing more on lower-body workouts). At the moment, climbing is pretty much my only form of exercise and I don't really train outside of just climbing and sometimes doing some campusing on a spray wall etc.

Did you lose much muscle mass? I have quite large shoulders and my back is pretty defined too. I do like this to some extent, but am a little bit worried about it looking unnatural once I have begun the hormone therapy.

Thanks.
Overcoming difficulties of beginning to hangboard Hey all, I have a Metolius hangboard I got recently and am having difficulties getting going. I am a V4-5 gym climber with years of experience (off and on) but just now trying to improve my climbing.

If I am failing a very high percentage of the time how would people recommend I get going? I am trying to use the first edge (29mm) for 5s but unless I am in a really good place with my fingers I can't hold it. Should I try half crimping the jugs and hopefully work my way down or should I invest in some weight bands to take some of my load off?

Reading tons of resources online I am just surprised that the beginner exercises expect you can do so much already. I don't think of myself as an amazing climber but I thought I could do the bare minimum more than I am experiencing.

That said this is clearly my weakness and I expected so I look forward to improving here. Any help would be really valued!

*True* Beginner Hangboard Routine I see a lot of people, both here and in real life, looking to start hangboarding but feeling too weak/inexperienced/intimidated to start. I thought I'd offer a routine that I've seen work for a few beginner climbers. 

**Routine**

The routine is to add 1-2 days per week where you train "no-hangs" on a hangboard. A no-hang is where your feet are planted, but you still pull hard on an edge as though you wanted to get off the ground. Some people like to use an analog scale to get an idea for the % of their body weight that they're moving, but that is quite optional. Sets/reps can be flexible, but I'd recommend 2 or 3 grips - like open hand, half crimp, and 3 finger drag - and holds that are a bit too small for you to actually hang from. Then for each grip/hold, do a set of 6 reps, 7s on and 3s off. Rest between sets should be minimum one minute. 

**Rationale**

Why do I recommend this? It's a great way to start hangboarding for a beginner - no pulleys, weights, or super complicated schemes. No real risk of injury because your feet are always planted. Just pull hard on edges and gain some strength and comfort before tackling a more demanding program. Adding this routine on top of your existing climbing is a reasonable increase in training volume, as opposed to a huge jump that'll lead to injury. Also, it allows newer climbers to improve their finger strength faster while still primarily climbing. 

**Common Criticisms**

A lot of people will argue that you should "just climb until V[x] at least" but I think that (1) novices will ignore you and hangboard anyways and (2) people have different starting finger strength and it may be beneficial to add a focus on finger strength earlier.
Simple, Effective loaded mobility routine Hi all, In the last 2 or so months I decided to start working on my mobility and my strength through active range of motion in the lower body and saw massive gains so I wanted to share what worked for me. Hope this can help someone and am happy to hear any thoughts and opinions!

Basically it was a fairly short session \~20 min 2 times a week, 3 when I had time. It consisted of 5 exercises and a dynamic warmup(swinging legs, hip rotations, general cardio warmup) 

The 5 exercises are ;

Weighted Cossack squat (as deep as you comfortably can) 3x 8-12  1' rest (add weight or increase ROM)

Weighted forward lunge (increase ROM rather than weight if possible) 3x8-12  1' rest

Weighted horse squat  3x20-30" : 1'rest

Deep squat with hip rotation: 2x15 (helpful for deep dropknees)

Frog position (Nice passive stretch to finish) 3x 30"-1'

**The times and rep schemes are indicative, Tweak everything to what suits you.**

I've found this has translated to my climbing very very well so hoping it can help you do the same!
Video analysis: help getting into small boxes One year of climbing on the Moonboard has exposed a glaring weakness: getting into, establishing myself in, and moving out of small boxes.

My initial response has been to chalk it up to morphology (I'm 6'0"/183cm w/ long legs, a short torso, and a +2" ape index) but I know that's just an excuse. I want to develop the skills to turn this weakness into a strength.

This is me on Les Boréades, a 7A BM that has given me particular trouble.

I don't have much trouble with the hand-foot match but as soon as I release the left hand my hips sag away from the wall. Absent fully locking off the right hand, I'm just don't know how to generate downward pressure on the left foot without forcing my hips out.

What do I need to do for this particular move to maintain better position?
Alpinism: How to balance climbing training with strength/cardio training? My ultimate goal is to get into alpinism - I fantasize about long difficult approaches to remote mountains where I then embark on several pitches of trad climbing to get to the summit.

However, my cardio and hiking ability is absolutely shit. I’m by far the worst hiker I’ve ever met, I’m a 26 year old male but most middle aged obese women are better hikers than me. I know if I want to eventually get into alpinism I need to not only be a strong climber but also a strong hiker.

The thing is most alpinism fitness training programs I’ve looked into require around 3-4 days/week of cardio and strength training, each session being several hours long. However, I’m already doing 3 multi hour sessions of indoor climbing + 1 day of outside sport climbing a week. Unless I literally live in the gym I don’t see how I can balance both getting better at technical climbing and also squeezing in the necessary strength and cardio training for alpinism…

I’m already barely improving at climbing as it is, if I cut down on my existing climbing regime I know I’ll stop progressing whatsoever.
The Rock Climbers Training Manual Strength Cycle: Boring, but amazingly effective I've had success with the other RCTM cycles but always avoided the strength cycle due to the extremely low amount of climbing in it, but finally bit the bullet and my god the improvement has been insane. It's a 3 day cycle: Day 1 you do 20 to 30m of easy climbing, a fuck ton of hangboarding with the 7-3 repeaters, and then 2 to 5 exercises in the 3 to 5 rep range, day 2 is an optional aerobic exercise day, and day 3 is 2 x 20m ARC training and then you start one day 1 again.

Here are my values for the first day HB1 on Aug 13th:
7s on 3s off 6 to 7 times 1 min rest and repeat with higher effort. Note that I treated the jug and large open as a warm up and did not push that hard on them. Negative numbers indicate weight removed from bodyweight. Hangboard used was the one recommended from the book and my own pinch blocks I made. Weight is 175 lbs.

Jug: +0, +10lbs
Large open 4: +0, +5
middle+ ring pocket: -40, -30lbs
8mm edge: -80, -80
imr pocket: +0, +5
pinch block: +25, +25
sloper: +0,+0
narrow pinch: +20, +20

Lifts: All 2x3

1 arm pull: no idea for weight removed here but did feel significantly progress
Barbell OHP: 85, 90
Weighted pullup: +55, +65
Bench: 155, 155



And then here are my numbers on the final day Hangboard session 8 on 9/4



Jug: +0, +25
Large Open 4: +0, +15
MR Pocket: -15, -0 (most proud of the progress here)
8mm edge: -60, -50
imr pocket: +0, +25
pinch: +35, +35
sloper: +0, +25 (failed on last second of last rep, the only failed rep during the entire cycle)
narrow pinch: +25, +25

Lifts: all 2x2

1arm: significantly faster with less assistance, I estimate 15 to 20 pounds of assistance
OHP: 105, 115
Weighted Pullup: +70, +95 (then a +110 1rm)
Bench: 185, 195




Overall highly recommend this routine if you can stand doing basically no hard climbing for a few weeks. I can't wait to apply these gains to climbing now. I have recently purchased a lattice performance climbing plan and can't wait to hop into that with my new gains.
I updated my climbing analysis to answer a few more questions that came from Reddit The original post is available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/wxhipa/i_analysed_4_million_climbing_ascents_to_answers/). These are the new questions answered in the article:

* [What grade should you sport climb given your maximum bouldering grade?](https://www.alessandromasullo.com/blog/analysis-of-4-million-climbing-ascents/#max_redp_vs_max_boulder)
* [How does the age you start climbing affect progression?](https://www.alessandromasullo.com/blog/analysis-of-4-million-climbing-ascents/#progression-for-different-age)
* [How many routes are you expected to climb at your maximum grade before climbing the next grade?](https://www.alessandromasullo.com/blog/analysis-of-4-million-climbing-ascents/#number-of-ticks-before-the-next-grade)

There are still a few things I want to do but I hope you find this interesting :)
Has anyone done Emils twice a day hangboarding routine consistently? It's been more than a year since Emil posted the twice a day hangboard routine video.  I was wondering if anyone has done this **consistently for long periods of time (3-6+ months)** and found it helpful for recovery/tendon health. 

Original concerns:

* He is much stronger than me/ he is an elite climber
* He already climbs 3 days on one off (his capacity is 2x mine- maybe he can just handle extra training)
* Is it just increasing tendon stiffness? This was my biggest concern, that it was great for a month, but really better as a periodized plan, otherwise it might lead to injury.

Given the last bullet above, I am wondering if it really works and just helps get extra blood flow and and a light stretch to the tendons (promoting recovery).  I thought if folks have been doing this for a very long time we might have some longer tests.  I am curious if anyone had been doing it consistently if folks got injured (because too much tendon stiffening) after 90+ days or if folks found it helpful.

Video being referenced: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBTI9qiH4UE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBTI9qiH4UE)
20mm strength not translating to smaller edges I recently tested my finger strength and managed to hang for 7s on a 20 mm edge with 120lb added weight at 160lb body weight. That was pretty strong so I wasn't displeased with that at all, but I was kinda worried because I have been plateaued for a while climbing around V5-V6 and by the lattice climbing grade calculator I should be projecting quite a few grades higher, so I figured I must actually just suck at climbing and have bad technique/not try very hard so I've been focusing a lot on climbing more. But I recently was playing around on the hangboard and different edge sizes and noticed my strength declines significantly as I move to smaller holds, and I mean like a significant and scary amount. I could hold body weight at 15 mm for about 20 seconds and could barely hold body weight at 10 mm for 5 seconds and anything lower I couldn't hold at all, given that I can hold 175% of my body weight at 20mm this seems really weird and confusing to me and was wondering if anyone had any insights as to what might be going on.

For context I've been climbing 8 years with only a few breaks from either covid, injuries, or life getting in the way, in the past I have climbed much harder than I do now at one point consistently projecting V8 and higher. I have suffered and recovered from a few A2 pulley injuries in the past, and in recovery from these injuries I started hangboarding more consistently and its something I found to really help my overall finger health. That being said, I have almost always used larger edge sizes and never really trained anything but open hand holds. This is partly because I started hangboarding as rehab from pulley injuries but also I have really never consistently half crimped or full crimped while climbing in my entire life, idk why it's just not a habit I've ever developed and it never felt natural or strong to me.

Could my lack of crimping be the thing holding me back from any small holds? I imagine my weakness on smaller holds is a significant impediment to breaking back out of the V5/V6 range, but has anyone else had experience with such a large discrepancy in strength among different edge sizes?
A year into committing to climbing - Like a lot of people after the lock down, I had gained weight, felt lazy and unproductive. I desperately wanted to get back into sports. I remembered that I had climbed on and off from being 18 – 23 (more off than on as it can be pricey!) 

My La Sportiva climbing shoes staring me down, I went back, looking to pick up where I left off. 
 
That was not the case. 
 
When I stopped at 23, I could flash V5s and project V7s. When I returned, my climbing shoes felt loose, which didn’t matter much, as at the age of 26, I was knocked down to V3 at max. It was crushing and infuriating. I am sure a lot of people can relate. 

I knew I was better than this, but in those 3 years, I wasn’t doing pull ups or deadhangs, I would occasionally do push ups and crunches through the lockdown. But I can’t say I was training. Add to this I gained nearly 20kg of weight, and I understood why I was having such a hard time, but that didn’t make accepting it any easier.

I committed to climbing 3 times a week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday after work. I had a friend who wanted to climb also, but he was totally new, so I had a partner to hold me accountable if I wanted to quit (which I definitely recommend). In my 3rd week I topped a V5 with open palm holds and smearing all the way round. It was hard, but reminded me that I have that ability in there somewhere!

After 3 months I was able to climb through the V3s consistently and V4s were projects. The more important thing for me though, is I had made friends at the centre through being consistent. This was a defining moment in getting back into climbing. They were all better than me, they could get up the campus board, they could do the heel hooks and cruise up the V5/6s. I had people to help me.

I know everyone has their own progress route, but personally I respond to competition, and short-term goals. I started hanging off the campus board after 3 months, which puts us in September. By December, I had got up the 35mm rungs, and reached the 8th rung on the 25mm rungs. I had caught up to my new friends and overtaken a few of them, which I saw as being good for my strength. I’ve never been able to do this before, so I am doubly psyched to land these. I try a weighted pinch block and can lift 35kg, which was more than those around me. I recognise I am strong, but I’m not losing weight, so I kind of need to be strong.

At the 7-month mark, I have topped 3 V5s, a V6 and 2 V7s. This for most people would be good enough, they would be happy, but at my local centre, the V4s still need work to top out and I see my friends flash them on “high gravity days". 

I lost focus and left sustained training, and started to go back into bad habits. As a dickhead 19-year-old, I would campus and dyno up EVERYTHING I COULD, which I started doing again. I started to flow with the return to dynamic climbing, which at 92kg in bodyweight, is not easy. 

2 months later my local centre started a 4 month long climbing league. There are 190 men competing and the first round was humbling. I set about trying to complete the boulder problems on the first night and I left happy in 7th place, 3 days later I was 19th. A friend said I needed to really work on my technique to both A) improve overall ability, and B) get higher in the competition. 

I set about studying techniques and getting friends who are coaches to help give me advice. I’ll share it with you.
1)      Don’t pull with your arms. It seems like everyone is pulling with their arms up a wall, they’re not, they’re weighting their feet and pushing through their legs.
2)      Always work on hip flexibility, you will never regret being more flexible on the wall, and as a former rugby player, I really feel this.
3)      Watch your feet as you place them, make solid triangles even with your flags.
4)      Don’t forget that FAIL is an acronym, First Attempt In Learning, you are going to fall a lot in climbing. Take a break, review what you did and try new things. Even if you sent it, try it a new way, try new beta on old climbs to strengthen your techniques and route reading.

I finished the first round in 10th place with some projecting and I was happy about that. There were a lot of people joint 23rd. 

The second round started 2 weeks later and I had moved away, but closer to a boulder specialist centre called The Depot. I start training with those 4 lessons, a circuit of campus, stretching and hangboard. I came back to the 2nd round after one night, I left the place in 8th, where I stayed, no one topping me. I never sent anymore routes, but didn’t feel like I should break myself trying.

I finished the 3rd round in 9th place and that left me in 9th overall before the final round. This genuinely psyched me up. I was a year into climbing and I was beating people who had previously sniggered at me struggling at V4s. It was a good feeling.

Then a doctor found a tumour in my hand and it needed surgery, and that means missing the 4th round (maybe, its still live now and my hand post-op feels good, but I don’t want to be dumb). Thankfully it wasn’t cancer, but I had it cut out and that means 3 weeks minimum. I may be able to get the low-level climbs in the final night, but there’s no guarantee.

In my time away, I have been focused on my flexibility which has seen huge improvements in the 2 weeks where I have just been training that. 

So why did I want to share this? Because out there somewhere, someone is thinking that it will take years of training to get through to the top-level climbs in their centre. I want to tell them that consistency and friends will get you far further than you’ll ever know. Read and watch as much as you can, be inspired, and be passionate and you’ll fly through the grades. In the last year I broke a finger, broke 2 toes, tore a pulley, caught covid, developed tennis elbow and I have still managed 2 V7s, and made it half way up a 8B+ in a boulder cave.

They will go, I promise you! 

Good luck and stay psyched!!
12 week cycle with lattice training I just completed my first cycle of training with lattice. I did the 12 week boulder plan. This was my first taste of structured training and properly working on my weakness. I've been climbing for 4 years now and use to just go into the gym to project and saw consistent results. In March/April I started to notice a plateau and knew I needed to make a change in what I was doing. 

**These were my basic metrics that were measured to create my plan.** 

weight: 165lbs 

height: 5'10 

ape index: 5'10 

hip flexibility (box split) 5'2

2 rep weight pull up: 85lbs added, total weight 250lbs (151%)

2 arm 20mm hang for 7sec: 50lbs added, total weight 215lbs (130%)

7:3 repeaters at 60% until failure: 100 sec 

**At the end of the 12 week program these were my numbers after re-testing**  

weight: 145lbs 

height: 5'10 

ape index: 5'10 

hip flexibility (box split) 5'7

2 rep weight pull up: 90lbs added, total weight 235lbs (162%)

2 arm 20mm hang for 7sec: 80lbs added, total weight 225lbs (155%)

7:3 repeaters at 60% until failure: 180 sec

I was very pleased with my results and am excited to start my next cycle and start specifying my training to my weakness now that I have built a solid base. I signed up for the 24 week bouldering plan as I loved the structure and I've found it almost more fun to train than climb. I fell in love with the moonboard and kilter board. weight training and the hip mobility also took my climbing to the next level. I'm stoked for the next cycle to begin after this deload week. 

I will update again in 12 weeks after my retest, hopefully have some new tests that show different variations of this data. 

Thanks for taking the time to read my short report. 

**Feel free to ask any questions in the comments would love to answer any y'all may have, I know I left a lot of information out of this report.**
First time setting! Would love feedback on both the climbing and the setting. Wall is slabby but close to vertical. Gym members graded it V5
Structure and Record your own Campus Board session Hey guys,

I really wanted an app that could effectively record and structure my campus board routine while also being really flexible.  I couldn’t find anything like it on the app store so I decided to build it myself.  Unfortunately, for now it is only for android but I would move it to ios if there is sufficient interest.

If you check it out, I’d appreciate it!

Feedback wanted for my training plan for becoming a consistent 7a boulderer I have been climbing (bouldering) for about 3 years (incl. lockdown) exclusively indoors. Due to my location it's not possible to go climbing outdoors without traveling far. 

Why a training plan? I like to train and would love some more structure so I don't waste time in the gym or feel lost. 

---

***Goals***

In general I just want to improve in climbing (don't we all?). I recently climber my first 7A and I am close to sending 2 others and would like to comfortably project 7As and higher.

Biggest goal would be not to get injured so I could keep making progress. In the past I have had some elbow &amp; shoulder issues but these seems to be under control at the moment. (Right arm only)

I also started Moonboarding 3 months ago and I'm currently grinding the BMs: I sent 20/28 V3 BMs and 2 V4 BMs (didn't properly project V4 or higher yet cause I wanted to build a nice base of V3s). I think sending a MB V6 BM would be a good medium LT goal. 

---

***Strenghts &amp; weakenesses***

Due to my young climbing age I think I still have to improve in all aspects so I'm making sure that I climb on all type of walls even though I prefer roofs and overhang. 

If I have to point out one strength I would pick my pulling power, I think this one should be good enough to reach a higher grade without extra training. 

Besides improving in all aspects (bouldering) I'm trying to focus following weaknesses with this plan: fingerstrength &amp; flexibility (especially hip mobility/flexibility).

---

***Some general stats***

Age: 27

Height: 5ft6

Weight: 134 pounds

Pull Ups: should be around 14-15, maybe more if I would rest a bit between

Max. Pull Up: not training them atm but could do about BW + 18kg for 5 reps a couple of months ago

Hangboard: don't know my max hang but used to do repeaters (6on10off x5 half crimp &amp; open handed) during lockdown on 20mm which felt alright

---

***Plan***


* Each morning before work I do a short mobility routine of +- 15 mins, mainly focusing on hips
* Trying to do mobility/flexibility work on the 'rest days', will follow YT videos for this
* Sleep should be on point, about 8 hours each day
* Protein intake about 1gr/pound
* In the past I think I have been undereating which caused injuries I suspect, I'm upping my calories for training to make sure I'm properly fueled
* Trying to keep this a simple as possible so it's sustainable to follow more than 2 weeks
* Ending the session when I feel my power is gone
* After 3 weeks I will deload (50% less volume), not sure if I'll try to increase the intensity each week (maybe increase the number of problems on the boulder triplets?)

&amp;nbsp;

**Monday** - *Active rest*

* TRX Circuit x3 (30s plank - 30s rest - 30s saw - 30s rest - 30x mountain climbers) -&gt; will progress to less rest 
* Cardio (jogging) for 30m max. 

**Tuesday** - *Hard bouldering*

* Warm up (off wall) - 10m max.
* V-Warm Up (on wall) - 30m max. -&gt; building up to my projecting grade, trying to flash new easier problems &amp; repeating the ones I have done
* Hard bouldering - 90m -&gt; projecting new problems, usually 2-3 problems, with enough rest in between depending on the number of moves
* S&amp;C (off wall, TRX): Ts, Ys and Rows -&gt; to keep shoulders healthy
* Prehab: wrist roller, hammer rotation, isometric hang with neutral grip

**Wednesday** - *Antagonist &amp; general strength*

* Dumbbell Bench Press
* Overhead Press (dumbbell or kettlebell)
* Pistol squat/Bulgarian split squat
* TRX Hamstring curl
* Core: hanging leg raises, suitcase carries (uneven) &amp; palloff press

**Thursday** - *Full Rest*

* Full Rest

**Friday** - *Board Session*

* Warm up (off wall) - 10m max.
* V-Warm up (on wall) - 30m max.
* MB Warm up - 15m -&gt; a couple of easy problems
* MB Projecting -&gt; 45m max.
* Prehab circuit -&gt; same as the one before but adding some push ups

&amp;nbsp;
*My projecting consists of usually 2 max. 3 problems which I give a couple of attempts with plenty of rest in between (depending on number of moves). If a certain move however feels impossible after a couple of tries I usually find another problem. I prefer projecting routes on which I can usually do a couple of moves (not limit bouldering) so I get some mileage on the board. On high gravity days I usually try to aim for a higher volume, keeping the difficulty in the VFlash-2-3 tries on non bench marks.*

**Saturday** - *Active rest*

* Light cardio If I feel like it

**Sunday** - *Power endurance*

* Warm up (off wall) - 10m max.
* V-Warm up (on wall) - 30m max.
* Limit bouldering - 30 max. -&gt; one route max. giving it a couple of attempts, plenty of rest
* Boulder triplets -&gt; going to start with 3 routes 3 times and progress from there (1 min rest between the rep, 3 mins between boulders)
* TRX Circuit -&gt; same as Tuesday
* Prehab Circuit -&gt; same as Tuesday

---

My own remarks:

* Changing my climbing days isn't possible, I could swap sessions except for the MBing on Friday

* I didn't add any hangboarding cause I think MBing and climbing will give me enough stimulus at my level. However I'm open to suggestions to keep my fingers healthy (maybe some density hangs or recruitment pulls?) without overdoing it. 

* Added no drills cause I have to be honest with myself and find it very hard to keep doing them. However also open to suggestions.

* Sunday still feels a bit off to me... I would like to work on power endurance so I don't pump out fast and increase my work capacity however doing only bouldering triplets would be a very short workout. Limit bouldering seems maybe a bit excessive on that day? But can't find another moment to really program it. 

Thanks in advance for all the feedback and suggestions.
Help with osteoarthritis and how it affected your climbing Hey all,

About a month ago, I was diagnosed with osteoarthritis on my left middle MCP joint. General pain is triggered on slopers, some open hand crimps, or any sort of movement where it applies pressure to the base of my knuckles can cause issues, not to mention range of motion concerns from inflammation.

I'm not terribly old, but not a spring chicken either, so the solutions were to stop climbing or pain management. Surgery is out of the question and not sustainable. 

I'd like be able to continue climbing and training, but there's a strong mental block with me not wanting to commit to riskier moves on my left hand. I want to go back to hangboard training, but I don't know how to begin approaching building resistance to loading my left hand again. 

While there are rehabilitation exercises for general hand injuries, this sort of thing feels very specific, and I've noticed a lack of support for osteoarthritis in climbers. Plenty of articles for the former, and tons of generic advice for the latter, but nothing substantial for the combination of the two. 

If anyone has had any experience with dealing with any form of osteoarthritis and how it affected your climbing, whether it's training, giving up the sport altogether, exercises/therapy ideas, anything at all, please share them. It'd be greatly appreciated. 

This injury is 100% affecting me mentally, and it's a struggle to try and stay optimistic, especially with climbing temps getting better and better. Thanks!
I know where my technique is lacking but don't know why I can't engage right When I got back to climbing last year after a year and a half off, I spent 4 months stuck on indoor V4s without much progress. I dialed in my training, fixed some obvious weaknesses through strength training and deliberate engagement. There was a point 3-4 months later where things sort of clicked and I was crushing V7's. I had an unfortunate nerve injury in my shoulder that set me back a few months and knocked me back down to V5, but 5 months after recovery, I can't seem to make any progress.

I reviewed some videos of myself climbing some moonboard routes now vs a year ago before the injury. My butt sags, my shoulders are shrugged up by my ears, my hips engagement is pretty poor, and I just can't explode when I need to.

My shoulders are undeniably stronger than they were last year and I'm more flexible as well... I can't figure out why I can't engage right. I think my understanding of climbing mechanics is solid but for whatever reason, I just can't apply it no matter how deliberately I try.

Do I need to shift focus off of projecting and do more drills at/below my flash grade to get proper engagement to click again? Could the issue just be a lack of try-hard? I've been climbing \~once a week while focusing on strength and yoga for the past few weeks to rest my finger tensynovitis, so I'm hoping to give myself a reset and come back with a plan.
How do you overcome mental barriers? I’ve been an indoor boulderer for about 6 years.  3 years ago I fell on a slab problem - near the top of the wall, my right foot popped off a greasy chip, left got hung up on a larger hold, and I flipped upside down, landed on my head, and nearly paralyzed myself.   Ended up in the ER for a dozen X-rays and several MRI scans, missed 100 hours of work, and spent months in PT recovering and 3 weeks with symptoms from a bad concussion.
I got back to climbing 3 months later, and nearly had panic attacks my first several sessions.  I worked through it the best I could, but even now I struggle mentally on slab or slippery vertical problems and struggle to commit or bail out when it gets sketchy.  I find myself choosing steep problems to project, but I know I have a glaring weakness with vertical stuff now and I don’t like it. 

Those of you that have had bad accidents and continued to climb - how do you break through the mental barrier holding you back from climbing stronger? Any mental exercises you find helpful, sports therapist, etc?
Replacing bouldering sessions with Hangboard As said in the title, I am planning to replace a proper bouldering indoor sessions with Hangboard sessions(plus some pull ups, core and back BW exercises). For the next half a year I wont have any chance to climb inside, the only thing is my hangboard and pull up bar at home. Im already familiar with hangboarding and find it to be a great way to train in a controlled manner.

I will train every other day as far as I feel fresh and take some days off when needed.I find Hooper Hangboard Routine pretty much perfect for my needs. Here is how it looks like:At the beginning there is a 15-20 min full body warm up including pull ups, push ups and a bit of stretching. Then we come to the hangs

1. **Submax no weight** (Open hand, 30 sec hang on medium hold, 2 sets)
2. **Single arm recruitment pulls** (no hang,15mm hold, 5 sec x5 each arm, 3 sets)
3. **Submax Hang with weight** (Open hand, 20sec hang on large hold, +20%BW, 3 sets)
4. **Max Weight Hang** (Half crimp, 20mm, +25%BW, 10 sec, 5 sets)
5. **Repeaters 7:3** (Half crimp, 20mm, 5 reps, 4-6 sets)

So the main goal is to make Hangboard not a supplimential exercise, but rather a proper climbing related training to improve my strength.Any advices are apprecited!P.S. here is the routine and related video[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18SbJW3TSAEnyp8W4BjApqjN2CxTZIbAbqX4OZyfi0aQ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18SbJW3TSAEnyp8W4BjApqjN2CxTZIbAbqX4OZyfi0aQ)

Stretching your flexor tendons for healthier fingers? Hi there,

I injured 2 of my flexor tendon in my right hand and have been slowly rehabing back following this :

[https://www.hoopersbeta.com/library/flexor-digitorum-profundus-strain-how-to-heal-this-common-climbing-injury](https://www.hoopersbeta.com/library/flexor-digitorum-profundus-strain-how-to-heal-this-common-climbing-injury)

The article states that one of the causes of injury could be the flexor tendons being shortened :

&gt;\#3: Shortened FDP  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, shortening of the FDP can make them more prone to injury as they are less able to handle rapid lengthening of the muscle body and/or tendon and are typically weaker in a lengthened position. Commonly due to a combination of strengthening the tissue without stretching or lengthening the tissue, this shortened tissue can produce injuries when combined with some external factors. 

I believe this is my case since I had just about finished an 8-week cycle of max hangs in half crimp position. I have also never included any finger tendon stretching in my training.

It seems that there are multiple ways of stretching your tendons, but as often, the multitude of options makes it confusing as to what the best approach could be for me. Here is a list of what seems could help:

* Finger curls/rolls (is there a difference?) with a dumbell
* No hang crimp ups (open hand to crimp with a no hang device and weights)
* Density hangs (30 sec open hand hangs?)
* Max hangs with open hand?

So what is your approach to stretching your flexor tendons for enjoying some injury-free try-hard climbing? 

What are the benefits/risks for each of these exercises? 

Are there others I could benefit from?

Thanks!
How to train for a 40 meter 60° overhanging route? I have decided to make the next step in my climbing and try a grade i have never touched. 5.14 or 8b+. 
The route i have picked is an endurance monster, consisting of 80 moves which require everything from your body. Some more info about the route:
Moves: 80
Usual time to climb: 30-40 minutes
Type: very overhanging, around 60°
Hold type: mostly jugs
There isn't really a definiteve crux, but people usually fall at the last moves. There are a lot of kneebars where you can rest, which makes the route so slow to climb. Basically you climb for 1-2 minutes, rest 3-5 and repeat that. 

I want to train specifically for the route, but i have a hard time imagining how to be specific with it. Matching the time of climbing isn't really useful, because climbing for 30-40 minutes is basically too easy, if you don't have kneebars which won't replicate the stop and go nature of the route. 
Matching the number of moves is again not really that specific, because these moves won't be as hard in the gym and won't again match the stop and go nature of the route. 
Please give me your ideas!
What off the wall exercise can I do to improve my strength pressing sideways and down, overhead, so that I can match my left hand to my right.
Am I wrong, should I thrive for my breaking point? Hello!  
I was discussing with some climbing mates the other day, and they were describing an exercise that they love for resistance training (whatever that means, I'm guessing endurance).  
The exercice is to take one route, do it without resting, then again but normally with shaking/resting if needed, then again without any rest. If you manage to finish it, you need to do a harder one that you can't finish on the third run.  

My understanding is that reaching failure due to being so overpumped that you can't hold anything, is detrimental to a session. Excess of lactic acid and acidosis can take some time to go away, and muscles will not "get used" to excess lactic acid. They can however learn to create new capillaries that will flush lactic acid more easily, and you can improve your breathing, as well as having a better overall blood flow. 

How wrong am I? I'm usually training trying to avoid getting too pumped since my entire session is wasted after that if I don't take an half hour rest, even with active recovery. 

I tried to research the sub for that topic but didn't find any relevant results. Sorry if there was and I missed it.

Thanks for reading!

EDIT : great discussion as always from this sub, it seems that this kind of training is for power endurance, and is helpful every once in a while, and at the end of a session. I will try it in the future, thanks for all the input!
Home wall finished! Finished my project and wanted to post it up for others to see if they want something in between as cheap as possible and crazy expensive.

I wanted something that was 8x12, was extremely stable, didn't have legs in front or on the sides, didn't break the bank too badly, and looked amazing.

Started out trying to DIY a board with just wood but it slowly morphed into this as I weighed options.

Revival Climbing Coalition 8x12

I went with the manually adjustable version as it saved quite a bit of money. The quality on this thing is absolutely top notch and after rigorous testing, I would put it against all the big name wall producers in terms of visuals and usability. It's solid as a rock and imo looks amazing.  It was also less than half the price of something like a Grasshopper. Their customer service was impeccable and Tony is awesome. If you find this post in the future and have questions I will gladly answer them. That's how good the product and support was.

Total cost: ~6000

Grasshopper holds system + LEDs. 

Best system design imo. The holds are legitimately magical. 5 different ways to hold each hold and they are crazy ergonomic. The insallation was a bit rocky. Their instructions and support were manageable, but nowhere near Revival.

Total cost: ~4500

Pads!

Climbing gym near me replaced pads and I managed to pick up 4 x 80"80"4" and a few 60"x80"x4". Bought waterproof mattress covers and then double layered them with waterproof mattress moving bags.  Actually extremely pleased how this part turned out for DIY.

Total cost : ~200 

Slab

I overkilled the slab for sure. 5.5" slab with 24" Footers on each side to guarantee the thing is bulletproof. After doing alot of research, you could get away with ALOT less. Cost was from unlevel dirt to perfectly level slab. Also, I'm in Washington so prices are ridiculous. I feel like I got a really good deal on this in the end.

Total cost: ~3000 

I know this isn't the most inexpensive wall you can get, but in the end it turned out exactly how I wanted it and I didn't kill myself trying to DIY which is worth alot to me in terms of stress. I also think it's basically the best home wall you can get at any price.

Udo Neumann doesn't get enough attention anymore. Here's a video about survivorship bias in climbing talent development.
What’s the best way for me to progress at this point? My max climbs are V8s and highest grade with multiple flashes V6s. I climb indoor only, 3x a week. I currently don’t really do anything outside of climbing other than some casual stuff like playing tennis, table tennis, or hiking.   
  
I’d say my strength is powerful boulders an flexibility ones. Im a very intuitive climber and definitely don’t take time to read boulders enough. Finger strength and body positioning is something that I want to get better at. I also want to get stronger core as I struggle a lot with extreme overhangs. Last thing is that I want to work on strength endurance as I tire easily and have issues with longer boulders.  
  
I hear a lot of people say that the best way to get better at climbing is to us keep climbing. I’m plateauing a bit at the moment so I am getting a bit tempted to do some other stuff.  
  
Would this be a good time to start hangboarding? Or a good time to do some strength training?  
  
Or would you say that it would be good to do some easier climbs and focus on good technique for those, doing them over and over again, and doing campus board and spray wall training?  
  
Edit: I also typically don’t project too too much so that another thing. Are projects important for growth? I’m lucky enough to have a huge gym in my area with multiple locations so there are almost always new routes to try and I get a bit distracted by that.
Supplemental bodyweight exercises Been climbing for a few years now and I'm not trying to break any plateaus or want to get stronger real quick.. but before I started climbing I did stronglifts 5x5. I got extremely strong for my body weight by doing it but after I started climbing, I quit. Since climbing is a much more loveable sport for me.

Though I'm in search for some good supplemental exercises which would be beneficial for my climbing. Not talking hangboards or campus boards (I prefer to climb). Just some support exercises that make your body a bit stronger. Even aside from climbing, I would love to just have a better general body fitness &amp; strength again.

I'm thinking of pullups, pushups and a bit of core to add before or after my climbing day (or different day)? Does anyone have a little scheme or something that I could use?

I'm a slab lover and recently doing more and more overhang stuff. A few years ago I could do a lot of pullups but now only a fraction of that and I feel if I get a bit more general body strength, I might be able to apply this to my climbing. I'm still a big believer that climbing more and training technique is a better way than overtraining with tons of exercises. However, I think supplemental exercises could help the body for preventing injuries because they can be done very controlled.

I was checking out Hoseok Lee's workout scheme but it seemed like a little overkill :D.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!
[Discussion] I got triggered by my friend on the topic of genetics in climbing So my friend read this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/eorsmt/to_all_those_upset_about_hoseoks_opinion_on_his/) about how hoseok lee was able to climb v12 in 3 years and he's convinced every single climber who trains hard enough, eats well enough, trains smart enough will be able to achieve V12 outdoors in 3 years.

His reasoning for why he's stuck at V8 after 8 years of climbing is... well, according to him, he says he's lazy (which is only partly true).

So, I decided to do a lot of research on what people think about the effect of genetics and I decided to quit midway because I started to feel incredibly annoyed at the sheer number of people who unironically believed in something along the lines of *V(high) is possible in x(very small number) years*.

I read a comment that unironically said "V10 in a year is possible for *anyone* assuming they train smart and hard enough". The moment I read that, I couldn't help but feel offended. All *I* thought about in my 1st 2 years of climbing was climbing AND my work ethic proved that, but I was nowhere near V10.

So enough with the rant, why is it that, in literally every other sport that is somewhat popular, pretty much everyone understands the role of genetics, but in climbing, people are so ignorant?

Is it because the sport is relatively new?
Training for sport comps advice I've always been predominantly a boulderer, especially for comps. I'm starting to shift to sport climbing mainly for comps. Partly for a fun change, and partly because I realized my bouldering goals just do not line up with comps. I don't really enjoy the training for a bouldering comp compared to working a single move on a project for 10 sessions. Sport and top rope though, I really enjoy the thrill of trying to flash and how many more moves there are to go wrong.

 Right now, my hardest boulder sends are V10, close to some V11s, hardest sport is 12a inside, top rope 13a inside. I've been taking the high-low approach to training my endurance; one short max strength workout(usually just limit bouldering for 20min), then some sport flash attempts, and a low-end endurance workout like 4-5minutes on the systems board, maintaining like a 3/10 pump. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have good finger strength and pulling strength for my bouldering grade, and I think that's carrying me to good "endurance"- I can make up lackluster areobic capacity by using a lower % of max strength. My goal is to bring my sport flashes up to the mid-high 12s, and send low 13s in under 3 tries.  My general questions would be:

* How can I work on shifting my technique from whats ideal for bouldering to sport? I feel I have trouble flowing through moves rather than approaching the route like 5 boulders
* How should I best structure the longer endurance training? I've been following the crimpd apps are 4x4s, and sometimes 50-50s, both on a systems board.
Building a base vs projecting I want to get stronger and more confident outside, but can generally only climb once a week outside. My gym is bouldering only.

My schedule looks something like:  
Monday: High volume on moonboard or new gym sets (often pretty fatigued this day but I love going to the gym and seeing friends and climbing so idk)  
Wednesday: Strength work (just started this last week), endurance climbing drills  
Friday: Moonboard or gym set projecting (v5/v6)Sunday: Outside, sometimes sport sometimes bouldering (sometimes I can still feel the friday session in my fingers/hands)

I have a few issues with my outdoor sessions, primarily I don't know if my time is better spent working on stuff outside my grade, or just climbing "easy" stuff to get more experience on rock, managing rest, clipping from awkward positions, etc. I also have some head problems around falling, both bouldering and sport, after I took a bad fall bouldering and sprained my ankle very badly last year.

My max sport grade is 5.11a outside, but stuff below 5.10 generally feels really easy and like I am not learning very much. Last weekend I got on a 12a because I wanted to push myself, and it was cool to work harder moves and try a hard crux, and I think I learned a lot, but everything I have read regarding training seems to imply you should build a pyramid like base of climbs before breaking into a new grade. My pyramid would look something like this:

5.4-5.7: 10

5.8-5.9: 8

5.10a/b: 3

5:10c/d: 2

5.11a/b: 1

Should I focus on mileage during my outside climbing, or projects? If mileage, where should I start? Filling in my 5.10s?

PS: I am in central Monterey, CA, about 1 hour from Pinnacles National Park. If anyone has any recommendations for outdoor areas or routes within 2 hours of that area with good sport climbing with clean falls, PLEASEEE let me know. Lots of the stuff I currently climb feels very sketchy to fall on/sparsely bolted.

PPS: Would a coach be worth it for someone in my position? I have been climbing about 1.5 years now.
What are the best No-Hang devices? I've recently had a lot of success following a Lattice rehab plan for A2 pulley strain, which largely consisted of a no-hand density "hang" protocol. I used it as my warm up for climbing sessions, and found that my injury cleared up very quickly and my fingers feel healthier than ever. I've been using a one hand hangboard and a Lattice weight pin owned by the gym I climb at. I don't recall the make or model of the hangboard, it's a very simple, thin rectangular board with a 12mm on one end and 10mm on the other - both very incut.

I'd like to have my own no-hang setup so that I can train at home, which would've allowed me to rehab every day with light weight, and also fills the need for a hangboard since I have nowhere in my rented apartment that I could affix one.

These are the products I think seem to be the best options on the market right now. I've favoured 1-hand vs 2-hand portable hangboards, and leant towards designs that I think will be the most stable in terms of tilt when lifting.

Wrist training is the new hangboarding Lately wrist training for slopers and compression have become all the rage. I think this is mainly sparked by two podcast guests: Yves Gravelle and Dan Varian. In it they discuss how training their wrists has increased their sloper strength dramatically. Apart from these podcasts there doesn't seem to be a great deal of information on wrist training. I'd like to create a compendium of exercises, tools, etc that target wrist strength not from a wrist stability point of view but from a strength point of view. Here is a start. 

**Wrist curls**

* Targets flexors and extensors.
* Easy to do with e.g. dumbbells.
* Doesn't translate perfectly because fingertips aren't pushing against hold 

**Rolling thunder / wrist wrench**

* Targets flexors.
* Have to buy a piece of equipment.
* Same issue as wrist curls

**Weighted supination and pronation**

* Targets ???
* Easy to do with a long stick, weight, sling, etc.

Please let me know about other exercises with possible links to example videos or pictures. Hopefully this will become more mainstream and we might get some data on what good benchmarks are just like we have for fingerboarding.
Keeping tension during deadpoint on near-vertical terrain I am looking for technique advice/cues/drills to keep tension on long deadpoints with the following features:

1. Starting position involves an OK sidepull or undercling, a good opposing foot, and the same-side foot flagging hard against the wall
2. The sidepull is not incut - you can't wrap your fingers behind it to pull directly into the wall
3. The move is almost full-extension and to a hold which is too bad to latch without being very tight
4. The wall is near-vertical (10-20 degrees overhanging)

The best examples of this move are the crux moves from the Solarium in Bishop and G207 in Joes:

[https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/118075626](https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/118075626)

[https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/114079601](https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/114079601)

&amp;#x200B;

I consistently struggle with these moves. Either I pull up too high before moving and start falling backwards immediately when I try to move the hand, or I move dynamically but have sagging hips when my hand touches the hold. For reference: I am a tall and lanky climber, I have been climbing for 7 years, and I can usually send V7 outside in 1-2 sessions.

I do not think that raw core  or posterior chain strength is an issue. I can hold a front lever and deadlift 1.5X bodyweight without much trouble. Rather, I think I have trouble engaging at the right time during the deadpoint. It is also less of a problem on steeper boulders with more incut holds. When the lower hand is more incut, I am able to pull into the wall and oppose that with the feet. to hold tension. However, when the lower hand is bad and the terrain is more vertical I have a much harder time staying tight and moving with precision, because I can't generate inward force using the anchor hand.

Are there tricks for keeping tension when the anchor hand is poor but the feet are solid? What cues would you suggest to improve timing when sticking the move?
Anyone have advice for a novice on how to prevent so much tear during indoor bouldering. Been doing the gym for over 3 months now and it doesn’t seem to be getting better. Non of my other buddies seem to have this issue. Any tips?
Common Misconception of the Climbers Core Recently I have heard more and more people say that they have a strong core because they can do x amount of sit-ups, crunches, etc. For anyone who ist trying to really see core results translate to the climbing wall, it is very important that you don't confuse your whole core with simply your abdominal muscles. Training your core means to improve your overall body tension, and training your abs is only a small part of that. 

**For climbing, specifically, the aim of core training is to keep tension throughout your entire body while doing moves.** It can also help prevent injuries, as your climbing technique will be more robust and you will be able to support your limbs more. 

Climbers core consits of many more muscles stabilising your trunk such as your lower back, hips and shoulders. Personally, I think you could even go so far as to include your legs as you often have to press down hard on the footholds to keep proper tension.

To summarize, you should be aware of the difference between your core and your abdominal muscles and consequently not only train your abs so that you can see more gains translate onto the climbing wall.
Training for long multi pitch sport routes 350m+ Hi all.

I love motivating myself to train and climb harder by having a route or boulder to aim for, but I feel this project may be a little difficult given the timeframe. Myself and a group of friends plan to climb a 440m sea cliff sport route graded 7a+/b (6c with the 7's pitches aided). We have 9/10 months before the trip.

What are the best methods to train for load endurance based routes like this that need to be done in a day?Also, what grade range does someone need to be onsighting and redpointing to get to stand a good chance of climbing it both free and/or aided?Is our given time frame too short for this project?

Our current redpoint grades range from 7a-7b/+, and we all have access autobelays, lead walls, circuit board and good climbing gyms.

Any personal advice on how to approach this or how to psychologically prepare would be appreciated. Below is a little bit about my current and favoured training, and I have added some pictures of the route description with a grade breakdown of the pitches.

\--------

Lead climbing strengths:

Finger endurance, finger strength, mid-route resting.

Climbing limitations:

Struggle with hard powerful cruxes and power endurance heavy sequences on lead.

Relatively weak upper body and shoulder strength for my grade - better with outdoor style problems compared to strong indoor/competition based problems.

\-------

Current training:

Endurance:7:3 Repeaters

Circuit board/autobelay 1 on 1 off / 1 on 2 off (climbing 2/3 grades below indoor flash)

Power Endurance:Occasionally campus board McClures

Strength:20mm max hangsWeighted pull upsPulley/band assisted lock offs.

\------

Weekly Training:

Monday: Warm up -&gt; Moderate/Hard bouldering session -&gt; Endurance 7:3 repeaters

Tuesday: Rest

Wednesday: Warm up -&gt; Easy/Moderate Lead session -&gt; Max intensity endurance circuit session

Thursday: Rest

Friday: Warm up -&gt; Full Strength Workout -&gt; Easy/Moderate social bouldering

Saturday: Warm up -&gt; Easy/Moderate Lead session -&gt; Max intensity endurance circuit session

Sunday: Rest

Any recommended changes to my training plan to better suit my goal would be welcome.

Has anyone had success with "awkward strength" routines? A while ago I took a month to try a cycle of what I called "awkward strength". I focused on working strength in end-range motions of various movements that would mimic climbing.

I came up with the following exercises:

\- pull-throughts. I'd kneel in front of a cable machine with the cable at the top position, so I was starting with with my hand fully extended above my head. I'd grip the handle, and slowly pull it down in front of my body, below my chest until I was pushing the handle down towards the floor. The point of this was to try and increase the strength and awareness of pushing down with the non-moving hand in big moves. For example, the bottom hand in a campus board move.

\- core rotations. I'd set up the cable machine at shoulder-height. Load it up with a pretty heavy weight, then step away with a wide stance and my hands clasping the handle with arms fully extended. I'd then twist my torso away from the machine, working on my core strength in the transverse plane.

\- flags. I worked on human flag progressions (45 degree flags and tucked flags). This seemed like a useful exercise for getting my shoulders and core stronger for lateral movement.

\- hanging rotations. Grab a pullup bar, shrug up into your scapula, and then twist to the left and right as far as you can. Seemed like a useful thing to strengthen my shoulders in these awkward end ranges.

I recently saw this video, which has more examples of this sort of approach to training: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWotveSOBxc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWotveSOBxc)

&amp;#x200B;

So I only did this for about a month, and I stopped because I wasn't really feeling like it was doing much. Maybe I didn't stick with it long enough to see results. I also found that it was a bit tweaky - I was worried about loading the exercises properly to generate a good strength stimulus while not injuring myself in the awkward positions.

Has anyone else experimented with more inventive exercises like this? Care to share your experience?
List of common climbing injuries and how prevent (crowd source) My #1 goal is to never get injured again (still plan to push).

Currently battling a bad back injury and this has got me thinking about how to prevent all future injuries by strengthing and weight training.

My problem was that I never thought to strengthen my back and core muscles. But as I got stronger and better, my backs became the weakest links. I also recently saw a post on wrist injuries am now wondering how common that is?

I wonder if it might be useful to crowd source a list of common to less common injuries and what training one should do.

---
I can start:

Year 1: scraped leg on a slab
Got pants and improved foot technique.

Year 2: started felling neck and shoulder pains, especially with desk job.
Still dont have a solution to this one. Massage, better posture, good sleep help. 

Year 3: pulled muscle/tendon in forearm
Started hangboarding to strengthen fingers and feel confident on holds.

Year 4(current): strained/pulled/tore muscle or tendon in back.
Back is super complex!! Dont try and self diagnose!! Dont climb until pain is fully gone and rehab it carefully. Go see PT. I ignored this advise initially, but now not climbing and planning working towards a slow rehab. Also plan to introduce back and core workout.

What other injuries can I expect and what other training should I introduce into my routine?
Reflections on a successful performance phase (and an open invite for further advice) I just had the most successful 6 weeks of climbing of my life. Prior to this past month, I had sent 5 double digit boulders in 3 years of climbing. These past 6 weeks, I put down another 5 double digit problems and made quick work of any V5-9 I tried. Additionally, my measurables (MAW hangs, one arms, etc.) either improved or sustained during this stretch. 

I am NOT an expert in training or a particularly strong climber, but I did want to make this post to reflect on what I learned so that others can not make the same mistakes I did and can potentially pick up some tactics I found helpful for sending in-season while maintaining or improving strength. Please respond by adding to this list of "in-season, send hard, stay strong tactics" (or feel free to push back against anything on here):

SLEEP AND NUTRITION:

* Prioritize getting 7-9 hours of sleep. Don't let night bouldering (or other less worthy pursuits such as Netflix) prevent you from sleeping enough. I think quality sleep is the most under-prioritized tactic for climbing hard.
* Eat enough. Be particularly sure to eat a lot of protein. Dialing in sleep and protein intake are, imo, the two prerequisites for having the gas in the tank necessary to send hard and complete supplementary workouts without burning out or getting injured. 
* Drink tons of water. I started off everyday by drinking a liter within an hour of waking up. Beyond the cliche "water is healthy" position, water helps with connective tissue health and skin recovery.
* If you want to lighten up, intermittent fast on non-climbing days. When you sit down to eat, I think you should eat as much as your body tells you to - forcing small portions is lame; however, putting your body in a fasted state now and then is both healthy and will keep you lighter. On off days just have coffee or tea for breakfast.

PROGRAMMING TRAINING/CLIMBING:

* Plan week by week. I sat down at the beginning of each week and asked "when will I climb at my limit?", "when will I climb easier?", "when will I train?", and "when will I rest?". I based my answers on the following rules (and obviously my work schedule).
   * I used 2-4 day "work blocks" followed by 1-2 day "rest blocks"
   * Scheme your "rest blocks" to come before your hardest climbing days. And base your hardest climbing days on conditions as much as your schedule allows. So "work blocks" start on days with the best conditions
   * Taper the difficultly of the climbing over the course of the "work block". Project the first day, 2-3 grades below max on second day, and then on the last day or 2, only do easy climbs as you are already kind of beginning to recover for your next "work block".
   * Early in the "work block", do low-volume high-intensity training of climbing muscles. I wrote workouts that included high-effort no-hangs, added weight pull-ups, and front lever work. Keep volume low enough that you don't interfere w climbing, but working these short max-effort workouts into my programming reminded my body that even if my current project didn't demand some specific type of recruitment, it needs to stay strong in that area.
   * Later in the "work block", do mid-volume high-intensity training of non-climbing muscles. Bc you are climbing easier on these days, you can do a longer workout, but still prioritize effort over volume bc you want to adapt the proper power systems for climbing hard. Here I did ring I'd, Y's, and T's, some KB work, dips, pistol squats, etc.
   * During the rest block, prioritize stretching, mobility, and low-intensity cardio (I'd work handstands, go on walks, and do videos from bodyweightwarrior's YouTube)
* No-hangs over hangboarding. I used a loading pin with the metolius block (but tension makes a great one too). This isolates the fingers without fatiguing other muscles and allows you to incorporate pulling strategies that translate well to actual climbing (see Tyler Nelson's work on this)
* Brisk walks before food most days are a great tool to burn excess fat. Much healthier than caloric restriction or hard cardio that is going to interfere with recovery.
* Work prehab into your daily rhythms, but don't do it enough that it becomes a workout in itself. Using a flex bar or some sort of finger extension resistance tool are great to avoid injury, but don't overdo it.

PROJECTING TACTICS:

* Low humidity is often better than low temps. This was a revelation for me. If the morning is 40 degrees with 80% humidity and the afternoon is 57 degrees with 30% humidity, climb your hardest in the afternoon. I sent most my hardest climbs between 11am-3pm; a time frame I used to avoid bc of heat
* Embrace two-day projects over completely wrecking yourself. In the past, if I did every move on a V10, I'd get so psyched and keep trying it for 3 more hours. It'd take three days to fully recover and I wouldn't send anyway because I'd be so tired. Now, on most hard boulders, I spend the first day with the sole priority of perfecting my beta, and then I call it even if I have some energy left (bc I am only on day one of a "work block"). Then, I return and try it fresh with perfect beta. I sent 4/5 of the double digits I did on the second or third burn of my second day trying them.
* Avoid wrecking your skin or extreme pump unless you're on the second to last move of your project. This is another key to being able to climb hard AND train hard without overdoing it. If your skin, muscles, and tendons all have a metaphorical gas tank, this tank doesn't empty linearly. Sometimes you can push it just a little too hard and drain half the tank with 30 seconds of over-exertion, thus demanding 3 days of recovery rather than 1. If you want to climb a V10 on Saturday, and you're having a flash go on a V5 on Thursday and you mess up the beta and you start to get pumped, just jump down and bail on the flash.
* Be mindful of fatiguing certain grip types by choosing climbs with different types of holds. If your project has lots of full crimping, for instance, on day 2 or 3 gravitate towards more open-handed climbs that work different mechanisms
* Choose climbs with the comfiest holds on the last day of your "work block" as this day is like a sort of pseudo-rest day and you want to limit how long your "rest block" needs to be to properly recover
* In order to push grades, I think its best to have projects that accommodate your strengths and climb moderates that improve your weaknesses. For me, if I am going to climb a V11, its going to be steep, but by trying V5 slab, not only am I doing better to recover from that V11 roof I tried the day before, but I am also training for the V5 slab moves that might constitute the end of a V11 roof problem.

OTHER THOUGHTS:

* Get chalk off your hands asap when you are done climbing so that your skin doesn't get dried out
* Leukotape is my preferred tape unless I need friction, in which case just one thin layer of athletic tape with super glue underneath it is preferable. 
* Have a pair or two of try-hard shoes and a looser pair of moderate shoes. This way you don't wear down your try-hard shoes unnecessarily, and your feet won't be crushed while climbing V2s
* Understand that there is a tradeoff between power and flexibility. Sure, some pros can display freaky degrees of both, but generally, that is not how muscle fibers work. Focus on stretching in areas where you need mobility, but limited power won't be an issue (ie. focus static stretching on your lower body (but don't entirely neglect upper body static stretching))

So many other things come to mind, but I will stop here! I'm sure a lot on this list won't work for everyone, but any time a friend of mine doubles their all-time production in one month I think "I wish I knew what tricks they used to do that"... so now that, for once in my life, I am that friend, I wanted to make this post. Excited to see what others would add!
Interesting article on how Aiden Roberts (second ascent of Alphane on 9A) learnt to climb with a clear mind, relying more on subconscious movements
V10+ climbers, what’s my low hanging fruit? Part-time lurker and late 30’s climbing coach here. I’ve set myself a goal of climbing V10 this year, hoping some of you can chime in with suggestions on where I could improve my chances. A few essential stats:

10 years climbing across all disciplines, 5 recent years I’ve focused on bouldering and sport climbing 

Consistent V6 flash indoors and V5 outdoor 

I send a new V7 in the gym pretty much every session 

V7-V8 goes down in 1-3 sessions for me outdoors

The V9’s and 10’s I’ve tried outside have a move or two that I can’t manage in isolation 

I’m 6’1” with an even ape index and 185 lbs

To prepare for outdoor season here, I’ve been training a bit in the gym and have these current stats:

Max hang 10s 20mm + 67.5 lbs (1.36 st:wt) with half crimp

13 pullups at BW

45 push-ups 

One arm lockoff on a bar with both arms for 5s

1-3-5 campus both sides

1-4-6 campus on right side

No front lever

No one-arm pullups

No one arm dead hang on 20mm

Besides the strength metric stuff, I have a decent array of techniques and can send V7 in all styles. However, I tend to climb better on slabs or dynos, probably because of my height. I tend to climb worse on sustained overhangs or in scrunchy sequences. I work at a gym and have access to many V8 and up boulders within 1 hour of where I live, so I’m a weekend warrior.

I plan to work a few V8 and 9 boulders this winter and look for something harder that suits me. Besides that plan, what seems like the obvious thing for me to improve?

Thanks

Moonboard: Cutting feet vs. keeping feet on - why and when for each? Big question and very long post, but what are the advantages and disadvantages of jumping/cutting vs keeping a foot (or both feet) on when climbing the moonboard? Are my thoughts below correct? What insights am I missing? I only climb around V5/6 benchmarks on the 2019 set and so am extremely interested in what stronger people experience at the higher V-grades

&amp;#x200B;

\-Keeping a foot or both feet on: theoretically **unweights the fingers** by some amount relative to cutting, meaning the hand hitting the next hold will ALWAYS require less contact strength to successfully latch and maintain. If you cut, you have to be strong enough to latch the hold and keep your body weight suspended while finding a foot or campusing to another hold. So for a limit move to a terrible hold, keeping a foot/feet on may be the only way I can use it.

\-There are 2 huge caveats however:

1. Jumping/cutting may allow you to hit the hold BETTER. Keeping feet on may let you barely latch the shitty inside edge of a hold with 3 fingers but you may not be able to hold it long or move off it. Whereas jumping may give you the length to hit it exactly where you want in perfect half crimp position. The trade off of a stronger hold position may be worth the cost of more weight on your fingers.
2. The value of keeping feet on is also directly related to HOW MUCH you are unable to unweight the fingers. So a terrible foot far away that you need to span with your entire length will require crazy tension (and energy) but also doesn't provide much benefit (in terms of how much weight you can take off your fingers). It's typically also harder to maintain this tension to get into/out of these positions and often requires more foot moves (than cutting and immediately reestablishing a foot). In this case keeping feet on can actually be LESS EFFICIENT than jumping and cutting

\-Jumping and cutting: as mentioned above, jumping/cutting requires the fingers to deal with more weight. And not just bodyweight, the force on your fingers is mass (bw) x acceleration. And so the more violently you are jumping and possibly swinging, the more force you have to combat with your fingers. But the two main advantages are:

1. MORE LENGTH. There are some moves you simply cannot span when keeping feet on. And there are some moves that are more difficult to span than to jump to.
2. BETTER POSITION for the next move. Sometimes I hit a spanny move and am fully stretched/tensed then have to strain to find a higher foot before awkwardly pulling through from a fully extended arm into a locked off position. I find that if I instead jump hard enough to the hold I can use my momentum to continue through into that much stronger (for me) locked off position before quickly reestablishing that higher foot. This often feels much easier

[https://www.moonboard.com/Problems/View/358202/moon-rider](https://www.moonboard.com/Problems/View/358202/moon-rider)

The above is a good example of when I think cutting is more efficient than keeping feet on (and the vast majority of videos i've watched reinforces my thinking). Specifically the hand move to I13. I can just barely keep my left foot on the starting hold and hit the left inner edge of I13 with right hand 3fd, but to maintain that tension and switch feet on the starting hold so I can then move my left foot to F8 feels impossible. Then I would have to push hard off the left foot to help lock off the right hand. It's so much easier to jump into a locked off right hand on I13 and instantly reestablish my left foot onto F8 and be in perfect position for the next move
Making my climbing app project open-source? What's up!

A few years ago a friend and I started to build a training logging / climb logging app to help climbers track the training they do in a customisable way. It allows logging climbs in all popular grade types and setting additional meta-data such as gradient, hold types and character of the climb. You can also create and follow custom training sessions which can be shared publicly in the app. After logging several sessions there are dashboards that start to paint a picture of the climbers strengths and weaknesses. It's possible to log all types of workouts such as those done in the gym or on a hangboard. The last thing I will mention is the training calendar view which shows a summary of all training on a given day within a calendar. It's really good at showing consistency.

This kept us very busy during lockdowns/COVID times and gathered a fair amount of interest from the community, with some keen users logging lots of training sessions!

Over the past year, we have had less and less time with life and work commitments to really do anything with the project but we still believe it has a future. We had lots of feedback to action and things to improve such as being able to create custom training plans but just simply don't have the time!

One option would be to make it all open source and let the tech enthusiasts of the climbing community own it.

So with this post, I simply want to guage interest in an open source climbing app project.

We have an Android app here https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.super8bit.climbz

There is a simpler iOS app, web app and an API. We would make all of this public and let the community drive its direction.

Edit: Thank you all for your comments and feedback. I will post here again when I have an update to share 🙏
How to go from Boulderer to Lead Climber? **tl;dr: I am a boulderer and my rope (compared) grades is drastically lower and am asking for possible solutions.** 

Hello (First time poster)

First off my background 

* 5'4.5 Asian Male \~150+- 2lbs +3 Ape Index
* Started climbing Dec 15, 2021
* Sprained my right ankle Feb 28, 2022 and couldn't climb with both feet until May 2022. I still continued climbing with 1 leg however. Partial tear on my left shoulder since Late August but still climbing because I can pull but can't push i.e. mantle.
* First V3 (Late Dec 2021), V4 (Mid Jan 2022), V5 (Mid Feb 2022), V6 (Mid June 2022), V7 (Mid August 2022)

I genuinely only Boulder because I am scared of heights like seriously terrified. There's a reason it took be 4 tries to pass my lead climb cert. compared to only needing one try for my lead belay cert. For my first 3 tries (I grabbed rope while falling while the next two I would simply not let go. It took extreme motivation of going to the New River George to outdoor lead a week before to finally fall correctly). I am very goal oriented. My initial goals were to sends V5s and 5.11s by one year of climbing (I surpassed by bouldering goal while struggling on ropes. For bouldering, I can send V5s (1-2 sessions), V6s (1-4 sessions), and V7s (3+ sessions). While on ropes, the **highest I've lead/top rope is 5.10c** and I've flashed the two 5.10cs I've sent. However, there are multiples 5.10as and 5.10bs that I can't flash/send even a couple 5.9s. While on ropes, for me it does not matter whether I am TRing or leading I seriously can't progress. I tried TRing a 5.10c and can't send it. Whenever there's a move where I can't do statically; **I freeze up and just asking my belayer to lower me**. One thing my friend and I notice is that my technique drastically decrease once I pass the 3rd/4th clip. When I do send routes, I get super tired not because of the climb, but because of my heart just keeps beating so fast. I believe I have narrowed my two ultimate problems: **Scared of Heights** and **No Endurance**.

I think the main solution for getting over my fear of heights is to top rope more and actually practice falling on lead (dedicate a session or two just falling; but I feel bad for my belayer for spending a ton of time and effort just to help me) and would like to ask for endurance advice. I understand I overgrip on jugs. 

Thank you in advance.
Pull through on campus board I can very consistently do 1- 4.5 (I have 1/2 sizes) but my pull through is god awful. But practice you say! Ok, yes, well that's the thing. I train my pull through (which by the way, is that even the phrase?) and it's just so fucking slow. My back/shoulders just have a really hard time with that, I'm not sure why. I can do:

On the 32mm and 25mm rungs: 

1- 2- 4.5

1- 3- 4

1- 4.5- 5.5

19mm rungs:

1- 2- 3 

1- 3- 4 

Maybe also helpful to know; my lock off isn't horrible, but there is plenty of room for improvement. I can regularly do 25mm one arm hangs (and 20mm if I'm focusing haha) but my 1 arm lock off is like, non existent. If I was motivated to fix that I'm sure I could get that up to snuff relatively easily, so this is just background. I don't think lock-offs are much related to campusing but I've been wrong more than 100k times in my life, so there's really no stopping me.

I'm basically looking for some body weight or weight training exercises to help because I don't want to campus more than 2x / wk... don't wanna risk the ol' fingers. I occasionally use body/weight training but I'm blanking on exercises.

I have strong fingers and have good technique so it would be great if my back would stop being such a weak bitch so I could get on with it. 

I'm a woman, not that it matters a whole lot, but maybe there are some strong women here that have the secret sauce. Men's thoughts not excluded tho.
RPE training in climbing Had a discussion with one of my friends who is a strength and conditioning coach.

I mentioned that climbing commonly uses 4 week mesocycles, which surprised him.

I mentioned I find I need that deload week every 4 weeks to recover. 

He suggested that it might be I’m doing things maybe a bit too hard for what I’m supposed to be achieving for that session, thus fatiguing quicker and needing that deload week sooner.

Watching the lattice video on RPE Ollie makes a point that, as climbers, we tend to overshoot the difficulty of problems and make them more difficult than the session is intended to be.

What would the RPE of some common bouldering workouts actually equate to?

Using Crimpd app workouts as an example:

-Style Triad (Limit bouldering): RPE 9 ?
-Strength intervals : RPE 8 ?
-Board 10 : 5 Problems RPE 6-7, 5 Problems RPE 9 ?
- 6 in 6 : RPE 8 ?

Etc etc.

What are your guys thoughts on this? Am I barking up the wrong tree, or should we be getting a better idea of how the difficulty should “feel” for different workouts?

And what would you think different “typical” sessions should be in regards to RPE

Thanks all!
Best board for outdoor progress I am currently at a gym where we have a moon board and a pretty quality spray wall. I am debating going to a new gym nearby that only has a kilter board but much better boulder walls (about 4x as much boulder).  I have climbed on a moonboard for the vast majority of my climbing, and only once on a kilter board. Also, I should mention that when I'm at the climbing gym, about 85% of my time is on a spray wall of some sort rather than just normal bouldering walls. 

I am curious about anyone's experience with which one better correlated with progressing outdoors. I'm able to climb outside between 1 to 2 times a week max and in the end my main goal is just to climb better outdoors.

My main concern was switching to a kilter board is the lack of hard crimps. Although I have limited experience on the kilter board, it seems like it lacks the small crimps that the 2016 moon boards have. 

What are your takes on moonboard vs kilter board. And does it seem more advantageous to stick with a gym that has a moonboard and a quality spray wall versus a bigger bouldering area plus a kilter board?
Improving climbing technique when already strong I've been reading posts here for a while now and it's obvious that there is a lot to learn from the members of this community, so here is my attempt at getting free advice :)

**TLDR: How can I improve my climbing (specifically technique) if I'm already physically strong?**

**General**:

* 165cm (zero ape index)
* 68kg +- 1 (low 10s BF%)
* 31y

**Climbing-related** (mostly bouldering)**:**

* First climbed 5y ago, inconsistently through the first 2y
* Now climb 3-4x per week
* Indoors: Max grade V7-8, sometimes flash V5, almost always flash V4
* Outdoors: Max boulder V4, Max sport 6b+
* Max hang 20mm/5s 180% bw (half-crimp)
* Can hang one-arm on 20mm for 5s with -5kg for the right and -10kg for left
* 1RM weighted pullup 180% bw

As I think is clear from the above, both my finger strength and my pulling strength far outstrip my actual climbing ability. I haven't focused that much on training these strength attributes, and mostly do a short strength session before a climbing session in the gym. I can tell that there is no point for me to train them more, because obviously it's not a limiting factor in my climbing.

Because of where I live (moved recently to Cambridge, UK) and my job, I don't have easy access to a crag (2h30min drive to Peak District) during the week and can only go on the occasional weekend. I haven't climbed much on rock in general yet, but this is what I would mostly like to do in the future (not a big fan of modern comp-style boulders, although sometimes they're fun).

I believe that what I would benefit most from is improving my technique. But how? What is the best way? Is it through projecting more? I know that's definitely one thing I have to do and I have started incorporating that into my sessions, but do you have any specific advice in how to structure that (e.g. what difficulty do you go for - is it barely being able to do single moves or easier than that)? Is it through doing specific drills (if so, which ones)? Is it through board climbing? Is it through getting a coach (I feel a bit averse to this, both because of financial reasons, and because I believe that I should be able to progress further on my own)?  Do I try to record more of my climbing (I already do a bit)? I know I would also benefit from having a crew of stronger climbers than me to learn from, but at the moment I mostly climb with my partner who's a bit newer to climbing than me.

Thanks everyone!
My 7.5 year self assessment of climbing, strength training, and hangboard Some of you have asked about when the new one was coming out since the 6 year one was done in 2019. Finally got around to finishing this beast.

https://stevenlow.org/my-7-5-year-self-assessment-of-climbing-strength-training-and-hangboard/

For those who have more time to read you can see how my perspective has shifted over time. 

If you don't want to read the whole thing, here's some of the general summaries.

---------------

**Technique versus muscling climbs**:

Double down on extreme technique practice. Given that I had the experience of going from V4 again to V8+ there are a lot more technique nuances than I thought given my hand strength was down but I could get a lot more climbs than I thought. Any climber in the V0-V10 range should be focusing on finding ways to initiate movement and weight shift with the feet, finding good body positions, and maintaining good tension while minimizing the pressure on the hands. Minimizing the pressure on the hands does not stop your hands from getting stronger because you will get more hand work as grades go up anyway.

My current opinion — Train technique from the beginning if possible for “optimal” results. For ~~“good” (2018)~~ ~~“mediocre” (2019)~~ “poor or terrible” results, muscling through problems works but will definitely come back to haunt you later on even though it can be corrected. This usually requires years of focused training to improve technique to a higher level.

The most fundamental thing to keep in mind through at least V10+ is learning how to maximize the amount of pressure on the feet at all times and minimizing the pressure on the hands. Dragging, pulling in, weighting, rocking over, and finding the right pressure angles on the feet with the right body position are critical to do this.

**The applicability of strength training and climbing schedules**:

Focus on using strength training only as a tool to improve potential weaknesses. If you can get training on the wall to mimic gym training you should do that instead.

**Beginners**: Focus on minimalist strength training if you are a beginner (0-12 months). 80-85%+ of your time should be spent climbing and focusing on technique. 3x a week should be climbing for 1-1.5 hours. As work capacity increases, you may continue to add time but generally stop around when your peak performance starts to decrease. This is usually around 1.5-2 hours and occasionally 3 if rest a long time. Strength training should be at most about 20-30 minutes of strength training 2x a week at most. Focus one leg, one anterior and posterior core, one pull, one push, and face pulls.

**Intermediate to advanced+** — Don’t unilaterally add climbing days or strength exercises. More is not always better. Small changes can break plateaus, and if you have been doing a lot then actually reducing the amount of things you are doing can make you improve faster sometimes. [RP article on volume landmarks for hypertrophy improvement](https://rpstrength.com/training-volume-landmarks-muscle-growth/) which also applies to strength training and improvement in climbing: You want to be in the maximal adaptive volume range and not moving toward maximal recoverable volume which is closer to overuse injuries and overtraining. Strength training should still be at most about 20-30 minutes of strength training 2x a week. If you have specific weaknesses that need more than 1-2 sets you can increase to 3-4 sets.

Strength may be a limiting factor in your training if you cannot lock off around V6-7. If you can do a one arm pullup, you are likely not strength limited until you can do at least V10+.

Adding days: Whenever you want to add an extra training day, take one day and split it in half or take the total volume of the week and divide it between the new days. For instance, 3x a week for 2.5 hours is 7.5 hours of training. If you are going to do 4 days, you can split this into 3 days of 2 hours and 1 day of 1.5 hours. This ensures that you are doing a similar amount of volume so as not to cause overuse injuries. Do not do two high intensity days in a row. Typically, do an intense day followed by a volume day or something similar.

Modulating sessions: Generally, understanding the concept of fatigue is important. Climbing past your ability to peak perform typically rapidly turns into junk volume. You’re at most getting marginally better adaptations to possibly none and negative adaptations as well as drastically increasing your chance for overuse injuries. Once you start losing the ability to perform optimally during a session either you need to terminate your sessions or be careful and focus on eking out better technical improvements as fatigue starts to mount.

**Note: Specific exercises for weaknesses are too long to list and recommended in the article for each of the categories of legs, core, push, and pull exercises**

---------------

**Grade chasing versus grade completion**:

Both grade chasing and being well rounded can work well because they fit different athlete’s various motivations. However, those whose nature is mainly to project can generally benefit a lot more from more volume work in their climbing. There probably is a ~~80/20 (2018) either projecting or volume~~ ~~67/33 or 60/40 either projecting or volume (2019)~~ 25-33% projecting and 67-75% volume split (possibly even 20-80% or more) where you will make the most improvement.

If you’re a grade chaser, spend at least 1 if not 2+ sessions a week working 1-3 attempts on flash level climbs up to climbs you can get in a session and focus on technique and minimizing pressure on the hands. If you can’t get it in 3 attempts just stop and don’t keep trying it because of ego. A dedicated month or two of volume climbing can be effective to break plateaus.
If you mainly do volume then you probably already have a good base and need to start projecting at least 1x a week and possibly up to 2 sometimes if it’s a severe weakness.
I am also cognizant that some people do extremely well with extreme try-hard projecting for several sessions a week. If that’s working for you then keep at it, but usually plateaus I tend to see now seem to be from not building a good enough climbing foundation.

Projecting/limit moves/high intensity: Hard sessions should be trying really really really hard at your limit to make the hard moves. The top climbers have an inherent ability to try hard on almost every attempt. Don’t get frustrated and get sloppy on your attempts. Rest enough to be able to give full effort.

Volume/technique/moderate intensity: Volume sessions should generally be approximately at your flash level focusing on perfecting technique and getting in a variety of climbs. For example, if you project V9-V10 indoors you should be able to flash or few tries V6-8ish. Focus on doing climbs in this spread and give up to about 3 tries max. Don’t let your ego get to you and keep trying climbs you already finished even though you can’t get it one day.

---------------

**The place of hangboard and similar implements in training**:

Focus mainly onto techniques that can keep you on the wall that still work your weaknesses before you try to go to any other supplementing training methods. What I mean by this is if you’re having trouble with say strength endurance, extended traversing might be better than sitting around doing repeaters on the hangboard. You movements on actual climbing which can help build the grip endurance as opposed to just the pure grip work of hangboard.

Of course, hangboard, campus board, and system board and energy system training are good tools to use to break through plateaus in climbing. Likewise, they can be used concurrently with climbing and strength training to make continued progress without plateaus. [Will Anglin’s Hangboarding: A Way goes](https://www.tensionclimbing.com/hangboarding-a-way/) into more detail about when and why these should be used and I generally agree with his conclusions.

Figuring out your specific weaknesses and if they need a pure targeted tool such as a hangboard or if they can be trained with climbing-like methods such as traversing is one of the keys to be efficient and optimized with your training.

---------------

**Holds to train on hangboard**:

Try to avoid hangboard as long as possible and work on various climbs that will improve the grips that you are weak with. 3 finger open climbing for warm-up has been extremely effective without actually having to train 3 finger open on hangboard. Similarly, moving from 3 finger open to 2 finger pockets you can do 2 fingers on jugs in warm ups.

Closed crimping starting on 2-3 climber per session and building up to 3-5 climbs has been effective in gaining crimping strength without having to do it on hangboard. Finger rolls and traversing have been effective for forearm hypertrophy and thus strength without hanging to hangboard, and traversing is more effective for climbing.

If you are going to hangboard, open hand -&gt; 2 finger pockets and half crimp are critical to train. Min edge has some use depending on various goals and climbs on the wall. Repeaters are superior to max hangs in isolation for strength and hypertrophy. Max hangs can be utilized effectively if you have hard crimp climbs during your training session to compensate for the lack of volume. Pinches, slopers, and other variants not mentioned do not seem to have as much use to them. YMMV. 3 main ones to train: half crimp repeaters, open hand -&gt; 2 finger pickets, minimum edge holds or min edge pullups.

Half crimp &gt; open hand &amp; pockets = larger or smaller edges &gt; pinches &gt;&gt; slopers. Full crimp can be added if you have a specific weakness in limited quantities and progressed slowly.

---------------

**Scheduling Sessions**:

Beginners should start out climbing 3x a week. Whether you incorporate S&amp;C and hangboard on the same day is up to you. It can be trained effectively doing either. Adding more climbing days after your body has adapted to 3x a week may also be beneficial if programmed effectively, but sometimes so can dropping back to 2x per week. It really depends on the work capacity, capabilities, susceptibility to injuries, and scheduling of other activities whether or not to add extra climbing days and/or S&amp;C and hangboard on certain days. This is where a solid coach may be useful to help a beginner progress effectively.

Obviously, as you become more experienced, you can experiment with more training days on. However, it needs to be well balanced in terms of recovery lest you develop overuse injuries.

In general, I would suggest someone experiments with more for a bit and then experiments with less for a bit. This will allow them to get a better gauge on whether they are already close to maximal adaptive volume or pushing lower or higher than it.

Added: If you have high recovery and want to experiment moving up to 4-5x a week training,  you can and split the volume apart as necessary. For instance, if you do 3x a week for 2 hours that’s about 6 hours of volume per week. If you wanted to go to 4x a week, you should split the 6 hours of volume into 4 chunks of 1.5 hours. This allows you to spread out the volume which does not put a huge load on the body. Going from 3x for 2 hours to 4x for 2 hours is a 33% increase in volume which start to push out of the sweet spot of decreased injury risk up for acute:chronic workload ratio toward the danger zone. This is not taking into account the fact that there is less recovery with a back to back session which can be brutal on the fingers.

Climbing Deload Weeks There is a lot of controversy and unclarity around the climbing deload week. Although there is still little scientific backing for deload phases in power and resistance training^(1), enough information exists to properly understand the importance of the deload week.

Keep in mind that **taking a one week break from sports will almost never make you weaker**^(2,3,4,5) **but by understanding why you take these breaks in the first place and how you should take them, you will be able to gain more from them.**

# Why should I deload?

Deloading phases have many different uses in climbing.

First off, deloading is used for tapering. The aim of tapering is to maximize recovery while maintaining technique so that you can reach your peak performance when needed^(6). This is very useful prior to climbing trips, competitions or generally any event where you want to be performing at your best.

Deload phases can also be useful for your mental game. If you realise that you are struggling with motivation during trainings, it can be a good idea to cut down on your training. Be careful as this can also have a negative impact on your mentality ultimately demotivating you even more. Experiment with your mindset to see what works best for you.

Stressful periods can be overcome easier through deloading. Sometimes, there can be things in life that are just more urgent than climbing. If you need to reduce training because you don’t have the time or energy you should not feel guilty. It will usually ultimately be better for you, as long as you get back into training after this period has ended.

But if your mental game is solid and you can push through stressful periods, do you still ever have to cut back on training for climbing?

Yes, you should. Deloading phases are super important to prevent injuries^(7). Tendons easily get injured and since they have little neuronal supply^(8), you may not even notice the strain that you are exerting on them until it is too late. If you train a substantial amount, this is the most important reason for having deloading phases in your training plan. If you only train a little, undertraining can also increase injury risk^(9), which would be a reason to stay away from deload weeks. But the training - injury prevention paradox is another very complicated topic that I won’t discuss any further.

Finally, there is one more reason to have less strenuous weeks integrated into training plans:

To understand the last use of deloading phases we must take a closer look at the “Fitness-Fatigue Model”^(10,11). The Fitness-Fatigue Model states that exercise generates two different results: fitness and fatigue. Fitness results are mostly neural and have a dull magnitude but a long duration. Fatigue results are neural and metabolic. They have a large magnitude but a short duration, which is why we can see gains after waiting for the fatigue to recede.

The Fitness-Fatigue Model is often used incorrectly to explain why deloading can be useful^(12). Too many people will reason deload weeks by explaining that performance decreases are simply caused by neuromuscular fatigue and through deloading you will boost your strength because of your fitness will “catch up”. This causes athletes to potentially unnecessarily deload without results because of a performance decrease. However, there is a big chance that a performance decrease is because of other conditions such as stress or lack of sleep instead of actual neuromuscular fatigue.

You should not jump straight into a deload phase simply due to one weak session. With reasoning of the Fitness-Fatigue Model, you should only deload if your performance has decreased over multiple sessions in addition to you feeling tired, worn out and unmotivated, **while all other conditions would not suggest this**. If you are in this state, you have overreached^(13), meaning your neural and metabolic fatigue after-effects are outweighing your fitness after-effects. Consequently, you need to deload.

Experienced climbers can make use of this system by intentionally overreaching prior to deloading so that they can break through plateaus^(14,15). This is called functional overreaching. Hypermotivated and uninformed climbers will non-functionally overreach. They train harder because of performance decreases, leading to dwindling performance. They then refuse to deload because they want to regain their old level. To regain their old level, however, they must now rest an unnecessary long amount of time. If you push even further, the next stage is overtraining. There is lacking evidence that overtraining can even occur due to climbing and if so, it is *extremely* hard to reach. But because scientifical overtraining is such a debated topic and lacks research^(16), I will leave it out completely.

For high level athletes there is scientifical evidence of functional overreaching having a positive effect on their performance^(14,15). Now, if you have not plateaued, there is no evidence that this training will be more effective than simply continuing to train normally. I believe, however, that you can still make great use of this method as an average, non-plateauing climber, since you need deload periods anyways due to the high injury risk. So, why not give it a try? Just watch out you don’t dab into non-functional overreaching.

To summarise:

1. Deloading is useful for tapering
2. Deloading can be used to retrieve motivation
3. Deloading can be used to overcome stressful phases
4. Deloading must be used for injury prevention (except when training volume and intensity is already low)
5. Deloading must be used if you are overreaching
6. Deloading can be used following functional overreaching to break through plateaus

I hope this post could clear up some of the confusion around deloading in climbing.

How to get psyched on rest!? I have this 5.13b project which is basically 2 power endurance routes divided by a helluva good rest (shakeout deep jugs you stay on for about 1-3 minutes). I am falling from the last hard move because I feel super tired there, but not like pumped, more like juiced out, and I feel like I carry this energy all the way from the good rest. When you come into the rest, you are almost about to fall off and the thought of doing another couple of boulders is insane, and even though you can shake out and calm your breathing there quite well, I just always seem to get this super anxiety/depressed feeling when Im in the rest, even if I was psyched under the route. Its just that you know you have to do some hard climbing but also have the time to think about how tired you are and how its all going to fail yet again. I just cant find a way to psyche myself and have this positive flowy energy for the second part, its so difficult to get psyched when you are out of breath and getting heavier - like that feeling after you do a 3rd set of 4x4 and you just sit there like holy shit I have to do this again in one minute.
Relative finger strength vs body weight Hi climbing geek community. 

I’ve heard at several occasion advanced climber saying that because of their body type (tall and relatively heavy) they were not the better candidate for achieving high end finger strength based boulder. 

Now I’m wondering, is there any science/study based knowledge that proved anything like that?

First I’m thinking that, as any climber climb with his own body weight as a base, then finger strength development should be in relation to that, and therefore the heavier you are the more strength you will gain? 
( I’m talking more of finger strength based on the muscle activation, like any kind of crimps, unlike drags that would rely more on passive structure). 

Another point would be that, as a matter of fact, in lifting world, the heavier your weight category, the higher the weight lifted will be. 
So why not here? 
Is there data out there that would help on that for example : max hang as %of bodyweight vs actual weight?

Is then the difference due to the fact that the crimp strength is relying mostly on finger and wrist muscle that are « small » muscle groups and can have limited gain?

Or is it because even in crimp we rely more on passive structure than I think? And those structure are limited at a certain relative weight?

Feel free to correct or add anything I would have missed. 


Cheers
Comment on my climbing plan to improve my mental health (please) **Background info:**

Male, 37y, 93kg

Haven't climbed more than a few times the last year. Due to several factors (family, work etc.) I've been overeating and gained a bunch of weight (93kg now). I was recently put on full time medical leave (mental illness - stress) and I've found that coming back to climbing is helping me recover faster.

**Goal**:

Climb three times per week without getting injured (because I fear it will send me back to square one).

**Plan**:

**Bouldering 3x/week:**

Tuesday / thursday / sunday (Starting with shorter sessions of low intensity / low volumen and gradually increasing).

So far I've been doing all the easiest problems (maybe about 20-25) before working on 2-4 problems that I haven't been able to do yet but will go in a couple of sessions. I'm afraid to push too hard with the intensity.

**Strength &amp; conditioning 2x/week:**

30-40 mins fullbody (1-2 sets of 5-10 reps as per Steven Lows recommendations)

**Mobility / prehab:**

On the non-climbing days I will rotate 20-30 minutes in the evening of either A, B or C:

A: Armaid forearm foam rolling and theraband flexbar exercises for wrist and forearm strength

B: Tom Merrick inspired upper body mobility work with focus on shoulders, wrists and elbows

C: Lower body mobility work inspired by Tom Merrick and Hoopers beta on youtube

**Recovery**

I'm trying to improve on my hydration, sleep and eating patterns as I've read elsewhere that these contribute significantly to your overall recovery.

**Feedback**

Let me know what you think. Is this too much? Is it not specific enough for you to give good feedback? Am I overthinking it? Have I left something important out?

To anyone who made it this far, thanks for reading and I hope you will have something to add.
Over the last couple of months converted a 12x16 shed into a fully insulated home climbing gym with the 7x10 kilter board home wall mainline at 40 degrees
How to choose the correct intensity for training plan and how to balance between outdoor/indoor volume **TL;DR:**

* Question 1: How to choose the intensity of my "project"/limit climbs? 1-3 seshs or 4-8 is fine?
* Question 2: If I could go 3 times per week to the local crag instead of gym would it be better in terms of training? Even if I can only climb twice (30-45min per go) per day? I'd love to hear the story of people that just climb outdoors

**Detailed version:**

* **About me:** 
   * 30yo male
   * Have been climbing for \~2 years
   * V4/5 outdoor and moonboard (usually takes me from 2-5 sessions)
   * 7a+/7b on outdoor sport (usually takes me from 4-8 sessions), which is what I usually call "project"
   * Mostly sport climber since there is no good bouldering crags nearby
* **Goals**: Improve my climbing overall but if I had to choose I'd lean more towards sport climbing since is what I do most
* **Local sport crag info:** \~150 routes, 20-45m long, very vertical and techy, sometimes quite crimpy. 20 minutes from home, can go during weekend and spend the whole day or have 2 good 30-45min attempts during week
* **Local gym info:** Modern boulder area with several angles + moonboard
* **What I've done so far:** Mostly just climbing with occasional max hangs. Usually just goes where the wind blows without any structure

**What I'm planning to do:** Add a bit of structure to my training with proper intensity and volume to avoid injury. Initial idea would be to climb on Tue, Thu and Sat with two options for each day:

* **Tue:**
   * **(Option A) Strength day on the gym**:  20min warm-up -&gt; 40min warm-up on less than flash-level boulders -&gt; 40min limit on moonboard (5-10 min rest between attempts)
   * **(Option B) Local sport crag:** 20min hangboard warm-up at home -&gt; 20min drive -&gt; 40min warm-up go on the project -&gt; 20-40min good effort at "project"
   * Notes on the moonboard: My idea is to use it mostly at 20deg focusing on not cutting feet. Even though I can cope with it at 40deg I usually cut loose a lot, which led me to a few pulley strains in the past due to overuse. Thus, I wanted to start slow first at 20deg focusing on body tension and keeping my feet
* **Thur:**
   * **(Option A) Not-so-fingery day on the gym:**  20min warm-up -&gt; 40min warm-up on less than flash-level boulders -&gt; 40min bouldering on V1-3 sesh but avoid crimpy ones (5-10 min rest between attempts)
   * **(Option B)** Exactly like Tue's local sport crag
* **Sat**:
   * **Sport crag day:** Either local crag or another nearby one. Usually 2-3 routes in a day, either project-level or routes I can do in one to two seshs. 

**Questions:**

* What's a good rule of thumb to choose the intensity of my "projects"? I remember reading here some time ago (couldn't find the post) someone saying that 60-80% of the time should be spent on climbs that take 1-3 seshs to complete but my projects are usually 4-8 seshs. Is it fine or should I aim for something a bit easier?
* My intention is to basically default to Option B (outdoor) whenever possible but is it ok for development? Has anyone faced a similar situation and managed to grow by only going outdoors even if it's just two climbs per day?
* Most of my days are doing hard/challenging stuff for me, which probably stimulates strength gains, whereas for endurance and power-endurance I was planning to get it only from the crag. Does it sound feasible or should I change Thurs for endurance day?

I know these questions are very generic and super hard to answer but I'd love to hear the personal stories of people that have been climbing for longer time than me. I thank you kindly :)

Although contact strength is not (yet) necessarily a scientifical term, it is widely agreed that it refers to the capability to grab onto a handhold upon initial contact^(1). To find out what kind of strength this is and train it, we must take a deeper dive into what exactly determines this initial contact force.

The velocity of force output has been thoroughly researched for many sports^(2,3). The importance of velocity in comparison to the total amount of generated force is represented on the force-velocity graph below. If it is simply in our interest to generate maximal force (strength), we will have a low velocity while doing so (for e.g. powerlifters who should actually be called “forcelifters”). If it is simply in our interest to generate speed, we will not be moving a lot of force (for e.g. sprinters). A strong climber usually falls into the region of power. This is because we need a mix of power/ speed-strength (fast, low-force movements like a dynos) and strength-speed (slow, high-force movements like grabbing a small crimp).

[Force-Velocity Curve](https://preview.redd.it/jpioal1ik51a1.png?width=448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7129f2fd8c6bb29ef6854c35cea17b4ea3efb3f)

From all of this we can derive that **contact strength is determined by strength-speed**. Further evidence to support this is that boulderers, who generally need more contact strength, have been found to have higher velocities with added weight showing higher developed strength-speed^(4). Take a look at the graph below to make sense of this all.

Now, we must develop our strength-speed to gain explosive contact strength, meaning we can generate maximum force in minimum time^(5). Be careful not to confuse explosiveness with explosive strength, which is the rate at which you can produce force after a weight is in motion (see graph below), for example mid swing on a dyno. This is not important to train for contact strength. Also, don’t confuse it with power, which is not only about force but also distance. For contact strength, we do not move which is why it technically does not fall under the category power. I don’t know why people complicated these names so much! It causes lots and lots and *lots* of confusion. You can research for ages without finding a proper understanding of this topic, so don’t be afraid of taking a second read to understand this here.

So how do you improve strength-speed? You guessed it, that needs some further explaining :)

Explosiveness is measured through something called rate of force development (RFD)^(6). This measures force over time throughout an exercise. To catch a hold and put force onto it we probably only have less than or around 200 milliseconds before we fall off. Therefore, we must do everything we can to increase our rate of force development for strength-speed during this initial time period of under 200 milliseconds. **To improve this and gain contact strength, we have to train what we call our starting strength and our acceleration strength**. The starting strength is how many effective motor units we can instantly recruit, and the acceleration strength is how much force we can output before we actually actively pull our bodies upward. This graph below helps to explain this better. Think of the load as your body and the weightlifter as your forearms.

[Detailed Force-Time Curve](https://preview.redd.it/60fbhfpmk51a1.png?width=1245&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76971ffd158429e8f0935093d4f26854a323f35a)

*(Side note: Generally speaking, contact strength is a form of deceleration, but it is cumbersome to explain it with “deceleration strength” since that is generally understood differently.)*

# When (not) to train Contact Strength

You can really waste your time if you focus on training contact strength when you should actually still be training other things. Next to unnecessarily putting yourself at a higher risk for injury^(7) and neglecting other weaknesses, there is another important reason.

We cannot train our muscles to have maximum explosiveness and maximum force (strength) at the same time, since our muscles have limited capacities^(8). Improving explosiveness can conflict with maximal force if we start shifting focus too much. Therefore, training too much contact strength could also be conflicting to a climbing style relying on control and tension. **Don’t think about contact strength as the only and most important mean to improve climbing, especially if bouldering is not your focus**. Specific training for contact strength is only needed by advanced climbers who see it as limiting, otherwise it is not efficient. See the graph below for more clarity about the relationship between RFD and force output.

[RFD Curve Training Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/ypga9n5pk51a1.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1b464b23af99080a613aa4ffe0e312e9a83cf8d)

Make sure that your limiting factor is contact strength rather than maximal pulling force before starting training. By training maximal pulling force, you can barely go wrong anyways since your contact strength will also increase^(9).

Age and Recovery Simply put, when did you notice age slowing you down? I don't mean the cases of someone 40+ climbing hard, but when your own recovery seemed to slow.

For context I am about to turn 37 and have been climbing since I was 32. My training and climbing is obviously different than when I started, but I am fortunate in that I have logged every single climbing session I have had as an adult and can clearly see the drop off in terms of Max Recoverable Volume and Max Sustainable Volume. Basically I can't do as much of a specific modality and still see gains, but I might need more rest days on average or have to lower my volume by a notable amount.

I noticed this start to happen when I hit 35, but have really noticed it the last 2 years. I'm still seeing progression in climbing, lifts, mobility, etc. but pay a higher penalty when I overdo things and find myself riding the edge between "enough" and "too much".

For reference I have 1 child (20 months old) but he has slept 12hrs a night since he was 2 months, I work mostly at home, don't really have a stressful job. Even in 2020 I could manage 4 days  week (usually 1 outside, lower volume), but now I'm pushing it if I do EOD. I'm fairly good about making sure I leave a little in the RPE tank and am experienced enough to know my former response to similar workouts. Mostly a boulderer so things like aerobic climbing/high volume work isn't in the picture. My other hobby is skateboarding.

So other aging climbers- when did you notice aging influence your MRV and/or impact your climbing and training? How did you alter things and what trends have you noticed?

Edit: I'm not expecting or looking for a quantitative answer or to troubleshoot my own program. It's obvious that the low hanging fruit like sleep, diet, and program design play a role, but with age comes a lot of physical and non-physical changes. I've personally found it useful to not expect that I can inherently handle programs designed for younger and/or elite athletes. I'm still building strength, but the process is less linear and predictable. Being more patient helps but so does getting nuggets of wisdom from others' experiences.
Low rows, better use of time than weighted pull-ups? I was watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeJc34LZIWI) video of Pete Whittaker doing some of the lattice strength tests, and I was a little surprised to see that his weighted pull-up absolute 2 rep max was 45.5kgs, a weight I could do at least 5 clean reps of. My first reaction was 'great, I guess I have more than enough pulling strength, time to focus on other things', but then I saw him do the low row test where he did 47kgs for 5 reps in each arm, I can barely do 3 with 40kgs (probably more like 2 if I'm being strict). 

I thought this was interesting because I'd assumed that a big weighted pull-up would automatically mean great pulling strength for climbing, but the transfer to low rows is obviously not as direct as I had assumed, and as Tom says in the video, for a lot of climbing styles the low row is more relevant than the pull-up.

Maybe this is something you all already know, but I feel like climbers are always talking about their weighted pull-up, or how many one-armers they can do, and doing a million pull-ups every training session, with much less attention to rows. Is this an oversight? Or am I just overthinking?
No progress on the hangboard, but progressing through grades? Just did a few tests on the hangboard and compared my results to me a few years ago. 
Me 2 years ago: i hanged with + 32.5kg (66BW) on a 20mm edge and back than my hardest route was 8a. My bouldering level was around 7A+/7B.
Me today: i hanged with 35kg (66BW) on a 20mm edge and today my hardest route is 8b+. My bouldering level is around 7C/7C+. 
(All testing hangs are done in half crimp) 

I really don't understand these numbers, because my climbing has progressed sooo much and on the wall and rocks, my fingers feel much stronger today, but there is soo little improvement on the hangboard.
My numbers are definitely lower than expected for the grade i climb, but at the same time on the wall i feel like finger strength is one of my biggest strengths. I perform much better on straightforward crimp pulling than anything else. 

Also i can hang for something like 15 seconds on a 6mm edge and my friends that can hang on a bigger edge with more weight, can't even touch the 6mm edges. 

Should i really care about performance on the hangboard? Is it really that specific? Should i try to improve on the weighted hangboarding?
Anyone tried L-Arginine or L-Citrulline for Tendinopathy? There seems to be comprehensive preclinical and clinical evidance that Nitric Oxide (NO) promotes tendon healing. Therefore it seems like supplemental NO enhancers like L-Arginine or L-Citrulline could be beneficial as well. However, I could not find any report of someone that tried those specifically for tendinopathy yet. Any experience or opinion on that?

Here some evidence summarized:

&gt;"The use of NO has been investigated in several experimental and clinical settings on different types of tendinopathies, and it has been administrated clinically through a transdermal route. Paoloni and colleagues demonstrated the beneficial effects of glyceril trinitrate (GTN) patches on elbow extensors tendon ([**McCallum et al., 2011**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00186/full#B32)) and on Achilles' tendon ([**Paoloni et al., 2004**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00186/full#B40)), with improvement of pain and function at follow-up, especially in reducing tenderness and increasing muscle's peak force and total work. Comparable results were obtained by [**Steunebrink et al. (2013)**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00186/full#B51), evaluating GTN application plus eccentric exercise for patellar tendinopathy. Double-blinded randomized trials (RCTs) have been conducted to assess whether NO is useful in tendinopathy. Specifically, [**Paoloni et al. (2003)**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00186/full#B39) investigated 86 patients with chronic extensor tendinopathy at the elbow, undergoing to rehabilitation plus either topical NO application in the form of GTN patch or placebo. Those patients from the treatment group showed significantly reduced pain at 2 weeks, as well as reduced pain during activity, reduced tenderness at the lateral epicondyle at 6 and 12 weeks and increased wrist extensor mean peak force at 24 weeks. In a further study ([**McCallum et al., 2011**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00186/full#B32)) a subset of patients from the original trial was follow-upped at 5 years, and patients from the treatment group did not score better than those from the placebo group. In a double-blinded RCT on patients affected by Achilles tendinopathy, two groups were compared, either undergoing to rehabilitation plus either GTN patch or placebo. The treatment group demonstrated significantly reduced Achilles activity pain at 12 weeks, reduced night pain at 12 weeks, reduced tenderness at 12 weeks, decreased pain scores with the hop test at 24 weeks, and an increase in ankle plantar flexor mean total work at 24 weeks ([**Paoloni and Murrell, 2007**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00186/full#B41)). The same patients were further assessed at 3 years, and the results showed as 88% of patients with GTN treatment were asymptomatic at 3 years compared with 67% of patients treated with tendon rehabilitation alone ([**Paoloni and Murrell, 2007**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00186/full#B41)). " ([https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00186/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00186/full))
Are my muscles too strong for my connective tissue? I (m28) have been climbing for around 8 years, very consistently for the last 3. I've got good foundation of sports and general fitness, particularly upper body strength. 

As I've tried to train specifically for climbing I've of course focussed on my forearm max strength and endurance. My muscles have responded well to handboarding and hard bouldering. I've seen improvements particularly in the last year with my max lead and boulder grades improving by full number grades. However as my strength has increased, I've begun sustaining more small finger injuries. I had an A2 strain in one finger during summer, and I was careful to rehab it using a Lattice training plan, and I found that was really effective and left me with what feels like a happy and healthy finger. I'm noticing though that other fingers are starting to suffer, despite having gone through the same rehab routine. It feels like I'm muscularly capable of exerting the force necessary to pull hard on the small holds on the harder boulders I'm trying, whether set by my gym or on the moon board, but my connective tissues aren't able to keep up.

I know any questions about general finger strength would be white noise on here, but I'm specifically looking for resources or tips aimed at strengthening the connective tissues in my fingers gradually over time. I know that they have poor circulation and as such respond slowly to stimulus, but right now it just seems like if I want to break through the grade plateau I've been at for the last few years, which I know I'm capable of doing, it's almost inevitable that I'll get a finger injury. I'd love to be able to make slow, steady gains, it's so rewarding seeing progress on grades that've felt out of reach for so long. It feels like my muscular capacity both in terms of max output, and endurance have improved, but my connective tissues really haven't adapted enough, or even at all.
Rehabbing a MCP Injury: My Experience Edit For those on mobile: The picture is from Steven Lows article and points to the PIP Joint. This post is about the joint below that, on the base knuckle.

Obligatory disclaimer: This is not medical advice. The opinion of a trained professional has always more weight than this post. Consult one if you're not 100% sure, if this could work for you. If you use my rehab exercises and the injury does not get better or even gets worse: STOP and consult a professional. Never during any exercises, I pushed them until I felt pain.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't find much information about rehabbing a MCP injury, so I decided to write about my experience of doing so in the hopes, it might help someone in the future

**What was the injury**

I suspect an inflammation in the MCP joint (base knuckle) of my left index finger. It had no swelling, so it could also be just an overuse injury.

There was no pain when doing nothing, but when I pushed between my index and middle knuckles and towards the lower end of my index knuckle, I felt it. Also, the pain sharpened when I pushed my index finger outwards, like doing a peace sign and stretching beyond that.

While climbing, I felt it during full crimps and heavy half crimps. No pain while open hands.

**What aggravated the injury**

It started while projecting a slab with a sidepull-crimp over my head. I suspect it was the rotational force on my knuckles due to the crimp being above me.

**The Timeline of my rehab**

Injury happened on 21. September. It wasn't that bad, so I kept climbing for about a week. Then I noticed, that it rather got worse (duh). I had a trip to Fontainebleau approaching, so I wanted it to be healed until then.

I rested fully, without any climbing or anything that puts pressure on the finger from the 29th to 7th of October. After that, the pain didn't really get any better (atleast it also didnt get worse). I also asked in our Simple Questions &amp; Injuries thread, if anything had experience with this kind of injury. u/eshlow was so kind to answer:

&gt;Pain in/around the joint usually PIP synovitis stuff usually helps:  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://stevenlow.org/beating-climbing-injuries-pip-synovitis/](https://stevenlow.org/beating-climbing-injuries-pip-synovitis/)  
&gt;  
&gt;Avoid  things that make it hurt for a couple weeks, do lighter climbing, and  try some of the rehab stuff in there to see if it helps

So for the next two weeks, I tried the following things:

In the gym:

* [Finger Rolls](https://stevenlow.org/finger-rolls-for-climbing-hand-strength-and-hangboard/)
* Light Hangboarding with 3-finger drag and full crimp
   * I used Eric Hörsts 7:53 protocol for this with three sets (first 3-fd, second full crimp, third 3-fd)
   * For the intensity of the full crimp, I kept my feet on the ground and kept loading until I felt the lightest pain, then I dialed back a bit and therefore stayed just below the pain-threshold
* Low Intensity bouldering with strict three finger drags only. If I couldn't do a climb without half/full crimping, I wouldn't do it. No pinching (because it's basically half crimping + thumb)

At home:

* No hangs with the Lattice Mini Bar and a resistance band. I didn't have a protocol for this. I just did very low intensity no-hangs for about 20 seconds in 3-finger drag and full crimp a few times per day while working (home office was a blessing)
* Slight massages and stretches

After those two weeks, the injury wasn't fully healed, but got MUCH better

On the 24th October, I went to Fontainebleau. I was a bit scared to go hard at first and suspected, I would just recklessly load the fingers and push through the pain for the two weeks in Bleau, because I didn't want to only climb submaximally.

But I was lucky, we went to Bleau and not to Magic Woods or pretty much any other area. The reason is simple: It's Slopercountry. The whole trip, I didn't have to full crimp anything. Even the half crimps were pretty open and for slapping the big fat slopers, I was always in an open position. I was only experiencing pain when purposefully testing if it was still there, but never while actually bouldering.

So I came back and the joint felt better than before, albeit still not fully healed. I took the week off climbing, because my shoulder was slightly overused in Bleau and I continued with the no-hang protocol at home.

This was the final straw for the injury and the finger feels good ever since. I started heavy hangboarding again and even during full crimps, there's no pain anymore. I'll continue with the no-hanging for a bit though, to make sure it doesn't get aggravated as quickly again.

**What do I think worked and what didn't?**

Again a disclaimer: What worked for me, might be different for someone else. This is N=1 and therefore not very reliable as a study.

Let's go in order of what worked best to what didn't:

* Hangboarding &amp; No Hangs
   * I kept the load very low and without feeling any pain.
   * For the full crimp, I used 20mm with feet on floor.
   * For the 3-Finger Drag, I used a 14mm edge on the hangboard (7:53 protocol) and 20mm for the no-hang (20-30seconds). 14mm worked for me, because I could hang much longer on it (probably around 20-30 seconds). So you might want to use a larger edge if you cant hold as long or keep your feet on the ground.
   * I suspect it worked best for this, as it increases blood flow in the area and stimulates recovery. The load has to be low enough so that the joint can handle it without much effort.
* Low Intensity Bouldering with only three finger drags (below max flash grade)
   * Same reason as above. It's easy to go overboard with this though, so be careful!
   * You might be able to gradually increase intensity. I had high intensity sessions in Bleau (again: haven't done any full crimping), but I was aware of the risk that this could backfire HARD. So if you don't have a good reason to increase the intensity: Don't (see last point for further experience)
* Finger Rolls
   * I don't feel like this helped at all. I stopped doing it regularly at some point and the recovery curve still stayed the same with the hangboarding/no-hangs. It might be a good rehab exercise for PIP injuries, but for the MCP joint, I felt it didn't work. Might be different for you though.
   * It also didn't make it worse, so it could be worth to give it a try. It's also a generally good exercise, but in my opinion not the best choice for rehabbing this kind of injury
* Stretching and Massaging
   * I felt like it actually got slightly worse every time I did this, so I stopped doing it after 2 or 3 times. I can't explain why though. Maybe did too much?
* Bouldering with half crimps
   * I got frustrated only bouldering submaximally, so I had one session too early into rehab, where I half crimped too much on too hard boulders (max flash and slightly above). I felt that this set me back a few days of rehab. I don't think I have to explain why, that seems obvious
   * So as I said above: Be careful when you increase intensity too early or too much. Better stay away from hard climbing a bit longer. One Session of harder bouldering will not be worth the extra week(s) of needed recovery! (!!!)

**Conclusion**

I became a big fan of no hangs for recovery. You can do it multiple times per day with very low intensity, which I felt made the biggest difference in recovery. Light Hangboarding and submax climbing were good for me as well in this scenario.

Anything else I felt didn't make much of a difference. Increase intensity with caution and stop doing anything that hurts you or makes you feel worse once you get cold. As I said, this was my (!) experience and could be different to yours

**Limitations**

I listed most of the limitations above, but as a summary:

N=1 and this is not written by a professional. I'm just a guy interested in climbing hard and gathering information about anything related to that, but I'm not trained specifically for that. So if you have a similar injury and want to try what I did, be cautious and listen to your body. When in doubt, consult a doctor!And as I said in the beginning: I had no swelling or anything you could see. If it's swollen, please be extra cautious if you attempt anything listed here. I would highly advice getting a professional diagnosis and rehab plan in this case.
You don't need a hangboard. How body awareness can compensate for slightly weaker fingers. **Edit: Title is a bit off. Hangboards are good but don't default your training to a hangboard. Better title: "Don't run to the hangboard. How body awareness can compensate for slightly weaker fingers."**

I've said it before and I'll say it again. My fingers are not my strength. Here is a story explaining why I'm not prioritising hangboarding or other specific finger strength training at the moment even though that might bump my climbing up a grade.

The bulk of the problems I like to climb share a common feature. I theoretically have the strength to climb them but for some reason or another haven't figured out how. So jumping from a poor handhold to another poor handhold very often isn't on that list. Problems that are on the list are those which have moves I can "almost" do. E.g. I can hold both the starting position and ending position. I can move from the starting position and preferably slightly engage the next hold, I feel like I have some wiggle room in the end position. If, for all moves, all three are satisfied I am pretty certain I can do the boulder. The only missing piece is a better (not just stronger) climber. So how do you do that?

It's impossible to distill everything that goes into climbing movement in a single post. As per the title I'll talk a bit about body awareness and how to apply this to your own climbing.

First you need a decent understanding of what goes into a move. If you find that difficult simply focus on fingers, feet, hips, shoulders vs chest, bent vs straight arms, engaged vs relaxed core, path between positions. Then you try figure out what these parts were doing when you fell off. Try to find out which of these was most likely to be the culprit and then how the others might have affected that. Someone with great body awareness does this very quickly and then manages to apply it almost without failure.

Here's an example. Check out this climb: [https://youtu.be/lZA2diremEg?t=980](https://youtu.be/lZA2diremEg?t=980) (and by all means watch the entire video). The guy fails on the last match and in the video is explained why that might be. Going through our list we see that the feet failed. During the final match it's clear the core is completely relaxed and his chest is much more engaged than his shoulders are (his back is convex). What needs to change is that his shoulders need to be engaged (i.e. a more concave back) so that he can engage his core better and put his foot down.

Now if you're constantly climbing with better climbers you might get such advice regularly. If you mostly climb by yourself you can do still use all of this. Instead of getting the correct answer from one of your friends you can experiment and see how affecting each factor influences the outcome. Who knows, you might even find yourself on top of the boulder.

Eventually you'll get a longer list then the one I gave and it will also become less binary, i.e. 'relaxed vs engaged' will become a scale of 'how much did I engage'. Even better is that if you make a mental note of what aspects fail more often you can direct your training. The outcome of that might legitimately be that you need stronger fingers if changing every other factor in climbs is "easy" but still its always your fingers failing you. To come back to why for me it this isn't the answer. I still find that most often my fingers failing isn't only due to weak fingers. Just this week I did a boulder with my weaker fingers by simply dropping a foot, which allowed me to engage more of my lower back, which in turn allowed me to get my hips over a foothold releasing some more weight from my hands. (Someone not used to this might never try to release a foot to get more weight on your feet.)

Most importantly though. Keep having fun. If you're not having fun anymore force yourself to make it fun. If that doesn't work then go try something else for a bit.

Maybe something to try: Can you figure out how the same climber might make this position less strenuous? I think slightly disengaging the left arm to lower your centre of gravity allowing him to pull more with his right foot and have the right hand (on a good hold) take much more of the weight.

**Edit 2: Wow, okay. Didn't see that many downvotes coming but I think I agree with some opposing commenters. To clarify some more: There is finger strength and functional finger strength. You can't train the latter on a hangboard but is the one you need most for climbing. Your finger strength puts an upper limit on your functional finger strength. But so does upper body strength, technique, movement vocabulary, etc. Training for climbing isn't simple and we all know it. If you find for yourself you the best way to increase your functional finger strength is by hangboarding then I will 100% stand by that decision. What I told here can make sure that it is the right decision at that time. For me training functional finger strength can be done by mainly just trying hard boulders.**
Need advice to improve at dynos Hey, I am looking for advice to train specifically for dynos.

I recently injured a lumbrical and cannot do anything finger intensive for a month or two, thought it would be a good occasion to train one of my weaknesses.

I live near Font and have done a few "hard" dynos recently (Smash, La Déferlante, Le Danseur, Mortel Transfert), but I still feel like I'm bad at jumping and it's basically my 189 cm (6'2") height that carried me. I want to improve my jumping power. For example I have a slightly shorter friend who has done Froggy Dick in a few tries but I still haven't managed to send it despite spending two full sessions trying. I feel like I have my coordination technique dialed but I struggle doing the final push with my leg to reach the top hold, especially when using a very high foot like in Rainbow Rocket. I basically just stand up on my foot and then fall back down. Not sure if it's a matter of trusting the feet or just a lack of jumping power.

Anyhow I thought it would be a good idea to train my jumping power but I have no idea how. I suppose squats or pistol squats are not the best as they train pure strength and not power. Should I do some kind of jumping jacks? How to simulate properly the situation where the foot starts at the same height as my hands and shoulders before the jump?
Questionnaire about pulley injuries. I'm doing a statistical research on pulley injuries for my bachelor's degree in Sports Science, and I need some data. Hope it's okay that I post it here. It takes 2 minutes to fill out, and it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! (Repost from /r/bouldering) &lt;3
Why (if true) are spray walls superior for training as compared to commercial walls? Ondra, Garnbret, and Woods have all recently said they rely almost exclusively on spray walls (or boards) for training. It seems to be working for them. 

I rarely get on my gym's spray wall because it is in the basement and it would mean giving up on socializing, which is a big part of why I climb. However, I find I make no progress on finger strength unless I hang board. A young guy I know recently made major impressive progress. I asked him how, and he said: "Mostly just limit climbing on the spray wall." 

I thought I was "limit climbing" on the commercial wall, but it is just not having this effect on my strength. Do you have any insight on the difference? Is it the kind of holds they tend to use or something? Or the kind of problems they tend to set?

(One explanation may be that I tend to focus on figuring out the "crux" of the problem I'm working on, rather than starting from the beginning each time. Perhaps this leads to me spending too little time on the wall before I tire myself out).
Cross body tension and weird high feet? Forgive me for using instagram videos, it's where people post Kilterboard climbs. 

I noticed something weird when I was reviewing [my beta for this climb](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CkcQwHQjsPh/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) - literally everyone else uses the other foot for this move. [Like](https://www.instagram.com/p/CfDO26xDfGv/?igshid=NTdlMDg3MTY=) [actually](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CcQVW0WlnjN/?igshid=NTdlMDg3MTY=) [literally](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CYPzHS2h9gD/?igshid=NTdlMDg3MTY=) [everybody](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPgW1KXlAfn/?igshid=NTdlMDg3MTY=) [else](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHxWbpgFwuu/?igshid=NTdlMDg3MTY=). To be clear, I'm talking about the third move out right to the good crimp. I have my right foot on the foot hold, everyone else has their left. Is it a height thing? I tried it with my left foot on the hold and it just felt terrible moving out right because I found myself swinging backwards after I hit the hold, which popped me off. Should I work on my core tension? Does it have something to do with cross body tension? I'm super confused what's going on here and why it feels easier for me this way and everyone else does it a different way. 

For context, this is Levitation on the Kilterboard. At 50 degrees, it's supposedly V10.
What are the most valuable exercises to do when training alone? I've been climbing since I was 14 (I'm 20 now) although I didn't climb for two years. Nowadays I climb around V12 and can sometimes do V11s on the moonboard in one to two session. Now the problem is that I've moved to a new city where there is no one that climbs remotely close to what I climb (the best locals climb around V5). 

 I've been trying to understand what I need to work on to improve my climbing even more so that I can maybe make a training program. 

I've noticed that most climbers that climb around my level all can do 2-3 one arm pullups while I can barely do 1 without actually locking it off. 
I've also noticed that most can hang with one arm in 20mm holds but can't do that either. 
So I've come to think that I can definitely improve my strength. 

Now the question is, should I do weighted exercises like weighted pullups/hangboarding, or should I focus on more climbing volume?


Nowadays my workout includes 3-4 days a week on the moonboard trying the hardest routes I can and then after climbing doing 1 campus on one of the days day and 1 bench press/ weighted pullups on another. It seems to me that raw climbing isn't going to get me further.

Keep in mind that the gym I'm in is a local one in which we have a moonboard, a 1-8 campus, a bench with a barbell and a spray wall which I rarely use since I don't really find creating my own problems usefull.

Thanks for the help in advance.
Hey everyone!! I’m Kyra Condie, for those who don’t know me I’m a competition climber and Olympian and I recently started a podcast with Allison Vest, my long term friend and amazing outdoor boulderer (first Canadian woman to send v13 and v14). Let me know what you think! New episodes on Mondays!
Climbing gym anxiety Apologies if this isn’t necessarily the right sub,  but climbing doesn’t allow text posts and i feel like my anxiety is a roadblock in my goal of climbing harder 

I hope I’m not the only but how do you guys cope with anxiety in the climbing gym? Sport Climbing has become one of my favorite outdoor activities along with snowboarding. As much as I’d like to climb outside often due to location I’m relegated to climbing (bouldering only) indoors most of the year. The gym is nice and all but I already suffer from mad social anxiety which makes climbing inside hard to enjoy. Most of the time I avoid the main walls since there so crowded and relinquish myself to the board area because not a lot of people are there although the times where it is crowded ends with me mostly sitting on my phone and leaving early

It sucks cause I really like climbing but social anxiety has ruined my enjoyment of the sport. And I know how everyone says everyone is nice and all the climbing gym but compared to a regular gym where instead of everyone mostly focusing on their workout everyone’s just crowded around a small area and just watching you makes it hard to even perform.  I feel like everyone is silently judging me when they most likely aren’t but it’s hard to get that thru my head. My  breathing gets heavier heart rate goes up the whole shebang. 

Maybe I need to see a therapist but I’d like to hear advice from you guys

Edit: appreciate all the suggestions guys, though I haven’t replied to anything I’m reading and considering everything. Appreciate it a lot
The Joy Question – another bloviating philosophical essay with nothing to say about high-angle crimping or coordination dynos
Can somebody explain to me why we need sessions where we don't try hard / limit project? From May to August, I trained on the moonboard and climbed every other day consistently. Although my intention was to try hard every session, my body wouldn't allow me to put in max effort because one day of rest in between was not enough. Only looking back did I realize this. I ended up having to do a lot of problems that were not max effort or just wasted energy not making any progress on my projects most days. However, from August to now, because of classes, I took a lot of rest days and probably only climbed 1/4 days on average. Although the college campus bouldering wall is pretty limited, the setters are very strong and consistently put out hard problems, so I usually warm up on the easier new sets, and then stick to one or two problems and project those for the remainder of the session. I'll almost always walk away from the session having made progress on my projects. I feel like I can climb max effort every session. I hear a lot about having volume/technique days, but it seems that this routine of taking longer rest days and projecting every session has yielded a lot of results. If my intention is to get better faster, is there any benefit in changing this and incorporating something else like volume/technique drill days?

Some background about me: I started climbing 1.5 years ago and I projected v6's on the moonboard from May to August, and I can usually put down v8's that are in my style in 1 or 2 sessions now.
Strength/power for a weak sport climber I'm primarily an outdoor sport climber who's been climbing for 2.5y and more seriously for 1.5y. Body stats: 170cm and 65kg (5'7" and 140#)

I mostly climb slabs and vertical routes on gneiss outdoor, between french 6a and 7a. Recently I've been on-sighting the majority of 6b's and some 6b+'s, and second-going 6c's.

My long term goals are to become a better climber and continue to enjoy the sport in all its forms, including more athletic routes and bouldering outdoors. For these reasons I've been training strength and power with some focus in the last few months.

I have access to a 2016 Moonboard, which unfortunately is set at 45 degrees, making it insanely difficult for me.
After some long term projecting, I was only able to send a handful of the non-benchmark V3s and the easiest benchmark V4 (An easy problem - not for me! It took probably close to 20 sessions). As another reference, I can hold the bottom edges of the Beastmaker 2000 (14mm I think) for 5sec with about 10kg added weight.

Up to a couple of months ago, my weekly schedule was:
Mon: Moonboard limit bouldering
Tue: climb outdoors (mix of on-sights and projects depending on what's available)
Thu: lead climbing in the gym
Sat: climb outdoors

At the end of September I decided to drop the Moonboard workout due to plateauing and frustration. After projecting some of the most repeated V4s for months, I wasn't seeing any progress: no new single moves or links in most of the sessions. I decided to do a max hangs/pull ups/core workout instead, and I progressed nicely on it since then. 

The plan was to go back to the Moonboard at the beginning of 2023, hopefully with some added strength.
Yesterday I did an impromptu session on the MB, as I wasn't able to do any other climbing because of the weather. I was surprised to discover that I regressed significantly in these two months! I'm now unable to do most of my warm-up climbs on the board (i.e. the stands of some of the easiest V3s, which I was easily doing in full summer conditions). I'm sure the added strength just takes a few sessions to transfer and I'll get back the power and contact strength in the same time frame, but just hang boarding with the expectation to improve doesn't look a feasible strategy anymore...

Where do I go from here?
I'm pretty sure I'm not overtraining. Quite the opposite, in fact: given the styles and grades I climb outdoors, often I'm not that physically tired at the end of the sessions. Also the volume of routes I'm able to climb in a session is limited outdoors, as typical I guess.
Climbing plateau - advice on improving and improving I’ve hit a plateau and cannot seem to make much improvement and would like some feedback on my training plan.

Background:

I climb 2-3x a week for about 2-4 hours per session.  My max grade is 5.10a/b on sport and v1 while bouldering.  

I’ve been climbing for about 1.5 years.

I am 5’8 and weigh 182 lbs.  I certainly need to lose weight as I am probably 20 lbs overweight.

I think I lack strength and endurance.  My technique is decent, and I climb fairly smoothly.  However, I suck at overhangs and making “powerful” strong moves.  I can do about 1 pull-up on a bar. 

My training is all over the place and I’m not sure it’s helpful.  Here’s a general routine:

Hangboard 3-4x a week (4 sets of 10 second hangs on the largest crimps).

Climb 2-3x a week at the gym or outside when the weather is nice.  While at the gym I train technique and climbing “quietly.”  I’ll warm up by climbing easy climbs and doing them efficiently.  Then I will climb harder routes until I’m pumped out.  

On non climbing days I’ll work on antagonistic muscles: push-ups, dips, pull-ups, resistance band workouts.

I’m kind of stuck at this 5.10a/b range.  I’ll project and work some 11’s in the gym but I feel i aimlessly climb and train.

I’m looking for some training feedback - what’s holding me back from progressing?  Is it as simple as weight loss?
some things I've noticed breaking through a plateau Hey gang,

I've been climbing for a few years now and wanted to share 2 things that I thought were really helpful to me when breaking ground in my higher grades or just some general quality of life things for my climbing. Hope this can help out some people in one way or another. 

TL;DR at the bottom

First thing has been structuring training sessions/ gym sessions. I think it's far too often I fall into the pit of some structured training plan to address one weakness and then another weakness comes up or there's another part of the workout I really want to do and end up spending hours at the gym doing some form of training after another and another and am exhausted by the end. Once I really structured my sessions in the gym, I wouldn't feel as tired by the time I left and could focus more on putting more effort in the things I have delegated for that day which resulted in some great improvements. 

Second has been just climbing with people who are stoked to climb. It sounds really simple but mental is a huge part of the sport and being around people who want to see you succeed and are moreso excited to see you succeed is really awesome and has encouraged me to try stuff far beyond my perceived ranges. Prior to this year I've been in a bit of a lull and revamping the crew has been critical towards success this season and anecdotally has made a huge impact for me. 

Let me know what other sage wisdom you've accrued over your climbing career.

TL;DR
Your training sessions don't have to be as long as they may be. Finding stoke can really reignite some crushing.
Cutting muscle while still training Hi all! I'm a new climber, started just under a year ago and love it! I come from a background of 5+ years of powerlifting, which has conferred some notable advantages and disadvantages onto my climbing style.

Firstly, I'm quite heavy for a climber of my size. I'm 5'11, +4 ape index, and generally land between 180-185 lbs/ 81-84 kg bodyweight. When I started, I expected this would limit me primarily on overhanging terrain, but it seems to me that it becomes a problem more when I'm forced to exert high force on crimps, and on slabs where I have to put a lot of force through my toes on very small holds. I have a ton of upper body power though, and I'm dispropotionately strong on slopers and pinches. For instance; my gym recently put up a V9 climb consisting almost entirely of large holds and slopers, with lots of foot cutting and campusing. I was capable of linking every move on the route except one; a piano match on an overhang using a ~15mm crimp, with only one foothold. For context, the hardest grade I've climbed to date is V6. 

EDIT: I also possess a lot of natural flexibility, I'm capable of doing a split down to 2-3 inches from the ground with no real training. This is true of every part of my body including hips and shoulders.

My issue is that I've struggled greatly to reduce my weight. The 5 years of powerlifting have resulted in my body being very quick to build muscle, and very resistant to losing it. My body composition is already low fat%, and so I would love some advice on how to train in a way that will be conducive to losing unnecessary muscle mass that's preventing me from having an optimal strength/weight ratio.

Currently, I climb 3x a week (right now I'm solely bouldering, but my plan is to cycle between bouldering and route climbing in 3-4 month long blocks). Before each session, I do a short, low volume/high intensity workout consisting of a weighted pulling exercise (usually pullups, 1-3 sets of 1-3 reps at 85-95% of 1 rep max, with weekly progressive overload. Periodization and loading is based on the book Triphasic Training by Cal Dietz, if anyone knows of it.). I do deadlift once a week with the same parameters as well. My philosophy is that in my current state, I do not need to do extraneous training for any attribute that I can't improve by just climbing, and thus I have decided against hangboard training for the time being.

A climbing session generally consists of a 15-20 minute warmup where I focus on one particular skill or technique, usually footwork fundamentals. 

This is followed by an hour of working on whatever my current project is, focusing on resting adequately between attempts and climbing with commitment and energy during attempts.

I take a 15 minute break where I rest, eat a small snack, and hydrate. Then I do another hour of climbing where I reduce structure and focus on whatever gets me excited that day. Sometimes I work more on my project, sometimes I work on spray wall problems, and sometimes I just goof around and have fun with my buddies.

Currently I climb v6 indoors, and 5.12b/7a indoors on toprope. I haven't yet learned how to lead climb, and unfortunately have no access whatsoever to outdoor climbing/bouldering.

This post feels rambly as I look back over it, so I apologize for anything that's unclear. I would love feedback on how to make my posts more informative.
Sent my first V15 this past season - AMA I don't frequent this subreddit too much, but when I do, I notice a lot of (often) negative discussion regarding weight. As a heavier climber (170-185 range, 5'9.75") who has climbed "harder" I thought it my perspective may be of value. I've also been nerding on training and improving my performance for over a decade, so I'm happy to share tips, tricks, advice, etc and hope it can be of help to someone. Cheers!
Request for critiques of my training plan : Balancing between training to climb hard outside and being a balanced athlete. Hi everyone, 

I'm jumping on the training critique train to kindly ask for feedbacks for my training routine.


**Presentation**

I'm a 23 years old male, 1m65 (around 5'4?), 60kg +/- 2kg.

*Goal* : Send my V11 crimpy project in Font and being comfortable in the V8/V9 boulders. 

*Training history* 

2002 - 2016 : Lead climbing two months a year in the Alps with my family, never trained hard nor focused on hard routes. Climbing was just an activity I did with my family in summer. 

2016 - 2017 : Falling in love with bouldering, sent my first V6 in Font. Only climbing. 

2017 - 2021 : On and off climbing periods because of studies, discovered calisthenics and climbed just a few times a month. 

2021 - 2022 : Started seriously climbing in September 2021. First V8 in Font, that's my current harder grade I've climbed outside.


With my on and off periods of climbing, I kind of lost my motivation and love for climbing. But when I discovered my V11 project, I fell in love with it. It really suits my style and I'm able to do all the moves and split the boulder in 2 parts. I need now to link the 2 parts. 
Hence why I decided to work on a much harder project than what I sent before, needed to find motivation again. 


*Strengths* : Crimping, static moves, shouldery moves, feet placements (see "Le mur des lamentations, Isatis, Font) totally my style.

*Weaknesses* : Dynamic moves, boulder reading, pinch, sloppers, compression (see Lady Big Claques, Font) 

**Training plan**

Unfortunately I left Font because of my work. I'm now quite far and can come back just a few times a year. But I'm really motivated to train hard to become stronger. 
However being stronger is not my only goal, I also want to look better and become more complete (with hypertrophy training and some cardio). 

Here's how I trained for the last 2 months : 

*Monday* : Leg training with weights (back squats, bulgarian split squats, hip thrust, nordic curl)

*Tuesday* : Moonboard 

*Wednesday* : Calisthenics, Upper body (Advanced tuck front lever pull ups / RTO dips, weighted arched pull ups / weighted ring dips (or Bulgarian dips), ring curls / ring triceps extension and handstand) 

*Thursday* : Rest day / Run with my colleagues

*Friday* : moonboard

*Saturday* : Calisthenics (same session than Wednesday)

*Sunday* : Moonboard (or rest day depending on how I feel and what chores I have to do in my flat).

I bike to work and to the climbing gym as well, which amount to 100km a week approximately. 


I fell in love with the moonboard and I plan to complete all the benchmarks. I'm still in the 6B+ (BM2016), and send between 2 to 3 BM each session. I'm not very interested in climbing the boulders in the gym because I don't like the comp style, I'm here to get stronger at outdoor climbing. 

I'm very careful of injuries and take a lot of time to warm up and listen to my body a lot. Hence, I didn't injure myself for now, but I'm conscious that this much training is very tiring. Hence why I do a deload week every 4 weeks. 


I do a bit of sport climbing once every month for the whole weekend. After this weekend, I rest a lot before resuming my climbing training. 


**Questions**

- What do you think of my training routine ? How can I improve it ? 

- I want to improve my pinch strength, hence I bought the quad block from lattice training. Can I work max pinch strength at the beginning of my moonboard sessions ? Won't it worsen my session? 

Thank you for your feedbacks,
Some takeaways from 7 years of bouldering Was inspired by u/treentp 's '5-year retrospective' and decided I also had some takeaways to share. The original post was extremely in-depth so I will do my best to avoid redundant information.

For a brief history, I started climbing in 2014/2015. I began competing in 2017 while climbing about v6ish. Was at a pretty aggressive disadvantage as most of the kids in my category had been climbing for nearly a decade already. Stopped competing after my Junior season and moved to Colorado for school. I immediately fell in love with outdoor bouldering and have put the majority of my energy into that, and have managed to climb a number of v12/8a+ boulders and will hopefully take down my first v13 this spring (hopefully). I have unfortunately never been able to dedicate myself 100% to training due to being busy with school, a job, and a relationship, but I think being able to balance effective training with all the other shit that life brings is really important, so hopefully my perspective will be of some importance to some of you all. Also, I have started coaching a youth team this year which has really helped me put my thoughts about all of this into words, so I am now able to articulate what I have learned.

First I have a list of some important things I wish I knew when I started climbing.

1. **Watch people that are better than you**

I wouldn't consider myself to be a strong climber aside from my fingers, but strength is only half the story. I think that technique and mindset are equally, if not more, important than strength. I have been lucky enough to be surrounded by people much stronger than me for nearly the whole time I've been climbing, and one of my main climbing partners climbs v16 pretty regularly. I attribute nearly all of my technique, mindset, and process to watching him climb. You can climb as much as you possibly can, you can get coached by a professional, you can listen to podcasts, but I think that none of those are as beneficial as just watching someone climb that is better than you. Pay attention to all the little things that they do, and you will learn more than you thought you could. Also, ASK QUESTIONS. I know it's intimidating, but nearly all of the strong climbers that I know are some of the sweetest people on the face of the planet. They climb because they truly love the sport, and I guarantee that 99% of them would be more than happy to share some insights with someone new to the sport. 

2.  **Don't climb for the ego**

This was a trap that I fell into pretty aggressively at the start of my climbing. What I mean by don't climb for the ego, is don't only climb at your max grade. I climbed my first v6! yay! now time to only ever try v6's, if it's below my max grade and I don't flash, then I won't try it again. This is unfortunately something I see really often when coaching children. Because you have broken that mental barrier of the new grade, all you want to focus on is that new grade. Either that or your ego is telling you that you suck if you fall off a v5 because you did that pink v6 in the corner. STYLE MATTERS. I get it, falling off of something below your max grade can be depressing, but it's also a learning moment. Why did you fall? Is it not your style? Then you should climb it to get better at that style. Is it too tall? Then you should climb it to learn how to climb taller. Are you too tired? Then you should climb it to get better at trying hard when you're tired. Because climbing is a purely success-based sport, it's easy to just move on and try something harder because you want the success of a harder grade, but there is a reason why you failed. Identify it, internalize it, and work on it. And a side note: no one cares that you're working a v7 when people saw you climb that v8 the other day. I promise you, no one cares.

3. **Be nice to yourself**

This one is crucial and is something that I try to stress often to the kids. Be nice to yourself. It is ok to have a bad day, it is ok to feel weak some days, it is ok to get frustrated and lose motivation. Bad days are natural, if you don't have bad days then there is probably something wrong with you. Whenever something like this happens, find a reason. A reason is not an excuse, but a genuine possible explanation. Recognizing these reasons will help you find patterns that will help later on down the line. I personally record all of these reasons in my training journal. I feel tired today, maybe because I only slept for 4 hours last night. I feel weak today, maybe it's the beer I drank last night. Internalize these and apply them to your future decision making. As a continuation of this, celebrate the small victories. Sure you didn't send your project today, but you got one move closer, that counts as success. Even if you didn't get one move closer, maybe you found a different position that makes the next move feel a little bit more doable,

4. **FOR THE LOVE OF GOD EAT FOOD**

I am a relatively skinny person and always have been. I was around 130 two years ago at my same height. I feared putting on weight as I thought it would make it harder to climb. As I have put on a bit of weight I have learned that all eating more does is give me more energy and strength. I also fell into the trap of punishing myself for not sending. Oh I'm not gonna eat ice cream because I didn't send. I get ice cream when I send. Sure rewarding yourself is good, but punishing yourself is bad. Just because you didn't send doesn't mean you didn't expend the same if not more energy. You need to refuel your body even if you didn't send.

5. **Training is unnecessary (for some people)**

This might be a hot take, and I apologize if it is, but it's something I truly believe in. Until you're climbing AT LEAST v7, training is completely unnecessary. There is no exercise or training routine that is going to help you improve faster than just climbing, Time on the wall is the absolute most important thing in the beginning of your climbing.

6. **Have fun**

We've all been there, day 15 of the project and you fall off the last move for the 7th time that day, you sit there and realize "damn, I'm just not even having fun anymore". It's time to walk away. Take a break, climb something else. I see this a lot with some of my extremely strong partners and with kids in the competition scene. Your whole life is dedicated to succeeding. If you're not succeeding, you're not having fun. Remind yourself why you even do this. At the end of the day, we all climb because it's fun, and sometimes you need to remind yourself of that. Climbing should be a stress relief, it shouldn't add stress.

7. **Get stoked**

This seems like a simple thing, but it can be hard to remember. The more stoked you are, the stronger you will feel, simple as that. I have had days where even though I have been feeling really strong recently, I'm a little not stoked about the weather, or I'm thinking about other things, or I'm just not super motivated, and all the strength goes out the window. The more you want it, the more pumped you are to just get out and touch rock, the stronger you will feel.

8. **Enjoy the process**

This is a lesson that I learned very recently while working on one of my summer projects. It wasn't an especially long process, only a 7-day project, but it was an hour-long drive and an hour-long hike both ways. Starting on day 2 I was falling off the last move from the ground 5-7 times per session. I got into a hole of just not enjoying it. I'm not sure what happened, but I woke up one day and a switch clicked, I began to truly enjoy the drive, enjoy the hike, enjoy dragging the stashed pads out of the hole, enjoy ticking the feet, enjoy every aspect of it. This turned it from something that felt like a chore into something that I truly wanted to be doing. I think that this change of mindset was one of the main things that got me up that boulder.

Hopefully some of this proves to be useful. More than happy to answer any questions anyone has. And if I missed anything that seems important feel free to add it below.

Also apologies for any typos or grammatical errors, I have just finished finals and have no desire to proofread this.
My home wall. Took a lot to get here and it’s going to take a lot more to fully make it filled in as a spray wall. Does anyone have any suggestions as to hold layouts or different holds I should get?

Goal to go from V8 to V11 in one year. End of the year update Hello Climbharder! It's now been a year and the time has come for me to make an update.

I'm gonna start this post with quoting Wolfgang Gullich: "Getting strong is easy, Getting strong without getting injured is hard." The quote will be highly relevant to this post.

The goal I made for myself at the start of the year was this: Send an 8A boulder indoors, outdoors or on kilterboard before the year ends.

So did I make my goal? No, not really. But I did make loads of progress and I wasn't that far off. My highest outdoor grade at the start of the year was 7A and my highest indoor was 7B+. I have now sent 2 7B+ and 7C outdoors, aswell as 2 7Cs and one 7C+ Indoors. So I went from 7B+ to 7C+ in a year.

I spent a good part of the year recovering from injuries and my finger strength improved a lot at the start of the year, then dropped off drastically as I developed Synovitis in several fingers. I did 2 blocks of Max Hangs, 2 blocks of weighted pull-ups, 2 blocks of 4×4s, 1 long block of flexibility with Lattice and a large part of the year only climbing. I have logged what type of session I had every time I trained for the past year, so for the nerds I have some deeper details. But here are some benchmarks from this year.

Weighted Pull-Ups 1 RM:
- 1 Feb, +40kg. (BW 72kg)
- 26 April, +44kg. (BW 72kg)
- 19 Sep, +47.5 (BW 74kg)

Weighted Max Hang 7 sec, 20mm:
- 1 Feb, +36kg. (BW 72kg)
- 26 April, +50.5kg. (BW 72kg)

Climbro One Arm Max Force Test 23mm:
- 9 Sep, 70kg right arm, 64kg left arm (BW 74kg)
- 17 Oct, 75kg right arm, 70kg left arm (BW 73kg)

I can also do front levers now. My max pull on the Campus board is 1-4-6 and has been the same all year. Perhaps my power is a weak point compared to the rest of my benchmarks, but I seem to get tweaky shoulders anytime I try to start Campus Boarding.

But number wise, obviously I'm stronger and if I found the right 8A I might have a chance, but I chose an outdoor project that was hard as nails. My project was a very powerful 7C+ consisting of 2 wickedly hard moves with an 8A sit start of 7 moves. I almost did the stand start, spent 7 sessions on it, several of them alone in the cold. I travelled hours to get there, carrying crashpads and walking a lot. Needless to say, it was hard to project that thing without a car and at session 6, progress was so incredibly small and I started getting mentally burned out. I admitted defeat for the moment and retreated to the gym to get back into hard training.

This is the biggest lesson I have learned in climbing this year:
- If I let a grade get stuck in my head, I start to base my self worth on the grade. If I send a specific grade and get cocky, my ego will take some damage when I can't send problems below that grade later. My cousin works as a routesetter. Seeing him make some random guess as to what the grade is of a problem, then seeing how much that impacts everyone's perception of the problem is quite eye opening. People really let the grade get to them, including me. Now I don't trust the person who says "I don't care about grades", because of course you do, you're only human. But being aware of our human tendency to compare ourselves and base self worth off a plastic tag goes a long way. I care about grades and I want to send higher grades, but I also make fun of myself for caring which helps me not take it seriously while still striving for improvements in the grades.

In conclusion; I don't know if it was a smart idea to put up this goal to finish within a relatively short timeline. It pushed me to really try hard, but it made failure unbearable at times and all the gains I made still made me feel like it wasn't good enough compared to where I wanted to be.

The reason for this goal was:
My ultimate goal is to pursue climbing full time and climb at a really high level in bouldering and maybe lead aswell. I work 50% at a climbing gym as a trainer/coach to spend the rest of my time climbing and training as much as I can. But I started climbing at age 20 (now 23) and I constantly feel the pressure that I won't be able to live out that dream if I don't maximize my genetic potential as soon as I can before I get too old to have a chance at competing at a high level and climb hard grades. So I set really high goals for myself, because to me, my future depends on it. This might be a unhealthy way to view climbing, but I've based my life around it for better or worse. I'd be open to alternative ways of viewing climbing to enjoy it more or feel the pressure of time less, but I'm dead set on trying to live off of climbing full-time.

Now on to continue my goal and try to reach it the coming year! I'll be training for nationals in Mars and then a trip to Rocklands in July. Psych is high!

If you have any inputs, thoughts or questions, lemme know! Thanks people, this subreddit has helped me many times on many levels! ✌️
2022 Retrospective: Hitting a lifetime goal (8a/8A) # 2022 Retrospective: Hitting a lifetime goal (8a/8A)

Climbing an 8a (5.13b) route and an 8A (V11) boulder has always been a long term goal of mine. At the beginning of 2022 it finally seemed like something I could realistically target. 8A/V11 was ambitious: I had one V10 under my belt, but an extremely underdeveloped pyramid (no V9s and just a few V8s). 8a/5.13b was more realistic: I had been climbing 7c/12d relatively consistently and had redpointed two 7c+/13a routes.

I knew I needed to spend the bulk of my time on bouldering, and set a subgoal of filling out my pyramid by doing at least 8 V8s, 4 V9s, and 2 V10s in addition to / prior to trying to do V11.

I finished out the year climbing way better than I expected, having sent 12 V8s, 10 V9s, 2 V10s, sending my first V11 in December, and redpointing 8a in March and flashing (!) another 8a in September. 

Quick stats: 28M, 5’10”, 150lbs, 20mm 10s max hang 150% bw (+75lbs)

## What I did

During the spring and fall I climbed outside basically every week, almost always bouldering. I dedicated one week in March to the first 5.13b route, and one weekend in September to the other. Over the summer I went on a full time climbing trip but spent most of it doing easier trad climbing and only in August trying hard again. 

My gym sessions (1-2x a week) were fairly unstructured, usually climbing around Vflash level in the gym and occasionally having fun with the Kilter or Moonboard.

A typical outdoor session usually consisted of a 15-30 minute off the wall warmup targeting major muscle groups and fingers, and then immediately sessioning the 1 or 2 problems selected for that day until I was tired (about 4-6 total hours out). Most of the V8s took 1 session to complete, with a couple flashes, the V9s took 1-2 sessions, the V10s took 3 sessions, and it took 8 sessions to do the V11. I also put a fair number of sessions into V10/11 boulders that I never ended up sending.

A lot of people I talk to are astonished that I do no structured training at all. I like to think of my experience as emblematic of what “just climb” can potentially do for you. My hangboard numbers are low for my grade but not absurdly low, so I think of a lot of my progress this year as fully realizing my strength potential. 

## What I think I learned

Hands down it feels like the “secret” was just going outside more. This was the first year that I climbed consistently almost every week outside. I live in the northeast USA, so it wasn’t always easy, but I was stoked - more than a few sessions I was topping out through snow, holding on to wet holds (not sandstone), and seeing decent progress despite subprime conditions. Specificity is king: if your goal is to climb hard boulders outside you have to climb hard boulders outside. This idea is thrown around a lot already, but I found there’s a big difference between knowing it and living it, if that makes sense. 

I also think that focusing on the pyramid at slightly sub-max grades (V8/9, for me) had really good synergy with increased sessions outside - even in poor conditions I could work V8/9. Climbing a ton of V8/9s in a variety of styles and lengths built a fantastic base - the three harder boulders I did this year break down into V9 + V7, V7 + V9, and V9 + V9 more or less. I didn’t have to do harder moves to climb V11 - I just had to learn how to climb V9 really, really well. 

I also learned a lot about session tactics throughout the year. As a mostly-weekend warrior, I think that efficient energy usage during a session makes a huge difference in how quickly I can do a boulder. Some of the “tricks” I picked up:

- Feel all the holds from the ground / pad stack so you know the best way to grab everything before you even pull on, and know exactly how your fingers relate to your chalk ticks (eg, index vs. middle finger goes onto the tick)
- Practice hand movements for precision moves while sitting/standing on the ground (literally, move your hand from one hold to the other over and over again - this costs no energy and helps train your body/hand-eye coordination for the movement)
- Avoid flash pump as much as possible. Part of this means a good warmup. Another part of this is to drop off the boulder earlier than you think you need to when you’re still in the learning stages of a hard project. I often hang all the positions I can access, then try to do each single move, before even starting to make links. Sloppy links when you're not close to sending == wasted energy.
- Check your ego at the door, and practice the important links. If you keep falling on the 4th move, stack pads and start at move 3. If there’s a high redpoint crux, low-point the boulder. Too many times I see people wasting entire sessions trying from the ground and falling at the same place over and over again. 

Finally, this year I successfully managed to avoid injury (big change from previous years). I attribute this to reducing gym volume overall, introducing deload weeks (standard timing, 3+1), and starting a more systematic off-wall warmup. 

## On sport climbing

I only have a couple short comments to make on sport climbing. The first 8a I did was basically a V7/8 boulder into a decent shake into a V4 outro and took 2 sessions. The second 8a (flash) I did was essentially a 40 ft. PE V8 boulder problem (or 3 V5s back to back). 8a is definitely easier than V11 for me - I think if I were to really focus on sport climbing at my max (eg, more around 14a/b) I would need to invest many more outdoor and indoor days working endurance, but it seems like if I’m willing to underperform by a couple letter grades that bouldering passively improves my sport climbing without much sport-specific investment. 
 
## What’s next

I’m starting to notice that it feels like finger strength, especially high angle crimps, are starting to become a limiting factor on some of the more powerful V10/11 boulders I haven’t been able to do yet. Another major weakness I have that I have yet to address is compression and chest strength (bench max around 120lb, and literally cannot do V7 gym sloper problems lol). So despite having had such a good year with no real training, I’m thinking that I might need to hit the gym a bit more seriously next year if I really want to take my bouldering to the next level. 

At the same time, I don’t really feel the stoke for V12 in the same way I felt it for V11. I’m most looking forward to just doing more V10 and V11 boulders, hoping that what I did for V9 in 2022 I can do for V10 in 2023.

TLDR (1) follow the psych, if you have enough psych you can do anything, and (2) if you really want your climbing to change, you have to do something different than what you were doing before.
Pro Rock Climber Drew Ruana AMA Hey Everyone,

I was contacted by u/eshlow to do an Ask Me Anything on today at noon. A little bit about myself- I've been climbing for 20 years, I grew up competing for Vertical World Climbing Team from ages 8-18 and later for the USA in the IFSC world cup circuit years 2017-2019. Since the end of 2019 I quit comp climbing to pursue outdoor goals. I'm currently a full time junior at Colorado School of Mines studying Chemical Engineering. Ask me anything about climbing, training, projecting, recovery, etc!
Developing "climbing intuition" I've been climbing consistently for around a year now - I climb 3 times a week inside (around 2 hours per session) and once a week outside. I try to structure my sessions to make the most out of them (see my routine at the bottom of the post)

However despite all this work, I'm climbing at \~V3/5.10, which is disappointing. I've been trying to narrow down what's holding me back, and I think what it comes down to is a very poor sense of "how" to climb. I'll often be trying a problem over and over again (typically stuck on one move for weeks), not really getting any closer to sending it. Finally, I'll have someone show me how to send it, and I'll be able to send it myself shortly after. The vast majority of my projects I'm never able to send no matter how many weeks I spend working away at them unless I have someone show me the beta (despite my projects usually only being V4...). I've always been very unathletic growing up, so I think this comes down to just having very poor physical/body intuition.

Unfortunately my schedule tends to be pretty chaotic so it's difficult for me to go climbing with friends - I often have to go alone so don't really have people to discuss problems with. **I'm looking for suggestions on how I can better develop my sense of climbing intuition** (apart from the obvious - climb more - which I've already been doing to no avail).

# Current Routine

1. 15 minutes of warm up, where I focus heavily on fundamentals (i.e. good footwork, hips in, etc.)
2. 30 minutes of projecting (working at a problem just out of my climbing ability over the span of several sessions)
3. 45 minutes of hard climbing (working at difficult problems within my climbing ability, that I can typically send in one session)
4. 15 minutes of perfect climbing, where I take a problem I've sent before and keep reclimbing it in different ways to better understand it/improve my technique
How do you keep your hips loose? I'm a 6ft 30y man, my hips get TIGHT sometimes. All the muscles around the ball joint in there become very tight and it takes a lot of stretching to fix it.


I do butterfly, pigeon, lunges etc, but not diligently.


What do you do before, during, and after climbing to keep hips loose? Ideally I'd just like to hear about any similar experiences and specific stretch routines I can apply daily.


*Context*:


I sit at a desk all day for a job.


When I really fuck up it feels like the rotating joint in there is inflamed and I get nerve pain all the way down to my feet.


It seems to happen mostly on one side, so I'm doing 
something asymmetrical? My shoe has even gotten ripped on that side, which I suspect may be making things worse.


I've had both sides become very bad though in the past when I am not mindful of stretching bad warm-ups.


*Note* I am not requesting advice about the injuries I get, but instead asking how you prevent them by stretching routines, ibuprofen, ice or heat etc, if you experience anything similar.
Bouldering Training Schedule Hey guys,

I'm around 1,5 years into bouldering and recently wrote a training plan. I'd love to have some feedback about the volume and intensity since it's my first real cycle.

I did some strength stuff before, but never planned out a cycle like this. It shall last 5 weeks with progressive overload followed by a deload week.

&amp;#x200B;

About me:

I'm 1,78 m and around 72-75 kg with a +3 ape index.

I can't really say what grade I climb since our gym doesn't grade anything, but I can flash some stuff of the second hardest grade in our gym and did one climb of the hardest grade. 

I've never been to a real bouldering location before. I am planning to go on a lot of climbing trips this year, which was my intention for the training plan.

&amp;#x200B;

My week looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

**Monday:**

\-rest

**Tuesday:**

\-climb some easy stuff with good technique

\-board climbing

\-core-workout

**Wednesday:**

\-"perfect boulder"-drill

\-strength and conditioning

**Thursday:**

\-rest

**Friday:**

\-hangboarding

\-free climbing

\-core-workout

**Saturday:**

\-rest

**Sunday:**

\-limit bouldering

\-strength and conditioning

&amp;#x200B;

My core-workouts are pretty similar to the Lattice "Front-Lever-Progression". I'm in between stage 2 and 3 but will do the stuff of stage 2 for my first cycle. I also added some planks and side planks.

My strength and conditioning sessions look like this:

\-weighted pull-ups

\-shoulder-press

\-dips

\-rowing on rings

\-squats

\-facepulls

&amp;#x200B;

I do a proper warm-up before every session and stretch after every session.

I'd also love to know if you would recommend doing mobility sessions on rest days or if this would be too much.

Should I change the stimuli after the deload week or should I just restart the cycle afterwards?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for every reply and happy climbing everyone!
Very weak fingers Hi all,
A bit of background. So i’ve been climbing in the uk for roughly 7years.
My max outdoor grade is font 6C with a wide base at 6B/+. Mostly technical gritstone but many summers spent suffering on local limestone too.
I recently did a lattice finger test as I have long suspected my fingers are v weak for my grade &amp; barrier to improvement.
Turns out mine are ‘weak for V1’. Now what follows is probably the kind of question that gets asked by newbies after a year indoors but how might i get stronger? It seems hard to believe i can get up anything but clearly technique counts for something. The upside, i have a potential easy win here.. get strong fingers. But how? 

Fingerboard: I have a bit of history with it, through lockdown i got to the point i could hang bodyweight on 20mm (i know!) but given the option i’ll always tend to climb instead of a full hanging session as i find it quite boring. That said..I’ve started adding in a few good max hangs at the start of any indoor sessions.
Board: I recently had a few sessions on a beastmaker board with small feet..also moonboard and kilter. I did manage one 6A on the moonboard but generally since these are very fingery my board grade is around font 5. Slightly worried I could get injured using the board with my weak digits but it is a lot of fun and fingers feel nicely worked.

Or..focus on climbing almost exclusively on crimps for a stretch of time or some combo of the above?!

I’d be very interested to hear from anyone who managed to get this far without the basic strength others may take for granted. And generally any advice I may be able to use to bring myself up to a basic level of finger strength.
Many thanks all :)
Tips for flexibility in the hips? I've been struggling with flexibility for a long time. I have a lot of natural power and strength but I have an unnaturally limited range of motion laterally in my hips. This means that I've watched many people make things that I struggle with seem very easy by using their hips in ways that are incomprehensible to me. I've tried to imitate this and it's gotten a lot better in some positions but there are so many situations where I feel literally blocked from doing the move because of tight hips. I've been stretching somewhat frequently and intensely for a few months now, focusing on middle splits (I can touch my toes fine) and seen all of two inches increase. Clearly I'm focusing on the wrong things. 

I'm trying to do a combination of active passive and passive stretching. I focus mainly on limbering up the hips and then doing weighted Tailor pose, frog stretch, and middle splits holds for both time passively and time trying to pull the floor together. It feels intense, and I'm often a little sore the next day. I'm not going that intensely every session and I rest a lot.  The thing is, I'm convinced that I'm limited in some either anatomical way or in a way I am not addressing with these stretches. I have some theories. 

One thing I've noticed is that my lower back is extremely tight. Case and point is that I can barely sit up in a pancake stretch on the floor. The second thing I've noticed is that in a horse stance, I cannot sink deeply into it at all. This would suggest that my hip flexors and my lower back are both working against me. I'm thinking about spending some time focusing on seated good mornings, weighted hip flexor raises (lifting a kettlebell off the floor with foot), horse stance, and perhaps some lacrosse ball rolling in the glutes and adductors. Other than that I'm at a loss for what to do. I'm getting concerned that there's an anatomical limitation as no one I'm climbing with seems to struggle with their hips at all, and in some positions (e.g. standing straight up) I feel literally blocked by my hip structure in moving my legs into a straddle. 

Has anyone encountered similar problems and how did you address them?
Best approach for balancing Strength and Weight in a increasingly muscular climber Hey! Thanks in advance for reading - I wanted to keep this succinct and I’ve written my life story.- I’m a passionate climber - principally bouldering - with 2 1/2 years experience, 6’3” and around 85-90kg, pretty lean with a good understanding of nutrition, good eating habits etc. 

Outdoors I’ve bouldered a couple of (arguably soft) 7as outdoors, good baseline and volume in the 6s, and indoors generally have a good baseline across V5 (increasingly flash) V6 (style dependant) and occasionally, recently, a couple of V7s (could be soft but I’m not going to withhold myself the achievement). My successes tend to be in my wheelhouse and as the angle increases I see my capability drop. I’ve been specific in working these weaknesses and my most recent V7 was well off-vertical, but suited me for its reachy compression style and hold set.


I’m bouldering every other day, occasionally a lead session for fun and do flexibility work or core / cardio on my rest days depending on how I feel. I’ve started adding 5x sets of max hangs 2x a week before climbing, 20mm on the beastmaker using a resistance band to reduce weight, which I hope to reduce to bodyweight by end of year.  (Technically I’m pretty good - but there’s always room to improve - often if I can’t do something it’s because I’m bad at executing what I understand to be the beta 🤦‍♂️ - nothing like seeing someone do what you were thinking!)

Over the past 6 months I’ve been adding some S &amp; C to the end of my bouldering sessions; ( some combination of pull ups, hammer curls, shoulder press, press ups and/or chest press, underarm curls, reverse curls, rows, depending on how I feel or what I want to target). 

Needless to say I’ve put on some muscle and feel a bit heavier than I have previously - particularly post-Christmas… ahem. I’m approx 10kg heavier than when I began climbing, but my body composition has visibly, at least, shifted to a lower proportion of fat and a greater proportion of muscle.  

What I want to do is ensure I’m balancing the books between this muscle development and relative weight gain. Steep stuff is feeing harder the heavier I get. I’ve agonised about the additional weight and from reading/ listening to Buster Martin, Steven Dimmitt and some other sources I’ve concluded I’m in good shape, getting stronger and the muscle will be beneficial. 

I listen to and absorb a lot of content - perhaps too much - and it’s often dizzying and stressful in ensuring I’m doing the right thing. I’m thinking a narrower view - 

1 -
Max hangs
Limit boulder
Pull ups and mixed S and C

2- rest
Flexibility/ mobility (Shoulder and Hip)
Optional cardio (short jog)

3 -
Max hangs
Volume climbing below limit
Pull ups (weighted?)and antagonist focused S and C

4 - rest
Floor and bar core 
Optional cardio

5 -
Free session (outdoors preferred)

6 - rest - 2 or 4

7 - session 1 or 3


My question to you, the experts, (especially the tall, heavy and climbing hard) what are my best go-tos? How can I refine my approach / how have you seen success in the past here?

(TL;DR - what advice for structuring or planning training protocols for increasing strength relative to weight in a healthy but larger built climber)

Any help appreciated!
I was never afraid of falling, until I was. I learned to lead outdoors, with guys and gals who climb hard. Consequently, I started out unafraid of falling. It didn’t even cross my mind when I was climbing and in the rare instances it did, I ignored it easily. It allowed me to push myself through insecure moves and hard climbing. I quickly went from leading 5.9 to 5.10b/c and I attribute a lot of that to a willingness to go for sketchy, insecure, or really hard climbing without the fear of falling preventing me. 

And, then, almost ironically, that changed IN THE GYM…of all places. I took a huge fall in the midst of pulling up slack for a clip, while coming over a roof. My belayer was probably 30-40 pounds lighter than me. I fell far and she flung upwards, and my arse hit her in the face. My adrenaline was soaring, my heart pounding, and frankly, it scared the shit out of me. I’d taken some big falls prior, outdoors and indoors, but nothing like this. And so, it’s safe to say, I have some PTSD from it and I believe it’s effecting my climbing.

I have been training more than ever before and I can see the benefits it’s having on my climbing, but, to my own frustration, I am struggling to take those big hard moves, or those insecure moves, and this is IN A GYM, which I find kind of embarrassing. 

I’ve done some practice falls since but it hasn’t seemed to help. Knowing I’m going to fall, usually from pretty high up, indoors, doesn’t really scare me and hasn’t seemed to help much with this PTSD.

It’s mental and I believe it’s preventing me from climbing my absolute hardest and climb higher grades.

I don’t really know why I’m posting this. Maybe there are resources someone has used to get beyond this that they can recommend? I just need to start admitting it because I was truthfully embarrassed to for the longest time, simply because I was praised for being so confident and unafraid of taking risks and falling from very early on in my climbing. 

Thanks for reading.
What is your style, and what do you want it to evolve into? What are your favorite crushers' styles? I think as you develop as a climber, you develop a certain style. If someone were watching you climb in your element, how would they describe you from a visual perspective? How do you *want* to look like when climbing?

Ok, what does style have to do with climbing harder? If you assess your favorite crushers, what are their styles like? What are some commonalities? What are they generally *not* doing?

For example, I think I can climb pretty slow if I'm not being mindful about it. It's when I'm moving fast and aggressively that I do stuff at my total limit. Those times where I try propel my center of gravity quickly, even when I don't feel secure in my position or I feel awkward, is when I break through limit problems.

I think Keenan Takahashi has a sick climbing style (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDm_9J8REfY)). His movements are not only fast and aggressive, but there's a strong sense of commitment behind each movement.  It's almost...  dramatic?  In the sense that each move seems 100% deliberate.  


Aidan Roberts has a really strong looking style as well.  He appears to climb a bit slower, with more security, but he gets so much tension going on in his upper back.  It's like a combination of really pulling out (vs down/sideways) of the handholds and a shit ton of body tension.    


Obviously this also comes down to the problems they climb on.  The style I described about Aidan won't show up on a slab problem, but I guess style also kind of dictates what problems climbers gravitate towards too.
Do people actually “climb everyday”? I have been climbing 2-3 times a week with deload weeks every so often consistently for about a year now. I climb around 2 hours every session (1-4 hours being the min and max).  
  
My max is V8. Most average days I’ll start out with warmups in the V0-V4 range, then I’ll just try anything that looks fun which usually ends up between V5-V8+ range. I’m horrible at projecting and sticking with any training so I pretty much just climb.  
  
I never did any specific training while climbing and I only gym climb, but even then I never really have been able to effectively climb multiple days in a row. I’ve heard some people climb 5 days in a row and then 2 days off and then another 5 days in a row and even fit in some training into that. It also seems common for outdoor boulderers to work on max grade projects for multiple days in a row which seems even more insane.
  
How does that work? Do I just need to start trying to climb more often and my body will get used to it? Or if I just don’t have the fitness, what are some good ways to build it? I’m terrified of getting injured and while I feel strong in my muscles climbing consecutive days, my fingers and tendons just feel considerably weaker which is scary to me.
Advice on engaging shoulders/scapula, back? After plateauing around mostly the same grade for over a year, I have become adamant that I will find things to help my climbing progress. After many drills and some strength training (the usual story) I haven't seen much progress. This was until I was projecting a limit boulder with a friend that is a much more skilled and experienced climber than me...

^((The story for anyone who cares and a bit of detail)) ^(It was a particular move that required a technical drop knee position from two not-so-good crimps into a catch on a not-so-good sloper. For weeks I could not get anywhere near this move. Whilst some others did it slowly and controlled, I felt I had to dynamically catch it. My friend, after attempting many different things with me, finally asked me to really engage my scapula to pull with my back and engage the rest of the posterior chain (but specifically pulling the shoulders 'into my pockets'. After understanding this I was able to do the move slowly and controlled. Anyway... this made me realise that I had not been engaging my shoulders/scapula and using my back muscles properly. Rather, I had become so used to "hanging from my skeleton" that pulling properly almost seemed wrong...))

Is there any advice on how I can improve my shoulder/scapula engagement when climbing and really using the muscles in my back to pull on bad holds?

Also, sorry if I am getting my use of terminology mixed up between engagement of shoulders, scapula, and back!
What separates Ondra from the rest? What makes Ondra so much better? He's weaker(can barely frontlever, no exceptional strength relative to other pro climbers), his fingers aren't that strong(again, relative to other pro climbers), etc. I know the answer is of course efficiency and technique, but I'm more looking for something specific that I can apply to my own climbing. Is it a certain way of positioning his body? Does he have some hidden strength that I've missed? What specific parts about his climbing separates him from other climbers?

I have tried "mimicking" his climbing, by working on my speed and trying to keep closer to the wall. I've worked a lot on hip flexibility, which he himself says is a big strength of his(but not unlike other pro climbers though). For context, I redpoint 7B routes, and flash about 6c-6c+. No idea of my boulder grade though. I'm not following any specific routine, with the exception of stretching after every training session.

TLDR: What specific things can I do to climb more like Adam Ondra?

Thanks in advance.
My Golfers Elbow Solution Hey all! Figured I'd make a quick post for anyone in the same situation I was a 4-6 months ago. Reddits always been great for injury rehab ideas and help so hopefully this post helps someone else! 

I have had golfers elbow from climbing for about 6-7 months. Bad enough to severely limit my climbing and cause pain on the wall and when letting go of holds getting off the wall! Pain localized in my inner elbow area. 

I tried a lot of different things to try to help it and here's what ended up working (for me!! - not a doctor, go to a doctor, rest, be careful, Yada Yada Yada) :

- Rest. I took about 2 weeks off and in that time did a significant amount of antagonist rehab. 

- Wrist extensors with weighted rubber bands. 15 reps - 3 sets, twice a day. I used powerfingers weighted extensor bands. Pick a weighted band so that you're not repping out 100's of these reps a day, but more like 30-60 a day. Should feel hard towards the end of each set. 

- weighted dumbell extensor curls thrice a week along with my other antagonist training. I started at 5 lbs for 6-8 reps and increased weight whenever I hit 6 reps easily. Currently at 25 lbs for 6 reps. Goal here is to stay in the strength rep range as much as possible. You should be failing these curls at around 3-5 reps ideally. If you can only get one rep, too heavy. 8+ reps = too light. All the way down, all the way up, hold at the top for 1-2 seconds. 

- seated dumbell shoulder press. I personally started at around 25lbs in the strength rep range and am now at around 50lbs for 6 reps. Again, stay in rep range I described above. Form is important, don't arch your back and use full range of motion. If you feel pain, stop!!

The exercises above are what I think really helped rehab my golfers elbow (both arms) over the course of 1-2 months. I decreased climbing frequency from 3-4 time a week to twice at most. 

This is solely what worked for me and what I gleaned from surfing thousands of golfers elbow rehab reddit posts and my own research. Again, I did not go to a PT, a doctor, etc, so do at your own risk. Purely anecdotal! 

Good luck to anyone and I hope this helps someone out there!! :))
How to close the gap between body strength and finger strength safely as a new climber? Hey everyone! I'm a fairly new to bouldering (started about 6 months ago), and I'm really loving it. I came in with a fairly athletic background (calisthenics, soccer, and track and field) and as such have a decent amount of body strength: I can front lever for 5 seconds, one arm pullup (right arm only), campus 1-4-7 on juggy campus rungs, etc. I've sent some v5/v6's recently at a couple of different gyms that are mainly about either dyno or coordination moves. I work on my technique using drills a lot, and I do feel like that has helped with my progression (started at around v1 level).

However, the one glaring weakness I have is crimp strength. As of now, I can't comfortably hang BW two handed from a 20 mm edge, and on most v4/v5 problems with small holds, I get absolutely shut down. There have been some harder/more powerful climbs where I can do the entire boulder except one hold that's a crimp, and I just get stuck. It's been frustrating as I know this is a weakness that is really holding me back from more interesting and challenging climbs, and I can't use the technique I've built up when I can't even stay on the wall.

I know an important part of improving at climbing is working on your weaknesses, and I really want to work on this. However, I'm also aware of the fact that I'm a newer climber, and that rushing my progression can lead to injury. What in your opinion is the best way to make up for a glaring weakness in finger strength as a new (but perhaps coming out of novice stage) climber? I've definitely seen a lot of "just climb what you're not good at" floating around, but is just throwing myself only at problems with small holds safe, and/or the best way to go about things? Should I climb at a lower level with larger crimps (will that translate to smaller holds at higher grades)? Should I start low intensity/low frequency hangboarding to expose my fingers to a more controlled load? I have completely avoided hangboarding as well as closed/full crimping so far. I think any nuanced advice on the matter would be really helpful for the many people who have a similar profile as me, who might think that they can climb a lot harder than their tendons can handle due to their base strength (or is that not even a concern at this level?). Thanks everyone!
How to Structure Winter Bouldering Gym Training TLDR; I like 4x4’s but I want to know how often or how else I can improve power endurance for 100’ 5.10 Gunks trad climbs using only a grade-less bouldering gym. 

Hey all, 27F trad climber here with a gradeless bouldering gym as my training facility. 

I normally take the winter to do 12 weeks of lifting and calisthenics to balance myself out, but I’m not feeling lifting this winter. 

I’ve been doing the calisthenics 1-2x a week which consists of typically a total of 40 push-ups, and 2 other ab exercises like hanging leg raises or flutter kicks. I’m not looking to change that but just for context, I’m doing some low intensity stuff off the wall. 

What I’d like to know is how I can create a weekly cycle including 2-3 productive gym sessions. I did one set of 4x4 yesterday on V4/5ish type of stuff where my max is V5/6 depending on style. Rest time was about 30-45 seconds to the best of my ability in a small busy gym. Every rep I did my best to clean up technique and efficiency. My gym has no grades so I chose problems around RPE 8 for this exercise. In the past I’ve been able to do 2 sets of 4x4 in a session but I wanted to hit my project because it was unexpectedly still up. [My New Gym Climbs Spreadsheet](https://imgur.com/a/c4D2EMN)

After that 4x4 set I did some projecting which I was happy with getting one move further on my project for a total of a 2 hour session. I take a timed 10 minute break after the 4x4 and again mid-projecting. 

Can I do 4x4’s twice a week? I know it takes our bodies 48-72 hours to recover, and a week to see the adaptations. I’m the past I’ve done 2 sets, once a week for 4-6 weeks before the season starts up again. 

I’m obviously looking to improve my power endurance, as I’m currently climbing 5.8 trad (typically 80-100 ft climbs) and aiming to hit 5.10 this spring season. Gunks NY if anyone is curious. 

I’m always working on my technique and often taking videos of my climbing, so that’s already a thing. I’m just trying to stave off the pump on these 100’ laybacks and big ass Gunks overhangs. 

I’m open to other drills like 3-second lockoff hold, I’m always working on rooting when it’s clear I need it for a project climb, or other suggestions. 

Thanks in advance and I’m sorry if I left out any info, I just don’t think y’all need my height, ape index and weight since it’s somewhat irrelevant to my inquiry. Happy to share if anyone asks.
New Year, New Finger Methods Hey nerds,

In the last couple months C4HP has been pushing the new idea that adding loads on max hangs (on already adapted athletes) fails to get the finger flexor recruitment we seek from max hangs. I won’t act like I can explain it more than that so I’ll link below to recent podcasts that go into the weeds on this. His Nugget Patreon follow up tipped me off to all this. 

https://www.trainingbeta.com/media/tyler-limits-fingerboard/ 

https://youtu.be/JtIyMWrHbwQ 

As someone who has plateaued on max hangs for the last couple years, it’s nice that there could be hope for a new stimulus. I’m of course biased to believe the benefits here but what am I missing? Max recruitment without the heavy hangs on the shoulders leaves me with more energy for on the wall training, something I had to compromise to see any max hang results. It also sort of explains last year's fads of switching to repeaters or “Emil’s” feet-on-hangs showing quick noob gains.

Just started this a week ago but I’ll be doing twice a week workouts that are 5 sets of 5 reps. A rep being a 1s finger curl at 80-85% of my tested one rep max. 3-4 weeks then a deload/reassessment week before I debrief on here and start up again. I’ve also been doing an abridged version as a super quick warm up on climbing days too, and it feels amazing honestly.

Edit: One month update in the comments below. TLDR: modest gains were had, no pulley's exploded, board climbs feeling better than ever.


I figured this can serve as a place to discuss this new theory science and validity, propose mass Tindeq sales conspiracies and share your long term anecdotal evidence and results. Personal opinions on what qualifies a certain someone to give free internet advice to a minimum, we're all just here to give and receive free advice from the internet (;

Cheers
Born without an A2 pulley -- anyone have experience? **Let me be clear before I start this post that I'm not asking for any medical advice, I trust my hand therapist and doctors. I'm just curious to hear other people's experiences!**

Hi everyone! Last summer I sustained an A3 pulley rupture (in the most anticlimactic way possible – it just snapped while holding a large crimp on a V2 in the gym…sad). I finally got pulley reconstruction surgery on Monday. This morning I had a follow up appointment to remove the dressing and set up a splint and I learned some interesting information. The surgeon told me that to his surprise, when they were operating they found that I had no A2 pulley to begin with – that's probably why the A3 rupture was such a problem, because I didn't have the A2 to compensate at all. I'll never know whether I'm missing an A2 pulley in any of my other fingers because it's not very visible on an MRI. (I mean they didn't even know that I didn't have an A2 from the MRI I got for this injury, they only knew when they physically cut me open). The surgeon and the hand therapist I was talking to have said that they've never seen this before, and googling around I can't seem to find any information. Have any of you heard of somebody genetically missing an A2 or have experience with it yourself? I don't really know how this will affect my climbing going forward, like if my other fingers are more vulnerable as well... 

Apologies for any typos here, I'm using speech to text because typing is rough!
My experience with golfers elbow/medial epicondylitis/tendinosis etc. [POSITIVE] I know there is a sizeable amount of climbers out there with varying degrees of medial elbow pain/injury, and since I have dealt with this injury on pretty much every spectrum, I thought I would share my own experience and hopefully it is useful for someone. As a preface, I am fully aware of all the current literature and general advice regarding tendonitis, so if any of what I am doing deviates from this, it's simply because I've found it to work better for me through trial and error. Happy to answer any questions if anyone reads this :)

Training background:

\- 186cm, weight fluctuates from 68-74kg (more on this later)

\- Started bouldering roughly 10 years ago with a pretty solid intermediate base of calisthenics (freestanding handstand pushups, one arm pullups for reps, full front lever for 5 seconds

\- Progressed fairly rapidly through strength alone, climbed about V5-V6 outdoors within my first year of climbing. 

\- Subsequently i've basically stagnated around this level of climbing due to medical school, studies, and subsequently residency. Basically didn't prioritize climbing. 

Throughout this time, i've dealt with multiple injuries, most of which i've rehabilitated tenaciously, and successfully. Very mild climbers elbow was a recurring injury for me although it never really became chronic. Fast forward to the past couple of years, i've probably had the worst time possible in my climbing career, and had the worst case of climber's elbow i've ever had. It essentially became chronic (12 months+). I chalk this down to several things:

\- Poor nutrition. As a hospitalist, doctors basically eat like trash 90% of the time. This is a generalization, of course, but with the burden of the pandemic, 36 hour shifts, sporadic night/day working hours, you can imagine my diet was pretty bad. Sometimes it's a simple matter of not having time to eat, sometimes it's not having time to prep, or go get a proper meal etc. My weight also plummeted to 68kg (150lbs) which is very light for my frame. 

\- Poor sleep. Same deal as above. I calculated my average sleep last year and it was somewhere in the realm of 3-4 hours a night. Some nights I don't get to sleep at all

\- Altered mindset. This was actually a really big contributing factor. Even though I was so tired, I always maintained a baseline level of psyche. This is because climbing is my primary outlet for stress. So when I did get time to climb, I had the mentality that I had to make the most of the session, every single time. This meant truncating warm ups and cool downs, and running myself to the ground everytime I was in the gym. I proceeded to ignore all the warning signs (in essence, pain), and before I knew it my climbers elbow was here to stay. And unlike before, I couldn't seem to rehab it at all. 

Simply put, my volume was way more than my current capacity for recovery (because of work). 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now I did say this would be a positive post, and I am happy to report that my climber's elbow, while not completely resolved, is *almost* fully recovered. Almost. I can climb at peak performance, without pain, as long as I match my volume to my recovery capacity (which has involved drastically reducing my time spent in the bouldering gym, but also drastically increasing the time spent focusing on my weak points and doing my pre-hab exercises).

This is because i've left residency. I still work as a doctor in internal medicine, but I am no longer in a training programme. I won't go into the details because this isn't about my career, but lets just say my working hours are much more civilized than they used to be. 

**TLDR:** **if you made it this far, thanks for reading. If you just want to see what worked for me, start reading from here.**

1. Taking 2 months off climbing. This isn't really necessary from a rehab perspective, but I did it because I legitimately had a very tough time trying to get rid of the mindset I had when I was in residency, which was that I had to maximize every session to the point of exhaustion. During these 2 months I was still actively working out, but targeting common weak areas and focusing on other areas of injury prevention. Plenty of antagonist training (pushups, overhead press, triceps), hip openers, calf training (more for knee and ankle stability) etc. Doing these antagonist exercises alone made my elbow feel a lot better.
2. Religiously using my theraband(s) after each workout. No climbers elbow recovery guide would be without some form of eccentric training. Initially I used the red theraband for higher reps, and this alone would cause significant discomfort. I've now moved onto the blue theraband. Higher intensity lower rep eccentrics have usually worked well for me in the past, and now that my injury is much better, this still seems to be the case. I will say that there IS such a thing as too much, especially in the early days, so don't feel the need to go crazy with the theraband or eccentrics or whatever from the get go. If it is a rest day for me, I don't do my elbow rehab either.
3. Preparing most of my meals so that I get adequate protein, carbs etc. I now weigh 73-74kg depending on the day, but I still climb at the same grade. The difference is I feel MUCH better on the wall, and just healthier in general. I'm a pretty lanky guy, but I do put on muscle reasonably easily and so once I start to get some proper nutrition in my weight tends to just climb up. I don't really care though, but I wrote this down to illustrate that lighter doesnt always = better in climbing. 
4. Being accountable for my training volume. Some weeks i'm in the gym 5-6x a week, however this doesn't mean I am going hard or climbing every time. For example, Monday might be legs/plyometrics, knee and ankle prehab etc and no climbing/upper body stuff. Next day might be an upper body strength workout, and then rest, followed by a short bouldering session the day after etc. This is really just trial and error but I essentially planned my entire week/volume, and stuck to it no matter what. Even if I felt like I could do more, I just called it quits once the workout was done. Of course, you have to be realistic about the week's worth of volume otherwise you can still overtain.
5. High intensity, low volume. After some time, I was pretty much pain free at rest, and my elbow would only hurt if I wasn't properly warmed up. This is where I started to re-introduce bouldering into my weekly volume. The key for me is that I would still climb hard problems (for me), but as soon as performance dipped and I couldn't give 100% in an attempt, I would call the session and proceed with my usual cool down/rehab and go home. At the start, this meant that I might only have 4 attempts on a problem before I felt like my performance was dipping, or my elbow was being stressed a bit too much, and i would just end it.

TLTLDR:

\- Volume/recovery balance is the key to remaining injury free

\- High intensity low volume worked for me, but may not necessarily work for you. Rehab injury is very specific to an individual and requires a lot of trial and error. 

\- Chronic injuries require a lot of care and attention to rehabilitate, and while this is an extreme example, I only found the time to really give it the attention it deserves by quitting my job. (climbing wasn't the reason why I quit my job)

\- If someone is in the same scenario as me with work/life balance, I would refrain from adopting the same mindset I had and go HAM everytime you're in the gym/outdoors just because it's something which you enjoy. Injuries aren't worth it, so be mindful of your volume.
Bouldering training plan critique Been bouldering for 2 years, v4-5 flash level, v6-7 hard project. Would really like to send a v8 + need to increase all out Max power/ ability to do very hard moves. I have pretty decent endurance don't need to work on that. Ideally I would like to spend all time training outside on actual boulders rather than doing gym stuff. This is a routine that I feel may work for me but I would love to hear other opinions.
Monday: hard boulder project. V6- v8 grade range. more of a power endurance focus with 8-12 moves for 5-6 attempts 15 - 30 minutes rest in between goes. 
Tuesday: rest day.
Wednesday: hard Boulder project.  V6-8 grade range. All out Max power focus 3-8 moves for 7-10 goes. 10-20 minutes rest in between attempts. 
Thursday: rest day.
Friday: milage session. Pick four boulders at v4-5 grade range. These can be flashes or repeats. Try to make them all have different hold type/ number of moves.  2 goes per boulder. Try to either flash/ repeat with Better technique. If you send, try to send again, otherwise, just Rip another attempt. 10-20 minutes rest in between. 
Saturday: rest
Sunday: rest.
Also will perform antagonist ( dips trx, pushups) after each session. 
As a general rule for projects, I will continue working as long as I am progressing. 3-4 weeks no progress, pick a new one.  Please, any feed back and tips would help.
An all-in-1 climbing training logbook for the r/climbharder community Hey everyone,

January is usually when we're setting big goals and I thought it would be a good time to share a massively updated climbing logbook. 

This works as an all-in-1 google doc that you can copy to your own drive and edit as you like. It's divided into four main sections:

* **Your stats**: personal bests, fitness tracker.
* **Looking forward**: your goals, your bucket list of climbs.
* **Self-test**: 9c test, weaknesses self-assessment.
* **Logs**: yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily and per session logs.

Most of the tabs are easily printable (eg in a binder book) if you prefer filling your logbook with a pen.

[Click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18hoZb5ZopO8P18SxIiz6seronM6kCGDoqss0trYo6Ms/edit?usp=sharing), then click 'file', then 'copy' and save it to your drive.

I hope this is useful to some of you!
Climbing and supplements/PEDs Hey y’all! So I’m curious, what do you guys think about supplements, and even PEDs, when it comes to climbing?

I started climbing about two years ago, and it has since become my main sport. But before that, my background was in general fitness and bodybuilding/physique. And in that world, supplements are ubiquitous - basically everybody takes at least preworkout and creatine, if not some huge stack of supps. Even PEDs are fairly commonplace, with probably about half the guys I lifted with cycling testosterone. 

Since becoming a climber, it seems like people largely either don’t use supps/PEDs, or at least they don’t talk about it. Like, I often take preworkout before climbing because it just gives me that extra energy to climb just a little harder, but even that seems to get weird looks sometimes. Anybody got any insight to why that is?

And on a more relevant topic - do any of y’all use supps or PEDs? Do you find they help your performance as a climber? Would you recommend any particular stacks or substances?
A story about how I diagnosed my wrist issue + advice for recovery Around 9 months ago, I developed wrist pain after a climbing session that never went away. The pain wasn't associated with a particular trigger event, but was more likely the result of overuse over the course of a session, and continuing to work a project a bit longer than I should have after I noticed the pain beginning to onset.

I saw a GP and got an X-ray and ultrasound. These showed no issue, so I was referred to a hand therapist who couldn't work out what was wrong. I was then referred to a physio who specialised in climbers, who also couldn't work out what was wrong. I asked my GP for an MRI, but they refused, saying it wouldn't show anything and that I could go back to my usual active routine. I said that the pain was enough to prevent me from my usual routine, but I didn't feel like they took me seriously.

8 months after this, with the pain still present despite a 1 month break from climbing, I asked again for an MRI, but was again refused. I sought a third opinion at a different GP clinic, and was finally given a referral for an MRI. The MRI showed that I had a wrist ligament sprain. I'm not going to see a physio armed with this information to hopefully get a plan for recovery.

It's incredibly frustrating to think that two separate GPs said that an MRI would show nothing, when in fact it did. I feel like I've lost 8 months. I guess this is a cautionary tale, if nothing else.

As for recovery, if anyone has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated.
How Do I Rediscover The Love? I've been climbing for long enough that it's become a big part of my identity. I guided last summer. I dedicate basically every vacation to it. I even live in a van full time. And I totally just don't have the fire. I dread going to the gym because I know I'm going to suck because my head's just not there.

I'm just coming out of a pretty dark time in my life. I had a couple stints in a psych ward, a suicide attempt, and a month in a rehab clinic. During all that time I've eaten like shit and gotten way out of shape. I'm doing better now but my confidence is still just absolutely shot.

I used to love hitting the gym at night and consequently I wanted to eat right and treat my body well so I could climb harder. Now I hate the way my body looks and every time I work out I just get so mad at myself for letting myself go this much.

I know that's a lot. Sorry.

I guess I'm just wondering how I go back to loving climbing like I used to. Does anybody have any similar experience and can give me some advice? Don't get me wrong, I feel genuinely lucky just to be alive, but I want my passion back.
Finger training structure in preparation for comp and trip to Rocklands (need advice) In March I will be competing in nationals and in June I will go to Rocklands for 1 month. I want to try to structure my training to peak for Rocklands, but be in pretty good shape for the comp aswell if possible.

In Rocklands I'd like to try to climb my first V11, but if I don't find one that is doable without spending the entire trip on only that boulder, then I'd rather get som milage in at a V6-V10 grade range and have a good time. (First long outdoor trip)

In preparation for this trip, I want to get a fair bit stronger in most aspects of my climbing. Max power in upper body, abdominal strength, strength endurance, stamina, cramped body positions, intricate body positioning and route reading are some of my weaknesses at the moment. Finger strength is not my bottleneck right now, but it is regardless something that I believe you should work on consistently (at an intensity where it doesn't affect your on the wall training too much), because it takes a long time to develop.

I have read quite a bit about different hangboard protocols and just read Eva Lopez study on max hangs and repeaters and this raised a few questions for me:
- Why did the study have a group doing Max hangs for 4v, then repeaters for 4v after instead of the other way around?
- Is minimal edge hangs worth it in preparation for a trip to Rocklands?

I have only done max hangs before, and last March I did 170% BW, 7sec on Lattice 20mm, but I doubt I have improved much on that benchmark since then. I can probably do 160-170% now if I were to guess, but I recently started doing 7:3 repeaters for the first time. In order for me to finish 6 sets of 6 reps each 7:3 repeaters, I have to do them at bodyweight on a 20mm edge and I reach failure the last rep of the last set. According to the Crimpd app, I should be able to add 25kg on repeaters for 5 sets based on my max hang benchmark, which seems completely ridiculous to me at my current level. Here are some of my questions:

- Do you think I have I found a glaring weakness worth attending to?
- If I want to be in peak shape in 4 months, should I just work repeaters or should I do max hangs aswell?
- All my hangboard work has been done on the Lattice 20mm edge. Should I change the edge size to 10-14mm for max hangs to introduce some new stimuli?
- I currently have Golfer's elbow, started 3 weeks ago ish and I rehab consistently, but symptoms are pretty much the same/varies a little day to day. Can and should I adapt my finger training around this?

- In November-December I had a projecting phase lasting 8 weeks, then I started doing repeaters at the beginning of January and planned to do it for 5 weeks, then do max hangs for 4 weeks until March before the comp. This might be a bad idea from what I have read so far. Should I keep doing repeaters for a full 8 weeks until the end of February, deload before the comp, do the comp, then do max hangs for 8 weeks instead?

The year would look like this:

- Jan: Repeaters 4v
- Feb: Repeaters 4v
- Mar: Bouldering comp 10-11th, Max Hangs 3v
- Apr: Max hangs 4v, Outdoor bouldering
- May: Repeaters 4v, Outdoor bouldering
- June: Rocklands all month


If any of you have any advice for preparing for a trip that is just not finger training, I'd love to hear that aswell. Building work capacity for an example. Input much appreciated.
Cheers!

Info about me:
I have been climbing for 3 years, max boulder V10 indoors, flashgrade V6-8 and max boulder V9 outdoors. 23 year old male, no training history before climbing, 190cm tall, 74kg. I like crimps and cutlooses.
Weak in closed-shoulder positions I have come to learn a relative weakness of mine, and I'm curious to know if other people have (a) felt a similar thing in their own climbing, (b) have noticed it in other people's climbing, and (c) have insights to offer on this.

I have observed that, compared to pretty much all other people climbing in my approximate grade range (V7-9 boulder), I am somewhat strong in open-shoulder positions but somewhat weak in closed-shoulder positions. I define open/closed-shoulder positions based on the angle between my upper-arm and the plane of my torso. [Here is a diagram](https://imgur.com/FLrvWTP) to illustrate: 

https://preview.redd.it/pf98mxprhoea1.jpg?width=1415&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8f052d6b1874acfc24cecbf343138ba3edf37098

The grey dotted lines represent my upper-arm, i.e. the line starting from my shoulder socket and passing through my elbow. This mostly pertains to pulling, but also pushing/compressing to a lesser degree. Of course there is a lot more nuance than this illustration suggests - there are still all the various orientations of my lower-arm, wrists, application of force, etc.. But broadly this illustration seems to be true.

How this manifests in my climbing is, I am pretty bad at twisting in climbing, but pretty good at square climbing. It's very common for me to be able to do wide gastons that many of my V6-9 friends can't, but then totally struggle on twisting moves that those same friends do without much trouble. After much analysis I have boiled it down to the illustration above - that I am weaker when doing moves in closed-shoulder positions, and stronger in open-shoulder positions.

I've been working on this weakness by being very intentional when it comes to twisting in climbing. I think a large part of this issue may simply be habit and perspective. I am considering experimenting with a bit of accessory weight training, since I'm currently dialing back my climbing due to other life commitments. 

So yeah... any ideas or relatable experiences? Any recommendations for movement drills or exercises? Or maybe there is some important detail I'm missing?
Struggling between Mini Moonboard or Kilter Home Wall for a home board I climb V8 max, V7 max flash (I know I should project more). I am looking to get a home wall and only have 8ft ceilings so I’m picking between these two. I will be running either at 40 degrees.
  
Mini Moonboard is:  
-	way cheaper ($2k including shipping and lights vs $8k for kilter)
-	more climbs and routes set
-	benchmarks

Kilter Home Wall has:  
-	More climbing area and taller climbing area
-	More holds to pick from (meaning easier to warm up with as well)

I’ve used a full moonboard with 2017 set at my local gym and I enjoyed it. The big moves were fun, but from the ones I did across a few sessions, it didn’t seem to have as much variety in the style. The holds were also pretty rough on the fingers, but I know the mini set has mostly wood holds which seem to be better. At the end of the day though, it was really addicting and I already felt myself getting better at it.  
  
I’ve never used a kilter board before, however, I don’t think that would translate well since I heard the home wall has much better hold variety than the juggy commercial wall. The kilter LEDs are definitely the more luxury experience and the holds look more varied. This also makes it seem like there will be more options for easier climbs for warmups. Warming up on the 2017 V3 moonboard problems wasn’t too big of a problem (after stretches and a bit of hangboard), but I’d be concerned a bit if the mini moonboard’s easiest was more like a V5 equivalent.  
  
Anyone get a chance to try either of these home boards and have any comparison or thoughts?
Left Hanging on the Hangboard Here I am, a hangboarding hangboarder and I'm left wondering if I have the right approach.

I think that the question "how do I climb harder?" is often unhelpful. It's helpful with the follow-up questions, like "how do I climb x route?" or "how can I improve (measurable goal)?" Otherwise one is just shadowboxing the opponent of "climbing harder" with no measurable progress and undoubtedly getting their ass handed to them.

Being of that mind, I have reached a level of progress that to improve I need to switch up my approach. Since I have switched it up in this new year, I have seen a great deal of progress in my outdoor climbing. Doing HIIT, doing workouts on the rings, running when I can, hang boarding and the 1-2 cragging days/week has worked well for me this winter. However, when I was hangboarding today I said to myself "I wish I was better at hangboarding" I immediately kicked myself because not once have I made a goal. I then realized that I don't know well enough the different disciplines within hangboarding to make well-informed goals for my workout.

Currently, I do four sets of 10sec 5x reps, gradually decreasing my mm. If I do that forever, my body will just be used to the abuse. As far as climbing goals, I feel competent at making my own goals (although it would be helpful to have a better ropes partner). When it comes to hangboarding, I'm at a loss. I guess the structure that I am looking for would fall into these categories:

* Max hang (weight) How do you split up your workout?
* Max hang (length) How do you split up your workout?
* How do you work up to one-hand hangs?
* Three-finger drag/one finger pockets/slopers - worth training?
* Do you work all 3 grips, open, half and full crimp? (I only train half crimp, as it's what I find myself doing when actually on the wall)
* How do you divide your sets/reps/rests to break things up for different endurance and strength goals?
* Reaching complete failure?
* Frequency of workout/rest/proximity to outside days in the week?

As far as tendon health, I have had a flexor tendon injury in the past that came about while playing upright bass for jazz band and being a new climber. Probably ebbed away after 3 years and haven't had any major tendon injuries and try to stay well hydrated to mitigate injury. Tendon endurance and resilience might be my forté, just not necessarily strength. I full crimp a lot with no complaints of pain, so maybe that will help with recommendations.

Such a cool community to be a part of here in r/climbharder... nothing but positivity and inclusivity from you folks. Thanks in advance for helping my direction here as I hope and aim to improve my abilities.
What felt like cheating to you? What training can you pinpoint to in relation to your climbing progress and say, "Wow, that made such a massive help with such minimal effort, I can't believe I didn't do it sooner?" Please share where you were as a climber at that time, keep it brief, and don't try and sell me a bucket of green powder.

For me, it was very basic hang-boarding (like ten reps of 10 sec hang, 50 second rest on a 10-12mm edge, 2x a week) when I was bouldering around V5 and breaking into 5.12. That simple amount of hangboarding definitively helped push me into v7/8, 5.12/5.13- sport climbing very quickly (I'd say about 1.5 years, in conjunction with normal gym sessions climbing 3-4x week). 

The second thing, much later in climbing for me, was resting more than two days at a time. If I want to send hard (for me this means double digit boulders atm) after as little as 4 weeks of climbing/training 3-4 as a week; taking 5 days off without any climbing at all means I'm constantly peaking when I get back on the wall. So this really feels like cheating, because I'm just enjoying myself outside the climbing gym (there's more to life folks!). Note that I can't apply this to only climbing outside because I haven't been able to do that for over 10 years and I'm 34 now. The dirtbag years, sadly, are over for me. 

Bonus points (for selfish reasons) if you have anything that felt like cheating for the jump from v10 to v/12, or 5.13+ to 5.14.
Hey everyone, I’m doing a survey for correlations between strength metrics and max boulder grade. It should only take a few min to fill out, I’d greatly appreciate it
Is a home wall worth it if you have a gym to climb at? I am thinking about getting a Kilter Homewall, but not sure if it would be worth it. I live 25-30 minutes away from my home gym. Gym is big, has a big spray wall, and a moonboard that I’ve been using more and more lately (although it’s often in use).  
  
I consistently go 3-4 times a week for 2-3 hours each session and do strength at home about once a week. If I got a home wall, I could have some short easy sessions on “rest days” and could also potentially take out a gym day for a home day which could be helpful when I’m busy. That said I’m still questioning if it’s useful.  
  
I think what made me want a home wall was trying the moonboard for the first time. My gym is huge and there are cool problems, but at the same time, that makes it hard to find projects and progress. I feel like there are too many and too few problems at the same time. Just really cool to have a ton of variety of problems to work from and still have the ability to set things based on your weaknesses. Spray wall is good too, but having the huge catalogue gives you something to do when you just wanna go through climbs.
  
For those who have home walls, how do you find it fits into your climbing?
Extreme variance in finger strength day to day? I've been climbing for about a year now, and recently (november) started engaging more with structured training via a Lattice Lite plan. I'm doing exclusively bouldering, with fingerboard work limited to twice a week (one day max hangs, one day repeaters). Note that I have very weak fingers, hence the low weights.

In addition to the programmed hanging, I will often warm up for a session with a quick hang progression to get myself warm;  typically hanging with two feet on, then one foot on, then deadhanging with open hand, then deadhanging half crimp.

Because of this, I've noticed that my finger strength shows extreme variability between sessions, seemingly independent of anything else. 

Sometimes I can finish my max 10s hangs on 20mm with 25lbs added easily, and warm up hanging on 15mm for 10-15s very comfortably. Other sessions I cannot even hang bodyweight on 20mm at all, no matter how warm I am or how hard I try. This feels independent of any factor that makes sense; it happens on any given day, or even after multiple consecutive rest days. Its incredibly frustrating. Is this normal? Has anyone else dealt with this?

I'm a 30yr old male, 5'8, ~160 with a multi-year olympic lifting background, if that helps for anything.
Nuance to the Three Finger Drag (sloth grip) I stumbled on this video by Makoto Yamauchi discussing three-finger drag (Admittedly I used youtube's auto-translate from Japanese to English to try to understand what was going on so if anyone knows what's going on better please elaborate). [https://youtube.com/watch?v=XfYPA2bJe9E&amp;feature=shares](https://youtube.com/watch?v=XfYPA2bJe9E&amp;feature=shares)

From what I understand the takeaway is that three-finger drag isn't as passive of a grip position as you would think. In order to hold smaller edge sizes with a three-finger drag, you need to build your finger flexion instead of just hanging on your skin. This is kind of intuitive maybe for a half-crimp. I start with a more aggressive crimp and let the load on the finger open my crimp to about 90 degrees for hangs and consider that a half crimp. But I never thought to take the same approach with three-finger drag or a more openhanded grip. 

Around 14:23 he shows a mind-boggling feat of strength by hanging one-handed three-finger drag on a beastmaker 2000 middle edge and can even flex his hand under that load.

Around 8:54 he shows an exercise to build three-finger drag flexion (scalable with feet on the ground)

I'm curious about what others think about this. I hadn't run into this in English-speaking climbing youtube content or anywhere here.
How do I maintain mental health while dealing with chronic injury Not even sure where to start with this post...I guess I'll explain a bit about my situation.

I'm in my early-mid 30's and have been climbing for about 4 years now.  In just a short time, climbing has become everything to me.  I have other hobbies, some of which in the past I've considered to be an *important par*t of my sense of self.  But none of them come close to the passion I have for climbing.  Like I said, it's **everything**.  You can't ask me about how I see myself, or how I want my future to be without mentioning climbing.   I don't think this is an unfamiliar concept in this subreddit.

I guess the details of my injuries aren't that important.  Around April of last year I started developing some medial epiconylitis.  Around July my left big toe started hurting after I climbed/hiked.  I got a dog in April 2022 so started walking a lot more.  Kept climbing as usual.  In December it became too much - I go to a specialist and am diagnosed with sesamoiditis.

Since then I've:

1. hangboarded - greatly aggravates my golfers' elbow
2. climbed with one foot - obviously hard on the elbow (especially as I've worked up to 5.11- in the gym)

Recently, my right big toe (the good one) started hurting like crazy.  I've since stopped all climbing.  My right one feels okay to walk on now, but the left is has good days and terrible days.

I won't sugarcoat this - I'm wondering if I want to live if I can't climb.  Like I said above, climbing is everything to me.  My life in general hasn't been fantastic.  But then I find something I truly **love** and after less than 4 years, it's ripped from me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a therapist; I'm not making any rash decisions.  At the same time...I feel like giving up.  It's not like I adhere to some insane, elite training regimen.  I wear snug shoes that aren't insanely tight.  I just fucking climb a few days a week, but my body is determined to not let that happen.  Because of this, I'm worried that I'll just always deal with this.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I wanted to start this thread to get some advice because I'm really hurting right now.  I'm terrified of having the greatest love of my life taken from me.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
Edit: Thank you all for your comments.  I read each one and your advice and encouragement mean a lot to me.  This post was me at my worst and I'm glad to say I'm feeling slightly less defeated today.  I talked with my therapist and took my dog for a long visit to the dog park.  I'm going to step away from Reddit for a bit, but may reply to comments again in a few days.
Is weight training worth it? I’m at the weirdest plateau of my life. 

I think my fingers are stronger than the rest of my muscles.

I’m 6’1” and 140lb and I’ve been climbing for about 2 years and I’m torn between gaining weight and putting muscle on or continue spending my time specifically focused on climbing and climbing workouts (circuits, spray wall, system board, and general projecting) .

I’m currently 5.12/12+ lead climber and a v7/8 boulderer.

Getting to 5.13a/V9 has been the worst.

I can pull on crimps like my life depends on it (it often does) but the second I have a committing dead point, or a shoulder heavy move, or heavy compression I struggle. Even if it’s in a lower difficulty climb.

I’m worried grade chasing has gone too far fellas. But I’m also scared that if I implement more training and less climbing I might regress and lose progress. 

I’m also worried about gaining weight unless it’s muscle/positive toward my climbing goals.

Is it worth it to implement things such as bench press, curls etc. 

Or how can I implement that in a healthy way where I’m not over doing it either?

So if anyone has any input I would love to hear it. 

P.S. I am a broke college kid but I have access to a gym with climbing training gear and regular workout equipment.

Update: Eating a protein bar, and maybe coming to terms with an eating disorder
What Makes Matt Fultz and Jimmy Webb So Special (Heaviest to do V16?) One of my buddies just sent me this [screenshot of Matt saying he's 5'11" and 170 lbs.](https://imgur.com/a/bMrE2um) (\~180cm and 77kg)

[Height and weight of Jimmy Webb](https://imgur.com/a/qR9x2Rq) (\~183cm and 78kg / 6" and 171lbs)

From my experience, I have quite literally never seen anyone *WELL* over 150lbs climbing a V16 let alone a V15 at that weight and at that height. The only person that I can think of is probably Jan Hojer who climbed a V15, but he's 6'2".

Compare those to let's say Daniel Woods, who's \~140lbs (63kg), Shawn Rabatou, definitely less than 140lbs ( &lt; 63kgs), Nalle Hukkataival (\~150lbs/68kgs), and a ton of Japanese climbers that are clearly way less than 140lbs/63kgs, Matt and Jimmy are almost like bodybuilders.

Questions I have are:

1. How are they able to climb such insanely high grades being that heavy relative to the majority of climbers around that height at their level who are 20-30lbs lighter?
2. Could they possibly lose a lot of muscle mass since they are already very lean and possibly climb even harder?
The outcome of a mixed-strength training and climbing routine Many folks have been interested in integrating strength training into their climbing routines but have been unsure what results they might see and whether they'd be worth it. I completed Steve Bechtel's mixed strength training and climbing plan from his latest book. Here are my results.

**My background:**

* Climbing for 7 years around  V7/5.12a indoors.
* I generally climb 3 - 4 days per week.
* I mostly bounder indoors and trad climb outdoors.

**Motivation for doing a strength regiment:**

* After recovery from a serious injury to my finger a few years ago, my left hand has been chronically weak and limiting on left-hand focused routes.
* My general fitness has felt weak compared to other points in my climbing career.

**Metrics before regiment:**

* Height: 5'10"
* Weight: 152.5 lbs, 12.2% body fat
* Hand Strength:
   * Left hand: 86.2 lbs
   * Right Hand: 102.6 lbs
   * Combined grip strength to body weight ratio: 124%

**Regiment:**

* 5 days a week of workouts for 4 weeks.
   * 2 days of weight lifting and hangboarding.
   * 3 days of climbing.
      * The climbing was split into a normal session, a high-volume session, and an easy session.
      * A 'normal' session for me was 12 - 15 indoor bouldering routes climbed. Most boulders were v5 and below. A few of these boulders were harder, in the v7 range. High volume sessions were the same, but increased the number of boulders by 10%. So, 13 - 16 boulders. On easy days, I generally climbed below v5 and maybe only 10ish routes depending on how I was feeling.

My lifts:

- Pull ups @ 3 sets of 5 reps and increased to 8 reps in the second half of the regiment
  - I started with 0 lbs added and increased this to 15 lbs by the end of the cycle.
- Walking Lunges @  3 sets of 5 reps, later 8 reps
  - Started at 25 lbs dumbbells and ended at 40 lbs dumbbells
- Dumbel Row  @ 3 sets of 5 reps, later 8 reps
  - Started at 40 lbs dumbbells and ended at 55 lbs dumbbells
- Seated Straight leg raise @  3 sets of 10 reps, later 12 reps
- Pistol Squats  @ 3 sets of 5 reps, later 8 reps
  - I did not increase weight throughout the program
- Ab wheel rollout  @ 3 sets of 5 reps, later 8 reps
  - I did not increase weight throughout the program

Hangbaord protocol used:

- Max hangs:
  - The first half of the program:
    - 6 rounds on a 25mm edge for 10s with 50s rest.
    - Followed by 6 rounds on a 20mm edge for 5s for 55s rest.
  - The second half of the program:
    - 6 rounds on a 25mm edge for 15s with 45s rest.
    - Followed by 6 rounds on a 20mm edge for 8s for 52s rest.
  - I started the program with 0 lbs added and was able to progress to 10 lbs.


**Metrics after regiment:**

* Weight:
   * 154.4 lbs, 12.4% body fat
      * Added 1.3 lbs of lean body mass and 0.6 pounds of fat.
* Hand Strength:
   * Left hand: 78.8 lbs **(-8%)**
   * Right Hand: 84.5 lbs **(-18%)**
   * Combined grip strength to body weight ratio: 106%

**Things that surprised me about the routine:**

* I ultimately finished the routine feeling much stronger and more confident on routes. I didn't expect this from such a short program.
* Throughout the program, I was continually able to add more load to my weight-lifting exercises. It was great to see strength increase over this period.
* My hand strength actually decreased significantly after the regiment, the opposite of my goals.
   * Does anyone know why this might be the case?
   * It seems crazy to me that I would get weaker after hangboarding and climbing for four weeks. The only explanation that I can think of is that I'm overtrained, but that seems unlikely because of how short this regiment was.
* I built up a much larger work capacity than I ever have.
   * 5-days a week of hard sessions was **way more intense** than climbing 4 days a week because it forces you to have multiple days without a rest day. This was incredibly challenging at first, but my body adapted and performed much better than I expected.
* The workouts were intense enough that I had workout 'hangovers' the next day.
   * I'll address this in my next cycle by increasing my calories around training to ensure my body can recover more fully.
* According to my scale, I peaked during the regiment at 156.2 lbs and 12.1% body fat and had multiple weigh ins around this range.  
   * This meant that my scale believed I had an increase of 3.6 lbs of LBM. 
   *  I didn't 'lose' this weight later on, it's likely that my smart scale was just bad at calculating body fat, given some environmental conditions. It's a great reminder not to put too much stock into smart scales and their reports.

*Edit*: added more details about the regiment.
Huge Discrepancy Between Max Hang &amp; Density Hang results I'm able to hang +48kg on 20mm edge for 7s half crimp (at 72kg bw so 120kg total or 166%). But I can't hang 30 seconds bodyweight on the same 20mm edge. I fail every time at around 23 seconds due to my hands opening up. I did these tests separately, after a rest day so it wasn't due to pre fatigue. I'm primarily a boulderer, mostly on a woody board or boulders at my limit in the gym, or outdoors when possible

Is max strength capped by the longer duration ability and would it be worth me targeting this weakness if my goal is purely bouldering? and is there a way I can do so on the wall?
Repeaters and power phase, counterproductive? So I’ve been searching the sub for some answers but seem to be getting mixed responses from people so thought I would pose the question here. 

(For reference: f22, climbing for 7years, v5 benchmarks on moonboard 2019, climbing about V7-8 in the gym sets which are prob soft, I can do like 5 pull ups with 30lb around 25% of my body weight) 

I started the fall with a strength phase and did 6 weeks of minimum edge hangs, which resulted in some crazy gains. I went from hanging like 7 seconds on the 16mm to the 8mm. I know the next logical step was to start hanging on the 20 and add weight but I was feeling kind of sick of how long the finger workout was taking so I decided to change it up and do a phase of repeaters. Right now I’m doing 7/3 on the bottom BM rung in half crimp open and 3fd twice a week. It’s only been 2 weeks so hard to say if I’m making any gains but it seems like I can pull in open crimp for a whole boulder without getting too fatigued, which normally I’d be full crimping everything. 

The problem is, I’m mixing my repeaters with a 6 week power phase, which the repeaters are probably better suited for an endurance phase. Power phase is pretty much involving low rep explosive pull ups to my chest, 1 arm negatives or hammer curls, projecting powerful boulders and a bit of campusing on the spray wall jugs . 

So would my finger training be better if I did some kind of contact strength training on the campus board or max hangs? I can barely campus tbh I was mostly doing 1-3-4 and not with great form which is why I decided to work on explosive pull ups and campusing on jugs first.
Advice for going beyond v4/v5 for a heavy climber. I have been bouldering on a hobby basis (once or twice a week) for a couple of years. It's really fun, but for the past few months I feel like I have made pretty much no progress.

I weight about 220lbs and I am 6ft 4inches tall, so I know that loosing some weight will be beneficial. I do plan to cut back a bit, my goal is 10-20lbs down in the next 4 months.

In the meantime, is there something else that would be beneficial to do if I want to get better? 

My overall strength level is good (I have been doing strength training for much longer than bouldering), when I feel like my grip on the holds is good I can pretty much do the moves I need to. Where I feel like I am starting to really struggle is both finger strength and overall technique. On the higher grades the holds in my gym seem to pretty much change to holds where I don't stand a chance to even do the first move of most problems. The gap from these grades to the higher ones just seem so much harder than the previous ones for me.

Should I try a hangboard program? Because of my weight I have been a bit scared of tendon injuries, so I have avoided the hangboard so far.

Edit: Thank you everyone, there is a lot of great advice that I am going to try out over the next months here. I'll try to be systematic and come back with an update post after a number of training sessions.
How do you train for precision dead point moves? I just came back for a trip where I met my nemesis move again. I call it the precision dead point move. It's a move that I come across in Boulder problems from time to time and has stopped me from sending once again. This time it was especially frustrating because it wasn't even the crux. I did the crux over and over again just to fall on that stupid move going to a side pull slot which you have to get just with the right amount of momentum. In the end I had to bail because my skin was completely trash from overshooting and undershooting the move and hitting everything but the hold. I did the move maybe 1 out of 10 attempts.

I can lock off going for holds and I can dyno going for holds but I really struggle going there with the right amount of momentum and I was wondering if any of you had any advice how to train that. It's not a strength thing and I try to make up replicas on a spray wall but since I can't set up the hold in a commercial gym the way I want I'm limited. Any other ideas?
Weight lifting in climbing At what point will weight lifting be beneficial for climbing? I've been climbing for 2 years and would consider myself a solid v7/8 climber. I'm 5'11 and weigh 140-145 pounds. I think the muscle groups I have for climbing like fingers, forearms, back, and core are pretty decent for the grade I'm climbing, but I feel that my other areas are extremely underdeveloped, like my chest, glutes, hamstrings, calves, etc... Is there any benefit in training those? If so, how should I schedule it between my climbing sessions without compromising the quality of my climbing sessions? I mostly climbing 3 days a week, sometimes 4. Should I be training for hypertrophy (high reps) or strength (low reps)? My climbing philosophy is that as long as I still see progress without training off the wall, I'll just continue to climb only. I feel that training antagonists is an exception to that rule, but do you think this is a flawed way of thinking and that I should do some pulls, core workouts, and hangboard/campus sessions if my goal is to progress as fast as possible?
How do you keep diet from becoming overwhelming when you train? I'm aware this is a question that could be suited for a number of different subreddits/professionals, but I feel like this community is the most likely to have people who've had a similar struggle/are able to provide useful guidance.

The basic issue is: food is incredibly overwhelming for me. I do not understand what and how climbers eat.

I train 4x a week for about 3 hours a session; it is very easy to find stoke to do this. I love training, even on the worst days. When it comes to food, I am completely stymied, to the point where I will just get overwhelmed and not eat because I do not understand.

I am a 165# (75kg) male. My BMR is around 1800 calories, which is \*already\* an intimidating number to hit every day, to say nothing of the fact that my actual maintenance target is probably around 2400/2600.

That feels like my entire day, every day, is going to be nothing but eating and preparing food for the next meal. When do y'all work? Train? Do anything other than eat and make food?

If you start looking at macro targets, depending on who you ask, I should be getting around 80g to 120g of protein every day. So that's almost two entire entire blocks of super-firm tofu, every day . Forever. That is insane. Is this what everyone is doing? (I'm not strictly vegetarian; I just don't eat a lot of meat)

also, so 100g of protein is 400 calories. Cool. Even if I was just eating for BMR, that's still 1400 calories to make up with just carbs and fat. Where the heck is that all supposed to come from? Am I just supposed to be shoveling bread and cheese into my mouth constantly?

I spend so much time looking at different recipes trying to find ones that make \*enough food\* to both hit what feels like insane calorie requirements while also making sure I get enough pre-workout carbs and also making sure I get enough protein and vegetables also making sure all the six million other things are in order and it is \*exhausting\* and I usually just give up and don't eat until I just order food to eat \*something\*.

I am \*incredibly aware\* that this sounds insane and unhealthy (it definitely is) but I feel like I cannot be the only climber to butt up against this. What are y'all eating? How are you making sure you're not just constantly cooking/cleaning/eating/repeating all day every day?

I would really like to stop having sessions or climb days where I feel incredibly limited because I just can't get a handle on food.

\[yes, I have talked to therapists about this/other things. while they have been instrumentally helpful in many things, they have not been helpful with this\]
Training program for advanced level New to this sub, so just wanted to get a bit of insight.

I’m in school right now, and recently quit my main sport which I was doing at a collegiate level. I have been training climbing for many years (about 7), mainly as a side activity, but want to pour my efforts into improving now. I have a solid background (~30 sends of v10, with 1 v12 as my best outdoors)

For the last 6 months, I have been climbing about 4x a week (8 hours total), and am currently at the strongest level I think I’ve ever been. Sending the occasional 10 in the gym, with most 9s feeling workable within a session or two.

I’m hoping to train up to send a 13 this summer (Euro Roof Low in LCC), and wanted some advice on how to be training over the course of the next 6 months. I have the time now to be training as much as I think my body can tolerate, but I’m mainly trying to figure out how to break it up.

For reference, I am 6’2.5”, 170 pounds, with +3 ape index.

Current stats/abilities:
-very solid on crimps: nearing 200 pound pull on 20mm using Tension block, 140 pound with 10mm
-okay pull strength: 2 one arms at best, but only expect 1 regularly
-poor endurance: I never sport climb, but have good cardiovascular endurance from my previous sport. Don’t really know how much is necessary for bouldering

I’m decent at general weightlifting, and plan to train it semi-regularly (345S, 225B, 405D)

Any advice would be highly appreciated! Seems to me that the 2 biggest things are improving various kind of grip strengths and  my pull strength/endurance
Figuring out a training plan to break into V10. Hey guys,

Long time lurker. Have loved the content on here. I'm hoping that I can get a bit of feedback on my training plan as I haven't really done any training so far.

A bit of background, I'm 24m, 5'8 150lbs, started climbing in May 2021, had to take a 4 month break or so from June due to lockdown. For most of the first year I could only climb 2/3 times a week or my tennis elbow got too bad. 

From February to October last year I started religiously Kilter Boarding 1 day on 1 day rest, usually I'd also do uneven pull-ups and one arm push-ups on my training days.

In that time I progressed from V5/V6 max to scraping through my first V9("Exception" 50° on kilter) and completed a few V8s(one outdoors). My sessions would consist of projecting, I'd always project one grade above my current max and then do some regular indoor climbing once I wasn't strong enough to progress on my project(usually after an hour or so).

In late October I started route climbing more frequently and made very little bouldering progress in that time. I feel like maybe I'm slightly stronger but not too noticeable. Want to get back into progressing my bouldering so I've dropped the route climbing.


**TL:DR:**
I feel like my prior training was probably inefficient and included basically no off the wall training outside of pushups and pullups.

Was thinking of doing 2 cycles of the below and then taking a deload week and repeating.

Day	|Training
:--|:--:
1 |	Project
2 |	Indoor/Outdoor - Pushups
3 |	Rest
4 |	Limit Bouldering - Pull ups
5 |	Indoor/Outdoor - Pushups
6 |	Rest
7 |	Training(Pushups/Pullups/Hangboard(half crimp max hang)/Campus(train to get 1,5,9)
8 |	Rest
9 |	Project
10|	Indoor/Outdoor - Pushups
11|	Rest
12|	Limit Bouldering - Pushups
13|	Rest
14|	Rest

Also I'm going to allow myself to put 20 mins on my project any non-rest day, I just love projecting so much and my obsession with a climb wouldn't allow me to not touch it for a week.

Does this like a better training regime than my prior or am I overengineering it?

Thanks a tonne for reading, would love your feedback and apologies if this was too longwinded, just wanted to give all the context I could.
Apparently, I am clever and weak A bit earlier I did a strength metrics test with one of the better known climbing training coaches and got a chance to go over the results today.  The general conclusion was I am really weak pretty-much across the board except for pure finger strength. The results were significantly out-of-line for his dataset and I was actually asked me to send videos of my recent activity (since I restarted climbing last summer, I crawled 2 V9s and a bunch of V6s-V8s but also chuffed on a lot of stuff that should be doable for me). After taking a look, he quipped along the lines of "clever movement patterns is your only asset as a climber".

The general ranking of my weakness was

1. lock-off strength - at "V3-V4 climber level "
2. shoulders -  at "V5 or so"
3. explosive power - at "V5 or so"
4. eccentric contact strength - at "V6 or so"

Not that I am very surprised, but I am not sure how to restructure my training to deal with this. Since the whole illness thing, I've been having problems growing muscle mass and in general feel very fragile overall. Do I try to do a little strength training every day, with low weights and build it up? Do I dedicate a day to it specifically? Do I just incorporate some stuff addressing the extreme weaknesses into my micro-training rotation (I do 15-min fingers+stretching+prehab 2x a day)?

Appreciate any thoughts or ideas!

EDIT: After thinking about this, I took the plunge and (a) started doing pulling strength work on my own and (b) started doing a lifting session once a week with a coach. I don't intend to go back to this coach, but I will try to complete the same tests in a few months to see what changed.
Questions on the “Mostly Volume” training plan Someone in a thread yesterday mentioned that they train “mostly volume” as per [Steven Low](https://stevenlow.org/my-7-5-year-self-assessment-of-climbing-strength-training-and-hangboard/)

I recently moved and find myself in a situation conducive to this style of training. Namely, small gym , not very close to outdoor climbs. It has only a few hard boulders and an adjustable kilter board, so I’ve been mainly climbing volume on the kilter board in my sessions since I moved here. 

I do eventually want to set some longer term goals in the V10 range in Tahoe, Yosemite, and Red Rocks, but in the short term just want to develop my climbing strength and ability as best I can on the kilter board. 

My question is what angles should be training, and how long should each training session be? Should I be sticking to one angle (say 45), a small range of angles (40-50) or a large range (20-70)? I’m keeping my sessions relatively short(45 mins - 1 hour) but should I be pushing towards increasing session length as possible?
Meditations from a Sport Climber Facing some frustrations in my climbing progression. I have been a sport climber since the beginning, sprinkling in a gear phase and some bouldering. For me, sport is the most enjoyable. I have no problem with the other major disciplines, but the stoke is just there for rope climbing. In my rope climbing discipline I have flashed roped routes with v6+ cruxes, but the other day I was on what my buddy (who was FAing) was calling a V4 highball, and realized how comfortable the rope can make me. I have fallen plenty on ropes, sometimes on gear but probably thousands of times on bolts. This sort of experience and trusting my gear, I realized I may not have been facing fear at least on sport for a very long time. I don't worry about the exposure, the fall distance, or anything else because my experience has informed me of how considerably safe sport climbing can be.   


Back to the V4. I was getting to where my feet were probably 6ft above the pads, but the boulder continued another 7ft with the crux beginning on this pocket.. Some might not call that highball, but shut up because this is my meditation. I was getting to what felt like a really shallow sloped pocket and the only viable move from there is a 2.5 foot reach to a pebble. that much of exposure mixed with great feet made me real leery of slipping out of the pocket with no left hand while reaching, and landing backward head first because the feet may have caught on the way down. Considering my history with moves like this, they really shouldn't be a problem for me, but it was enough having to deal with the fall potential. Additionally, the moves working into the crux weren't nearly as hard but I wasted a lot of effort and gave a lot of attempts just because the top moves presented that mental block of both not having done them and the potential fall. 

When I go to the gym, I seldom rope climb and just boulder because I'm purposed in my training. Usually I have no fear falling in the gym either, but maybe applied the assumption that it would be similar if not the same outside. I was wrong. This might be the point that I get some pads and get stoked on bouldering so I can improve even further with my first love of sport climbing. 

Don't expect much from this thread, but perhaps it will help you reflect on your experience if you have experienced a similar mental block.
Strengthening serratus anterior for climbing movement patterns First off, big thanks to the community. I've been climbing and lurking on and off for almost a decade.

I'll try to keep this short (I failed). I've been climbing for almost a decade - boulderer. Been plateaued around V8-V9 for a few years. Just started taking training more seriously this last year or two.

I have had my fair share of overuse injuries - mostly elbows and shoulders. I have seen multiple PTs and taken recovery and strengthening imbalances seriously. Almost all of those injuries stem back to my shoulder hypermobility and weakness surrounding rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers. I have done the PT exercises, lots of my own research to adapt them to work better for the sport of climbing. All in all my back is stronger than it's even been.

The kicker: I just got a small little shoulder twinge (in my normally healthy shoulder). After some self videos and assessment, I can see that I am still not engaging my serratus anterior during overhead movements (scaption) as well on my left side. It takes so much conscious awareness to keep them "turned on". I then think what that would take to apply to the various movements done in hard climbing and it seems impossible.

My question is: does anyone else have experience with "offline" serratus anterior muscles and strengthening them for climb specific movements?

I've been programming serratus wall slides and loop band external rotation raises, experimenting with scapular "rows" on the climbing wall, etc. But I just want to climb hard and not over do it on my elbows and shoulders.

I know reprogramming old patterns is a long game... Any insight is much appreciated.
Training plan help Hey all. I have goals of reaching 5.12 and V7 this year. 29m 5’8 160

Currently my highest boulder is V6 (3x) and 11.B is my highest recent sport climb. Id done up to 11.d in the past but took a break from sport for 2 years.

Currently most recent can onsight 10a/b and can get 10C-11b single session.

No moves are ever very hard for me on sport but my headgame, technical fluidity, and pump management are all a work in progress (about 4-5 weeks back into sport)

My highest moonboard benchmark is v5. Ive completed all v3s from 2019, 11 v4, 2 v5.

Im currently climbing 4x per week. Ive worked in to this being my schedule the past few weeks

1 day is 7 on 53 off hangs, 1 set each for half crimp and open hand. Each set is 3 reps. Then 1:30 on 30 off endurance training on my wall.

Day 2 i moonboard v4s, which i can usually get 1-2 new ones asession lately.

Day 3 i do volume where i just repeat v3 benchmarks that feel 70% for me. I try to do around 12.

Day 4 i go outside and do sport usually, sometimes boulder.

I train at home. I have a moonboard, a traverse, and a hangboard


I plan on sticking with this plan and cutting down to 152-153 slowly through the year by dialing in my diet and increasing the general activity of my life style. Im fairly muscular so around there in 10% body fat and cant sustain leaner without it hurting my training or daily life.

Limiting factor for me has largely seemed to be finger injuries but i am 6 months injury free now.

How do you feel like my training aligns with my goals? 

Do you think i should change/add anything crucial that may help?

Does my intensity/volume seem high enough to reach my goals?
Prioritizing excess strength vs. endurance... Hello everyone. I am looking to get on a life-list project this coming summer and want to spend the next 3 months training to set myself up for success. I'd like to get some feedback on what to prioritize.

My project consists of linking a short v7ish (5 moves) into a long, power-endurance v10ish (14 moves) with an ok rest in between. The route is characterized by poor feet, but decent finger locks, 20-40 degrees overhung.

As far as my current fitness goes:  I can do about 70% of v10s I come across in a session, both crack and crimps. Have climbed a power endurance v11 in three sessions. Have climbed bouldery 13d crack in a few sessions.

I believe I sufficient strength for my project, and I know my biggest limiter at the moment will be power endurance. My question is: If you had three months to train, would you spend the large majority of the time focusing on power endurance? Or train strength even more so that the moves felt even easier and then slap on some power endurance about a month out? I am leaning toward the latter, also because I have some bouldering goals I need to get stronger for next winter as well.

Ignoring the finer details, my rough plan is:

March: Strength. Mostly limit bouldering, some weighted pull ups, some antagonist work. On the weekends, spend time outside getting mileage on v10 and solidifying v11 capabilities.

April: Similar to March, but start specifically chasing power-endurance boulders or short power endurance routes outside on weekends. I figure this will start to get me dialed on efficient movement, tactics, and trying hard when powered out.

May: Power endurance 2 days of the week, 1 day of strength maintenance, and 1 day of projecting power endurance boulders/routes outside.

June: Try the project.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? Stick to the plan outlined above or incorporate more endurance/power endurance sessions further out from June?
How can I improve my bouldering (V5/V6 climber) Hi all,

I’ve been bouldering 2-3X a week regularly since 2018, and I feel like I have made slow, consistent progress since then. What I’m looking for now is whether there is anything I can add to or focus on in my training to speed up my progression. Due to location I don’t have close access to outdoor bouldering, so all my training is indoors.

**Stats:** I’m 35 y/o male, 5’10’’ 150 lbs, with a skinny fat build. Started climbing at 30. I am currently climbing in the V5/V6 range in the gym, and I’ve gotten \~7-8 benchmark V4s and a couple V5s, which I’m pretty pleased with since I couldn’t even really start a V4 benchmark when I first got on the moonboard last summer. For hangboarding, I can hang my bodyweight + 20 lbs for 10s on a 20 mm edge. 

**Routine:** My current routine is to climb 3X per week, Tuesday and Thursday mornings, and once Saturday or Sunday. My current routine is as follows: warmup on easy boulders for \~30 mins, then work on V4/V5 moonboard benchmarks for 30 mins (3 mins rest between attempts), then I’ll work on gym projects in the V5-V7 range for 45 mins. I’ve been trying to focus on high-quality, high-effort attempts, though this is still something I’m working on. Usually on the weekend climbing day I’ll skip the moonboard and just work on gym projects. Within this structure, I try to keep a few principles in my mind while I’m climbing to help me improve. 1) Kill my ego. 2) Eat my veggies (boulders I consider out of my strengths, good for my pyramid) 3) Try hard, every time. It’s hard to maintain this focus all the time every time, but I’m working on this as well.

**Supplemental training:** Outside of climbing, I don’t really do much supplemental training. I consider upper body strength to be one of my biggest weaknesses (I can’t really campus anything all, only can do \~4-5 pull-ups), so 3X/week after climbing I’ll do a simple pull-up progression routine. Other than my upper body strength, I’m sure I could benefit from improved general fitness/strength, seeing how I don’t have a very athletic build, but I don’t have anything specific in my training to address this.

I know progress can be slow, and I do feel like I’m slowly improving. But I also feel like there must be something I can do to boost this progress. My goal this year is to climb V7 in the gym and V6 on the moonboard. Right now my temptation is to add a general bodyweight strength program to improve my overall strength/fitness, but I’ve hesitated in the past because I don’t want to take away from climbing-specific training or gains. 

I love reading the posts in this sub and I’d love to get your thoughts/feedback r/climbharder, thanks in advance!
Tips for conditioning fingers and avoiding overuse? I'll start off with some facts to my bouldering history to put my issue into context:

Been bouldering for bit over 5 years, consistently 3-5 times a week for 4,5 years, outdoor max grade is 7c/V9, I'd say I'm quite comfortably working 7b/V8 in one session. I'm not in a consistent additional training routine right now, I just do some injury prevention stuff from hoopers once a week after training, wich focuses on the shoulders mostly (had some rotator cuff problems when I started but they're fine now)

I had 4 weeks of complete climbing break last august due to surgery. When I got back into full capacity I was super motivated to train pulling hard, I tend to not always give it my all in my climbing, probably the main thing that's been holding me back so far haha

We would run through the new set quickly every session and then spend about an hour or 2 on the moonboard doing benchmarks, on the weekends when there is no new set we'd just do the moonboard part. That's been my routine since November I think

For the last 3 weeks I have been developing some discomfort in my fingers, namely the flexor digitorum in both middle fingers. It's kinda painful when I press down on it/massage it when my fingers are cold, but it feels normal once I'm warmed up. For the last two though sessions I could feel some tweaking while climbing and I felt like I couldn't really generate strength (aka I had two insanely weak sessions out of nowhere)

I feel like it might be an issue of overuse. I'm going to do a 4 day rest now and hoping it will calm down, but I'd love to hear some tips what I could do actively against this issue

I never had problems with overuse prior to my 4 week break, even when doing 14 days no rest in Bleau haha, so I hope it might be just some reconditions that I'm missing 

TL;DR: developed overuse problems with fingers, need advice how to avoid

Looking forward to your thoughts! I'd love to get back to full capacity for spring
Digestion deserves more attention Everybody talks about training and nutrition, but not that many people seem to talk about digestion. But these things go hand in hand, so talking about one without the other is pointless.

I feel like there's plenty of information out there on training and nutrition, so in this post I will share what I've learned about digestion as it relates to climbing. An estimated 1 in 4 people have IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), and an estimated 80% of these cases are caused by sibo (small intestines bacterial overgrowth). 

&amp;#x200B;

**My experience:**

In 2022, I tried to go from having climbed a max grade of a 7a to having climbed an 8a in a single year. This was my response to having received the news that I have a (progressive) hip impairment, and this whole challenge was a way for me to try and overcome the impairment. I've tried to keep track of my progress on YouTube and on my blog in case others were interested (newest video is a work in progress by the way, with hundreds of hours of footage, this one will take a while...).

It was a very stressful year: On Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays I would work during the day then train in the evening, on Thursdays I would work during the day, then drive to the crag (4.5 hours away) in the evening, then Friday to Sunday I would climb at the crag and sleep in the camper van. Then drive back on Sunday, do all the necessary washing and cleaning, and then repeat it all the next week. It was a grind, but also an amazing experience! In fact, it was a transformative experience.

But more importantly for the topic of digestion: it was stressful!

I started 2022 by focussing on my fear of falling, but that continued to be a big theme the rest of the year. So in essence, I spent a large chunk of the time being stressed in 2022. Stressed due to the fear of falling, or stressed because of excitement to climb, or psych for being at the crag in general. And the rest of the week I would work or train. As a result, my body didn't have the necessary time to recover. Important note, I'm not saying the training load was the problem: the lack of rest (periods of time with little to no stress) was the problem. 

As a result, towards the end of the year my digestion was seriously compromised, and this led to numerous deficiencies (such as vitamin D and B12) and even injuries... Keep in mind, nutrition wasn't the problem. In fact, nutritionally, there was no reason to think I would get a deficiency. But unfortunately, my body was unable to take in the nutrients, which eventually resulted in injuries.

&amp;#x200B;

**Digestion basics:**

Here are some basics on digestion. Keep in mind, this is heavily simplified. But I think it's a good enough to serve as a basis for some pointers.

Digestion starts in the mouth, through chewing, saliva and some enzymes. Food moves down to the stomach, where stomach acid and enzymes help break down food. Due to the acid, there are very few bacteria in the stomach. After this, the small intestines absorb most of the nutrients using digestive juices, and a small number of bacteria. The large intestines finish the job of breaking down the remaining nutrients by using a large amount of bacteria.

Food moves through the GI tract using peristalsis. A process called migrating motor complex (MMC) is used to clean the bowels. This happens 2 to 4 hours after your last meal. By pushing remaining food down, through the valves that separate the different parts of the GI tract, bacteria from the large intestines won't be able to move to the small intestines.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rest and digest**

Understanding the difference between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems is vital. The sympathetic nervous system involves action; this is what gives you the energy to climb hard. The parasympathetic nervous system involves long term processes that happen during rest, most notably digestion and recovery.

The sympathetic nervous system controls everything related to stress. It's good to remember that a lot of fun activities, like sending a project or even being psyched to see a friend try hard, are sympathetic in nature. In other words, stressful. Stress is often related to negative events... but for the body, even positive experiences can be stressful, in the sense that the "here and now" is prioritized over processes that are necessary for long term health.

So in practice, there needs to be a balance. We need the enjoyment, the psych, the high energy that the sympathetic nervous system gives us. But we also need to digest our food, and recover from training. Having a very stressful life (whether through work, training, anxiety or otherwise) means your digestion will suffer. In the short term, this doesn't need to be a problem. But a structural lack of rest (low stress) means your digestion will often be paused, which can lead to disbalance. For instance, if food is often stuck in the small intestines, and isn't being pushed down due to all kinds of stressful events, then the bacteria in the small intestines will start to grow. This could lead to sibo, where bacteria in the small intestines will ferment the food, meaning your body won't be able to take in certain nutrients. This can lead to deficiencies, and eventually injuries.

&amp;#x200B;

**Basic tips**

Understanding the basics of digestion can help formulate some guidelines:

* Chew your food
* Space 2 hours of time between a meal and a climbing session. This period of time needs to involve little to no stress.
* Taking a snack just before or during a climbing session is still possible, if the snack doesn't need much in terms of digestion (for instance, if you take glucose rather than carbohydrates, then you're not eating something that can linger in the bowels and lead to excessive fermentation)
* Give your body a chance to clean the pipes (MMC): 4 hours of rest (little to no stress, and no exercise) every day where you're not eating. 
* If you don't have a satisfying daily poo, or if you have a (vitamin) deficiency, it's worth looking into a combination of your eating habits, daily rest vs stressful periods, and digestion.
* If you have food intolerances, it's worth to look into sibo.

&amp;#x200B;

In my case, my gut microbiome was out of balance due to a very long, stressful period. The immediate symptoms were bloating and belching, as hydrogen was formed in the small intestines. Very annoying! It eventually also lead to some deficiencies and even injuries. I'm happy to report I've since found some local experts that have helped me understand the problem and work on a solution. As a result, I'm finding balance again.... which in turns means fewer injuries and more gains :)

This is a personal story, but something tells me it can help others as well. Digestion just isn't talked about as much as other topics, despite being vital. So I hope this helps!
Breaking V5/V6 plateau (bouldering) Hey guys, I know this comes up a lot but it's quite a personalised question.

Stats: 74kg, 5' 11". 140% 20mm max hang. 6 years of bouldering.

Injuries: I've suffered a lot of pulley injuries. In 2020 lockdown I did max hangs up to 150% BW and subsequently injured myself the third time in the gym. Ever since, I've had pulley injuries here and there effectively resetting my progress. My most recent was in November (2 pulleys at once) and I had to build up from V3 since then. This time around I'm highly focused on not getting injured.

Training: I boulder every other day. Once a week I'll do max hangs. Over the last two months, my bouldering sessions focused on building a pyramid - I did all the V3-V4 and most of the V5s in the centre. Since the last two weeks, I've switched strategies to purely bouldering routes that I don't know are possible for me; mostly V6 or hard V5s. 

I can comfortably do easy V5s in 3-10 tries but a harder V5 might take a few sessions (20+ attempts). V6 on the other hand I rarely send. Of the three V6s I'm currently attempting I can do all  the moves except the crux. Doing the crux and then linking the moves seems unlikely before the reset. I've probably already put 30+ attempts into each of them. 

I'm not entirely sure my current strategy is the best way to go about this. I feel strong in terms of crimp strength - I don't think this is limiting me. In the last few weeks I've focused on identifying my weaknesses and I've noticed that:

* V6s at my gym frequently involve heel and toe hooks. These are fine if the holds are nice, but often at this level I find that my heel/toe hooks are slipping as the holds are pretty crap. In fact this is limiting me from completing my current V6 projects.

* Another aspect, particularly on steep climbing, is that due to the unforgiving hold placement/types of holds, I can't use my feet effectively. This is a combination of lack of core strength, not engaging my feet properly, and poor footwork in general. This problem also presents itself in slabs - V5 slab is often difficult for me. Toe swaps are also very difficult for me.

* Similarly, vertical climbing at this level typically involves really crap feet. I'm certain that I'm not weighting my feet effectively as they often slip off.

It seems to me my issues are mostly technique based although in the case of heel/toe hooks I can't work out if this is technique or strength (or both). I definitely feel like I need to build core strength off the wall too.

What would you guys recommend as a path forward? I'm not certain that focusing on a few projects is time efficient. I seem to be making incremental progress on the crux moves but that's the problem - I'm getting better at a highly problem-specific movement and maybe not better overall. 

I'm wondering if it's better to continue focusing on my pyramid instead, or maybe it's time to start moonboarding one session a week. Maybe some off-the-wall training? I'm not clued up on training strategies at all, and it seems my genetics aren't suited for a "just climb" approach.

I appreciate any advice - thanks in advance.
Shoulder instability, lack of activation and stability in scalpula, impingement feeling. My entire left side feels wrong.. I’ve been dealing with this for years… Ive tried 100s stretches and strengthening routines. No improvement at all. PT says c7 nerve, waiting on MRI. Anyone have a clue.
Tension board 2.0 vs Tension board 1 for training? Does anyone out there have experience TRAINING on both boards? Which is better? Strengths vs weaknesses of each board? What are the climbing style differences you’ve noticed between boards? Does one do better with training technical problems? I own the TB1 and I love it as my primary trading tool, but I’m interested in upgrading to the full TB2 someday if it’s better at certain things. I’m particularly interested in the ability to climb / set realistic problems simulating hard sport climbing, favoring small holds, awkward positions, footwork and crimps. The larger board format and variety of holds on the TB2 appeals to me, but I’m not sure it’s better at those things. I’m looking for opinions and training experience. Whichever one I own will be my primary training tool b/c I have no access to a gym. I live in the middle of nowhere, so I have no realistic way of testing the TB2. I could maybe take a road trip - but 1 day of experience is no substitute for Reddit reviews. Lay it on me.
Technique day question This might be a bit of a specific question but I feel like this question is nerdy enough for you guys. Over the past few months I started structuring my sessions a little more from my previous “project three days a week and try hard” plan. I do a limit session, and fun/projecting session, and a technique session. For the technique session I’ve been doing perfect repeats with three goes at flash level climbs. I generally shoot for 8 climbs so if I send everything I climb 24 problems. This was heavily inspired by u/eshlow’s 7 year retrospective post. It’s generally been good for recovery since I’m not trying as hard and I feel like by my third attempt at each problem I have pretty solid beta and am climbing pretty efficiently. The only issue is I find this approach is pretty boring because of the repetitions. There have been a few days when friends are at the gym and I only do half the plan and switch to light projecting. I guess my question here is if it’s worth doing the repetitions or if I could switch to doing 24 different problems with no repeats if I send. On one hand I feel that I really do see an improvement on the third repeat compared to the first attempt, but on the other hand I think I have a tendency to focus on one beta which may not be the most efficient. If I do all different problems I’d get a wider movement variety in and hopefully will enjoy the session more too. But I’m willing to do the repeats if people here have had more success with those even if it’s more boring, most weeks I’ve been pretty good at sticking with the plan. I could also just be overthinking this and any climbing at flash level with a focus on technique will probably have a positive impact.

For some background I’ve been climbing for about 2.5 years with a focus on problems resembling those you’d find outdoors. When it’s warm I trad climb with a newer friend I’ve made (mostly following). Currently I’m at a plateau (I think) been stuck on V5 for over a year but I am sending more of them with less effort. I want to be a well rounded climber but I definitely do some grade chasing as well.
Strategies for more energy on climbing days? Every week or so I drive 2 - 2 1/2 hours from Atlanta to go bouldering in Chattanooga. Often the drive, carrying pads and finding the boulder tires me. Then I climb for 3-5 hours and I’m powered out. Which is pretty good in my eyes. Though I see Eric Jerome and Tristan Chen doing monstrous factorial challenges, there’s people participating in a 24 hour route climbing challenge in HCR, heck I just want to be able to last a triple crown competition. 

I want to get a most I can out of these climbing days so I’m here crowd sourcing ideas on how to prepare for and execute long climbing days. Maybe there are some mistakes I should be wary of?

I’ll begin with describing what I currently do to prepare for a big day. The days prior drink plenty of water and hope I can get good nights of rest. The day before have a full rest day and eat a bit more than usual. Plan which climbs I’ll want to check out.

During the big day I eat some food when I get hungry. I avoid doing send attempts every time and I avoid ripping attempts one after another.  

To me the glaring problem is that my sleep is very inconsistent but that seems like an impossible challenge to fix. Perhaps I should eat more on the climbing days, not relying on hunger cues. Maybe continue doing more long climbing days and my body will adapt.

Let me know what you all think about this topic.
Shoulders &amp;#x200B;

I've been doing weight training for maybe a month, and seek advice on scheduling, sets and intensity. I'm 70 and in pretty good shape. I've been doing what I believe is somewhat haphazard training that favors endurance over fast-twitch strength. I set the weights for 25 reps, which gets me to the point where I'm getting tired, but I could probably push it for another 5. I'm reluctant to max out because a few years back I had bilateral rotator cuff surgery. I also had a pretty serious bout of tendonitis in my '20s from too much wind surfing in heavy air, pre-harness days.  I've just been doing a single set per day.  I haven't been very consistent with scheduling. Averaging 3 or 4 times a week, but sometimes gaps of 3 or 4 days, sometimes back to back days. 

My goal is to add both more endurance and burst strength. Mostly the former, because realistically I'm never going to be crawling across roofs. I'd like to get to the point where I don't get completely gassed doing moderate multi-pitches. 

If I want to just favor endurance, I'm  thinking I need to add more sets, maybe even reducing the weight. I'm thinking I need to start doing overhead presses to keep my shoulder joint development balanced. Based on shoulder history, this is probably the safest plan, at least until I build up solid musculature supporting the joint. 

If I want to introduce more strength training, I should probably stop doing pulldowns on sequential days. It hasn't been a problem so far, but from what I understand it takes a day to recover from more strenuous exercise than what I'm doing now, and to make any significant gains in strength I need to add sets, maybe "ladder" them the way I'm doing hang boarding, with 3, then 5, then 9 reps with the adjustment of weight to exhaustion at 12. 

Am I on the right track here?
Targeting weakness in hand/foot matching on the Moonboard I have mostly climbed on the Moonboard for the last year. At first for training purposes, but poor conditions and lack of motivated partners have made board climbing kind of my main focus.

I have done a reasonable amount of benchmarks on the 2016 board (188 in total) plus a few on the 2019 and have seen steady gains. 

My current benchmark pyramid is something like:

73x6B+
50x6C
31x6C+
21x7A
12x7A+ (one flash)

(1x7B+ if Go Big Sim counts, I don’t think it should)

One specific type of move I always struggle is to generate momentum from high feet or hand-foot matches. Some problems I’ve struggled with for a long time are Tess (last move), Snapback (last move), Bill Clintons Sax Var, The Crane Direct (last move) and various others.

I usually have no problem bringing my feet up high and hold the position, but once the foot is on I can’t seem to generate the momentum needed to let go with one hand and catch the next hold. I feel like my ass sags out from the board and causes my fingers to pull away from the holds instead of pulling down. 

I’ll try to get some video from these problems, but I don’t think I have any at the moment. Is this likely to be the lack of proper technique, lack of flexibility/mobility or lack of some specific strength in core or fingers?
William Bosi and Lattice posted this cool method for replica training on Insta. Interesting idea for people with homewalls, or cool gyms.
I hated this chart I've been doing hangboarding for a few months now,  the risk of pulley injuries and their prevention well worth the time I've been devoting to it. Then I saw this:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ0FThjCL6o&amp;ab\_channel=EmilAbrahamsson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ0FThjCL6o&amp;ab_channel=EmilAbrahamsson)

If I'm interpreting this right, it takes forever for tendons and ligaments to adapt. Hangboarding works well to develop muscle for the fingers relatively quickly, but with all that other stuff in there, I'm not feeling inclined to push too hard crimping on the wall. I was eyeing the campus board, and I'm now thinking maybe not for a while. I just started working on dynos. Perhaps I should take it easy there as well. 

The chart is not age-specific, so if anything, I need to take the timeline conservatively. The last thing I want to happen is to hear or feel a pop in my hand. 

I'm okay with that. My attitude about any outdoor activity has never been driven by impatience. If I increase my chances of staying healthy, I'll adjust my expectations. And  enjoy the slower pace.
Density hangs: what they are useful for and not useful for Ever since c4hp and Emil and others have talked about density hangs, I've been seeing a ton of people recommending them for injury prevention when they don't understand what they do over the past few months.

First off, density hangs are longer duration hangs such as 30s or greater used to decrease collagen stiffness. The reason for this is a longer duration hang will slowly stretch the tendon microscopically which reduces the amount of cross-bridging between collagen fibers. This makes it more pliable and less stiff. For instance, when performing a deadpoint move it can reduce peak force on the tendon as a more pliable tendon takes longer to become taut when the muscles contract.

**edit**: the above is what the people were claiming happens. When a couple of us started digging into studies [it might not be as claimed (?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/11m0jhd/density_hangs_what_they_are_useful_for_and_not/jbnnp99/?context=10000). At least more study is warranted.

Simple right?

However, it seems a lot of people are misinterpreting this data as an "all cause" reduction in injury. Let's look at some examples of various training programs where using density hangs may not cause injury reduction or where density hangs are not useful at all.

* If someone is doing explosive moves like deadpoints or big movements in their training, the density hangs aren't going to increase tendon pliability because the explosive movements increase cross-bridging of the collagen fibers. This is basically doing things that are contradictory in nature for training so there's really no point.

* Also, increases in collagen stiffness is REQUIRED to maximize strength and power. You want stiff tendons in order to maximize force output like plyometrics with sprinters, so it's not a bad thing depend on what your training goal is. If you're in a performance phase where you're aiming to get the most out of your climbing outdoors then you want your tendons to be stiff to maximize your performance. 

* Additionally, cumulative stress via frequency, intensity, and volume is mainly what matters in injury reduction risk. If someone adds density hangs on top of already too much climbing and wall work it would only exacerbate overuse injuries. 

* Density hangs are useful mainly in respect to a climbing program that is likely going to be low to moderate intensity and you're not pushing a performance phase. For instance, they can be used for rehab or coming off rehab as you're starting to ramp up the intensity and volume again. Like I discussed in the previous point, you don't want to use them if you're in a performance phase because you're basically reducing your ability to perform at the highest level.

In reality, any use of the fingers via climbing, hangboard, or whatever else type of finger work are going to stimulate tendon and ligament adaptations. Force is force. Density hangs can only potentially reduce injury in conjunction with a program with the right amount of frequency, intensity and volume, and when you're not in performance phase where you're aiming to maximize your strength and power output make sure you're at peak condition to send climbs. For instance, off-season type training where you may want to stay injury free and work on adding muscle and focusing on improving technique. 

Summary:

If you're going to use density hangs then use them correctly. You can't just throw them into a program and think they reduce injury. In fact, they can actually hurt performance or contribute to injury in some cases if you're already doing too much.
Transitioning from comp kid to outdoor sport climbing, trying to set some realistic goals I’ve been climbing for about 7-8 years, mostly as a team kid focusing on comps. I’m graduating this semester, and I think I want to focus on sending some hard sport climbs over the next couple of years.



I’m trying to figure out a realistic progression  for this. I can send boulders inside in the V9-10 range usually in a dedicated session or two. I haven’t climbed outside very much, but I’ve done V9 in a couple sessions and got really close on some 10s and in-style 11 in a session. My finger strength and upper body strength is pretty high for my send grades. The past 6months I’ve been doing lots of sport climbing and endurance in the gym, I’m usually able to send 12s in a few try’s and I’m close-ish on 13a.



I have a sport trip to the red coming up; this will be the second time I’ve ever sport climbed outside. The first trip I just did a bunch of 10s and 11s. I’m not sure what a realistic goal for this trip is. I’m thinking of trying to do a low .12 in 1-3 attempts, and I want to attempt a .13a even if it’s unlikely to send.



I’m mainly looking towards next year around this time. I have no idea what a realistic goal to train for once I graduate is. After a short power endurance phase I can do 4x4s on V7s, but I feel really far from doing that on a route. There’s a 45ft 14a at the red I had the idea of working towards next spring, but is even attempting 13d/14a a reasonable goal a year from where I’m at? Anyone who’s moved from indoor bouldering to outdoor sport, any advice or ideas for reasonable goals? I feel like I need something concrete to shoot for to really train my best. Once I’m done with comps, I’m not really sure whats realistic to aim for.
How important is learning how to read climbs? I almost always climb with someone else and often climb with people stronger than me. Because of that, I’ve grown to become a huge beta-stealer. Of course climbing is about having fun and I have a ton of fun just trying to do hard movements, but when I do try things by myself, it comes out pretty clear that I’m not the best at figuring stuff out.  
  
For context I climbed around 10 V8s (never tried anything harder) and flash probably more than half of V6s. But when I’m alone it can take many attempts to figure out some V4s. Often times I’ll also just brute force my way through those with a way harder beta until I realize what it’s supposed to be.  
  
I’m not the worst at reading problems and I was punching down a bit in the above paragraph, but it’s a clear weakness. How important is it though? Of course for competitions it’s vital and for rope climbing too, but is it a huge mistake to always be taking bets from other people? Or is it still good to learn that way and get more comfortable with new styles?
How are people feeling about Tyler Nelsons Analysis of Max Hangs being less useful than we give credit for in climbing? https://www.climbing.com/skills/fingerboard-training-is-for-novice-climbers-part-1/

https://www.climbing.com/skills/fingerboard-training-part-ii/

Some interesting ideas from these articles (free if you just sign up with a new email for another free account). 

Some of the athletes on his instagram (c4hp) are pulling some pretty impressive results on the load cell. 

He also claims to be able to one arm hang a 10mm edge without a focus on max hangs. 

I’ve found it pretty interesting and have been convinced to at least allot a single block of strength training (4-6 weeks) to his method to see how it feels.
When to schedule the hang board routine? Hello r/climbharder,

I just started with a hangboard routine on top of two times a week bouldering and two times a week strength training (gym).

**About myself:**

* 33 years old
* 173 cm / 5’8
* 68 kg / 150 pound
* 5 years of bouldering (some climbing)

**My hangboard routine**

* 6 sets of max hangs 
* 20mm edge + 15kg
* about 10 seconds per set

&amp;#x200B;

I like the routine a lot and prefer it over repeaters. I would like to continue doing this routine for two times a week. However I am not sure when to do it so that I get enough recovery. I can feel some progress at my bouldering since I started the hang board routine. 

My boulder- and gym schedule is more or less fixed due to bouldering and gym partners. I love both my bouldering and gym sessions and do not want to shorten or skip any of those sessions.

However as mentioned above I am not sure if I can even put two hang board sessions in my weekly schedule without over training. 

&amp;#x200B;

As of now my schedule looks as follows:

**Monday**

Lunchtime: 6 sets of max hang (20 mins - 90% intensity)

Evening : Gym strength training mainly chest and shoulders, arms (1 hour - 90% intensity)

**Tuesday**

Rest day

**Wednesday**

Evening: Bouldering (2 hours - 100% intensity)

 **Thursday**

Rest Day

**Friday**

Lunchtime: 6 sets of max hang (20 mins - 90% intensity)

Evening : Gym strength training upper and lower back, arms and legs (1 hour - 90% intensity)

**Saturday**

Rest day

**Sunday**

Lunchtime: Bouldering (3 hours - 100% intensity)

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have an suggestions on how to improve my schedule? Is the timing of the hand board sessions okay? 

Thanks a lot for any help or suggestions.

Much love &lt;3
Sorry for posting again. Due to popular demand, here are the normalized heatmaps for every 40 degree Moonboard-Setup for every grade in a Benchmarks-Only and All-Problems version. Numbers stand for percantage of problems this hold is used in.
Is it bad to burn yourself out at the end of a session? There seems to be a lot of hate for end-of-session burnout climbing on climbing subs and I want to know the reason behind this.

Many people seem to favor training fresh so that they can climb harder and send more, but is this leading to more improvement? I used to run a lot and most coaches opted to increase mileage until we were close to burnout and then decrease mileage for end-of-season racing. Time and time again this worked wonders for our team. So my question is, should climbers follow a similar routine if they want to see max improvement?

I climb every other day and recently took 4 days off and came back projecting 2 V grades higher than usual. Am I exhausting myself, or is this strategic? I fear that I wouldn’t see the same results without training as hard as I do.

I currently limit bouldering one session, rest a day, sport climb the next session with 30 minutes ARC at the end, rest a day, then repeat. I also do abs + stretch daily and a hip mobility workout on off days.

I was considering adding a 4x4 at the end of my limit sessions but I want to know if that would be advantageous.

If limit bouldering is power lifting, and sport climbing/ARC/4x4 is running, a healthy balance of both seems like the best idea, right?

What do you think, how much is too much, and what does “too much” look like?
This one simple trick made me go up 4 bouldering grades in one season. This post is gonna sound stupid, because it pretty much is. This past fall, I got my first V7. This past week, I got my first V10. I haven't tried some new training plan, I haven't started dieting, I haven't even been climbing more than I usually do. I have only changed one thing about my climbing that has caused me to go up 4 grades in a season.


The one simple trick is PROJECTING! This season I have committed to projecting boulders more than I ever have before and it has paid off beyond belief for me. I used to be a climber that would spend one session at a boulder and never go back to the boulder, even if I made decent progress in a session. I think I had this weird anxiety about not doing well or sending it when I went back even if I liked the boulder. This past season I committed to going to a boulder for more than one session because I knew I was strong enough to get a V7. I got it the second session. I did the same thing with V8, V9, and V10. I know this post will probably not apply to most people because honestly most people are smart enough to just frickin go back and project for another session or two, but it helped me more than I could believe. Projecting and committing more time has improved not only the grades I have sent but also my enjoyment of bouldering overall, as it has decreased pressure on myself, and my overall skill and technique in my opinion.


Hopefully this helps someone else out there to get out there and project!
Since my last post here got so many comments from people struggling with similar issues or wanting to see my progress, I figured I’d post an update. This is from 19 days of a 1 hour a day homemade physio routine. Most progress I’ve made in years. In a few months I expect to be 100% recovered.
Training guidelines for beginner I've been climbing for almost two years now. I've sent few 6c (5.11a/b) and started working on 6c+ and 7a routes.  I'm 180cm (5'11) and I weight around 77kg (170lbs) and I feel like I'm really weak physically. I'm able to pull up 4-5 times, and have problems to hang bodyweighy on Beastmaker 20mm edge (managed to do it with -10kg). When compared with friends of similar (or lower) grades, all of them have better strength benchmarks. Not only pull ups and hangs, but also push ups, one leg sits etc.

I feel like I relied heavily on "just climb" approach (3-4 times a week) with some structured training for power-endurance and random pull up and hangboard hanging in between, but I feel like that's not enough.More and more I'm shut down by fingery or powery crux on a route and I'm just not able to pull harder.

How would you structure training for such person? Right now, the weather is getting better, so my focus will shift mainly to outside lead climbing, but I can easily swap indoor climbing sessions for gym if that's what gonna help me climb stronger.  


EDIT:  
Another question would be: should I even be hangboarding if I can't hang 20mm BW? Nut if now how to progress so I eventually can?
Critique my new training plan? I've been hardstuck at V4-V5 for a few years now? Main goal is to improve climbing but would also like to maintain a good lifting physique with antagonist training Here is the full schedule by week and by day. Does it cover everything? Is it well-balanced? Am I doing too much? Any other advice?

I should also mention I only really care about indoor climbing right now. Eventually I'd like to enter bouldering competitions but have no plans of climbing outside at this time.

Struggling with motivation Hello, 

I'll jump right into it. 

I've been climbing on and off for a long time. I'm 22 now, but I first started climbing in my middle-ish teens. Grinded up to one v6(+), then quit. I picked climbing back up in college, sent my first ever v7 which I was super happy with but then unfortunately the pandmic forced me to stop because my gym closed (and at the time I was not familiar with outdoor stuff, and didn't know any home wall owners). About a year and a half ago I picked it up again and I've been climbing ever since. I've done 3 or 4 v9s   
(but soft), but now I am struggling with motivation. I will try to distill my feeling in the following bits. 

First, I get the sense that I am sort of reaching my limit here. Not only do I feel as though I have been climbing for quite a bit now in total, and all the while I have watched my progress slow to a painful crawl. But also, to me, my training is absolutely dialed. I know how to train, I know how to program, and I work very hard (I can offer details in the comments if asked). This makes me think that there is not much I can do to change the pace at which I am improving. The slow progress makes it hard for me to motivate because it feels as though so many goals are out of my reach. v12? pretty sure that'll actually be impossible. OAP? maybe a dumb goal but I've always wanted to do one; however, the longer I train the more it seems like it won't happen for me. 

Second, I am so so so tired of watching my weight. I am not a person who stays lean easily. Over the last year and a half I lost about 60lbs, and since then I have regained about 20-30lbs of that. I went from loving food, and not being overly interested in how my body looked, to a bad eating disorder in the snap of a finger. Now I hate eating, and no matter what I do I can't seem to figure out a good balance. It feels like I've tried everything and this really contributes to my lack of motivation.

Third, I don't know how to set goals for myself. I don't know what is realistic. I'm not a super genetic outlier (and also I didn't start early enough) so I know that I won't be competing or toping v17 in my life. So what should I aim for? Maybe kind of a lame take but: I estimate that it would take me 2-3 more years of super dialed training to climb a 'real' (as in not soft) v10 indoors. But v10 indoors is not at all impressive relative to the amount of hard work that I have dedicated to the sport. (side note here I really don't want to diminish anyone's accomplishments, I want to emphasize that the only reason it would not be impressive is because I take climbing so seriously, and I have the luxury that I can give a lot of time for it). I don't know how to set goals so I don't ever feel the joy of working hard to improve. I don't know how to mainitain my motivation when every single week I send all the new v7s, then I send some of the v8s, and then every once and a while I get a v9. I reached v6 in 1 month on my third time coming back to climbing. I had so much muscle memory, plus I was losing weight so I was lighter than I had ever been. I got to v7 pretty quick after and I have been stuck there ever since.

I think these are my three main points. I will conclude by saying that I would really appreciate anyone who interacts with this post. I am the kind of person who digs themselves into a rut and then it becomes impossible for me to get myself out of it and that's the situation I am in now. I really need help to get out of this. I don't know if I should just stop climbing? Or if there is a way for me to mend my approach to be more sustainable and enjoyable? 

Thank you in advance, 

Hector

TLDR: I am burnt out, I have no motivation, and I don't know whether or not I should continue climbing.
How to generate power through high feet as a taller climber I’m a taller climber (6’2”) of my weaknesses is hand/foot matches and driving through my feet in high positions on boards (especially moon board). My flexibility and power is OK but could be better and I feel it is more of a limiting factor given my height. I have naturally pretty muscular legs for a climber, and find one leg squats fairly easy without any doing training.

I’ve been doing a lot of hip stretches recently and came up with my own exercise where you start in a deep squat/horse stance and then try and explode up to the ceiling as high as I can as quickly as possible. I do some starting with weighting myself on my left/right leg and in the middle.

It’s a a bit too early to know how much this will help my climbing but I was wondering if anyone else has tried the same or similar exercise and whether it has helped with high feet? Or any other tips that helped improved the movement? Also I’d be interested in hearing from taller climbers as to whether they still find this movement much harder than most or whether they ‘unlocked it’ to some degree.
For reference I climb V8 kilter (which I get on regularly) and V5 moonboard last time I tried (but haven’t climbed on it while).
Using rest periods in between max hangs I usually try to keep my workouts as short as possible, so I usually try to make the most of the rest periods by training something else during my rests. For example if I'm doing weighted pullups, I might do some pushing exercise in between sets to not waste that time. I know it's not ideal for max strength training, but I feel like I can mostly get away with it as long as the exercises are unrelated, and I have a bit extra rest before the exercise I prioritize.   
With max hangs though, it's harder to judge if I'm fresh to go again though, so I don't know if I'm compromising my strength gains by doing so. Today for example, I was doing deadlifts between my max hangs, and started wondering if I was just wasting my time. Do you know of any evidence that this is counterproductive, know of any experts who claim so or have any experience with this ?   


Doing nothing is not really an option for me during that time. I guess I could work on my mobility, but I prefer using the weights since I'm already at the gym, whereas I can train mobility any time. 

I have to say though, as I supposed everyone will say is obvious, that I am not making great finger strength progress. I probably never have respected it enough, i.e. often worked on it towards the end of my sessions and interspersed with other exercises. My max hang has barely increased from roughly +30% to +40% in 1.5/2 years, whereas my climbing has gone from ?V5/6ish to V9.   


Let me know your thoughts and how you go about this! 

And if you have any tips about finger strength. On the wall, I don't feel like my fingers are weak - I do best on crimpy boulders, but I know many weaker climbers who can hang more, so it's hard to assess how big of a problem it is. But seeing a V3 climber able to hang the same weight as me, or another climber around my level hang 10s on one arm on a hold much smaller than I can hold on to, it worries me a bit.)
Incorporating strength training as a fairly "weak" climber Hi! I’d love some advice on how to best incorporate strength training for a climber that is pretty physically weak for the grade (or if I should just forget it and go back to “just climbing”). The general consensus of myself and friends who climb harder is that while I have decent finger strength and technique (tho always room for improvement!), my biggest limiting weakness by far is just raw pulling power. My issue is that any time I start to incorporate much off the wall strength training I feel super fatigued in a way that feels very limiting/overtrained pretty quickly. 

Background: 30F, learned to climb awhile ago, but really started getting into bouldering &amp; trying hard a couple years back. At the moment climbing around v6-7 range inside/outside, would love to break into the 7-8 range more this year and generally get more well rounded. I started off not being able to do a single pull-up, can do a few now, but doing more than around 5-6 is a struggle. I especially struggle with pulling through in open positions where the hold is not in line with my body. I’ve never really hang boarded since finger strength has never felt limiting.

My current schedule is not too strict, but generally follows: 

\- 3 days a week of climbing for 2-3 hrs at the gym (replacing 1 to 2 days w/ outside days as the weather allows). I try to do a mix of volume and projecting, will usually board climb one of those days if they’ve all been at the gym.

\- 1 day a week of lifting, sometimes combined w/ a gym day but depends on my schedule. Focus is injury prevention, PT/rehab, and general strengthening, will do a mix of dead lifts, sl split squats, bench, ohp, various core stability things, etc.

\- Biking/running etc “cross training” as my body feels good and the weather is nice, v optional

I’ve tried just adding in some campusing/weighted pull-ups/wide grip/archer pull ups after climbing/ to the gym day (usually 3 sets of something I can hit but barely by the end), but within about two weeks of consistent work I always end up feeling just dead tired, unable to perform on the climbing days, and regressing in the strength training as well. Any sort of training plans I’ve found on the internet tend to focus on incorporating hang boarding (not my weakness, very different type of stress imo) so I’ve been a little lost as to how to incorporate more muscle/cns tiring training sustainably.

Is this the sort of scenario where I need to be periodizing training more over the course of the year? Ignoring that plateau feeling and just keep trying to get stronger through climbing alone? Doing easier “power” workouts that are more sustainable long-term? I do feel like I’m still improving via my “mostly just climb” approach, so I’m a little hesitant to take away from the climbing time, but would be nice to improve in more than one aspect at once.

Thank you so much in advance for your thoughts, hopefully this is at least a different sort of problem than the training plan for the v4-6 strong boy plateau :)
Understanding the translation of finger strength to grades + outliers (weak fingers, but high grades) &amp;#x200B;

[I recently came across this crazy feat of finger strength from this no name climber (2:38 for footage)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNkGQCBtw6A&amp;ab_channel=EricKarlssonBouldering)

In that video, the climber named Mickey proceeds to hang for solid 2 seconds with 50% BW ONE ARMED on a \~20mm edge.

AFAIK(as far as I know), that level of finger strength is around V15/V16. However, Mickey is nowhere near a V15/V16 level.

Now, I am aware that finger strength increases as grades go up (i.e. a group of random outdoor V4 climbers will *NEVER* have a greater average finger strength than a group of random outdoor V9 climbers), but what I fail to logically comprehend are the outliers.

I fail to see how someone who cannot even one arm hang on a 20mm edge could EVER send a crimpy V13 (I read a post a while back of someone doing V12/13 while not even being able to one arm hang on 20mm edge), I fail to see how one of my friends with  much worse finger strength can make a very **"hangboardy"** move (perfectly horizontal crimp you pull on) look as easy as I make it look, and more.

Now, when it comes to people with much weaker fingers sending harder problems, the only two explanations I could come up with are better technique and better power endurance/recovery in between the moves.

But when it comes to a singular move that is very 'hangboard-like' (explained above), I just cannot understand how people with weaker finger strength can make it look as easy as those with much superior finger strength.

Any answers to help me understand the outliers would be appreciated.
I’ve been needing to deload after 2-3 weeks for the past few months. Is this normal or am I training wrong? I climb 3 days a week in the gym. Climbed for a couple years once a week in college and started climbing seriously last year.  
  
My sessions are around 2-3 hours typically including warm up and cool down. Rest between attempts I think I need to be better at, but I do try to take care of myself. I also use easy days and focused slab/sloper days to give my fingers more of a chance to recover when it’s needed.  
  
I moonboard around 30-45 minutes a week, but no hangboarding or finger training otherwise. I use spray wall around once a week as well, but that is in the 2-3 hour session.  
  
The last few months, Ive been needing to deload every 2-3 weeks. Before that it was usually 4-6 weeks on and then 1 week deload. Sleep has been good and eating the same as before. I’m climbing harder and have gotten a new flash grade and day flashing higher grades as well.  
  
My sign for deload is usually feeling like the 2 day rest at the end of the week isn’t enough. Fingers still feel tired, body feels weaker, etc. I always have come back strong so from a performance point of view it has been great. Just a bit interesting that I felt I needed to deload so much more often recently.  
  
Is this just my body needing to rest more to catch up to harder climbing? Or a sign that I should dial back a bit?
How to start training without losing the love for the sport Hi all,

I'm looking for advice on getting a bit more serious with my climbing. I'm researching and reading and hearing lots of mixed stuff about how to start training and getting stronger, would love some advice on where to start! A lot of the resources I'm reading are basically implying I should stop climbing and just train, however I want to maintain the regular fun sessions where you just have fun and enjoy yourself!

Background: 24F, started bouldering 3/4 years ago but have had quite a few breaks from 3 - 6 months due to injuries and life! Max outdoor grade is 7b boulder and 7a+ sport which I got last summer, since then I took a 6 month break (due to life!) and started easing myself back in in February. Currently I'm 5'7, 60kg, can crank out about 8 pull ups on a good day. I did a max finger strength in the summer and it was about 160%. I haven't ever trained I've always relied on getting stronger through 'just climbing' with an occasional ab workout snuck in! I work two jobs in London (damn expensive city,) so can only commit to 3 sessions a week!

I ideally want to build my power endurance as well as just general strength, with the goal of sending a couple more 7's over the course of the year. Not looking for someone to write me a training plan, but just any resources that you found useful when you started  training!

Cheers folks for any tips
Sport climbers - do you train in a rope climbing gym, a bouldering gym, or both? Hi all, I’m trying to decide whether to invest my time and $ into a gym with rope climbing access or stick with a bouldering gym.

A little about me - I’ve been climbing for 5 years. The first 3.5 years were exclusively indoor rope climbing. Then for 9 months I was training in a rope gym, but also got hooked on outdoor sport climbing. For the past 9 months I’ve still been sport climbing outside but I’ve been training in a bouldering gym (mix of kilterboard and set boulders). I’ve sent 2 12.a’s/7a+, 6 7a’s/11.d (including 2 onsights). I have only bouldered outside twice but on the kilterboard I’ve sent a good handful of v6/7A. 

This summer I’ll be moving to Denver, and I’m trying to decide what I’ll do gym-wise. Prior to focusing on training-by-bouldering this past year, I knew max strength was my biggest roadblock, but I feel I’ve made big strides in overcoming that. Conversely, endurance always felt like a strength previously and I feel that starting to slip away. I know I can do endurance training on boulders, but I feel like it doesn’t translate quite as well. 

My question is, for other climbers who primarily focus on sport climbing, what kind of gym do you train in? If you do both, how do you split your time? What do you focus on in indoor rope sessions? How do you find it translates to your outdoor climbing?

TIA!
Asked Chat GPT-4 to create an undulating 5-month training plan to improve my bouldering ability...plan seems surprisingly good? [removed]
Seeking advice on my Training Plan. Trying to reach V6 before end of year Hi everyone! I'm 29 y/o, and have been climbing since 2018 but had a hard stop last 2020 due to the pandemic, and I've been climbing in and out ever since.

**Goals**: To climb V6 before the year ends. (Or is 9 months too much?)  


**Background:** I have been climbing since 2018 mostly sport climb -  top rope and lead, both indoors and outdoors; my highest grade then was at 6B. I did not have a training plan then and just climbed as much as I can but since the pandemic I have not climbed consistently.   


I'm planning to get back to climbing, and right now, the most accessible gym for me are boulder gyms. Im currently at V3 consistently, tho i can send some V4s after a few attempts. V3w are relatively easy for me but the jump to V4s is quite huge. Im not sure if its the lack of technique or strength, but most probably a mix of both.  


Due to scheduling, I can only spend at most 2 climbing days per week. Seeking for advise to maximize my climbing days.  


**Training Plan (Per week):**  


Day 1:

Warm-up: Stretches, mobility exercises (shoulder and hips), light climbing for a total of 15 mins

Hangboarding: 5 sets of 10 seconds on, 50 seconds off, with 4 different grip positions

Bouldering: Spend 1 hour working on V4 problems 

Cool-down: stretching

  
Day 2:

Warm-up: Stretches, mobility exercises (shoulder and hips), light climbing for a total of 15 mins

Bouldering: 4x4 drills on V2-V3 

Cool-down: Stretching  


\-------------|Increase hangboard and grade difficulty around 3 weeks or depending on progress |-----------  


I know its pretty bare bones, but I'm wondering if this is effective enough to see some gains.  


All comments/critiques welcomed.  


Cheers!
V10 training has begun #training I am hoping if I announce my goal, it will hold me more accountable for staying the course. I hope you enjoy my journey. 

For the last few years, I have been talking about bouldering V10. I have climbed a decent amount of problems at the V9 level and only one V10 (flashed) that has since been downgraded. If you are confused about these grades, check out this video and start at 2:55 https://youtu.be/cD4XHKBwe3I. Not a perfect explanation, but it should help.

I have not done anything specific to achieve this goal aside from talking about it and just climbing. As many of you know, I have been dealing with a back injury I suffered at the gym in February of 2022. I have not found much relief. Monday, I woke up and tried to put on my inner Goggins (David) and told myself the back was fine and it was time to train.

For context I just turned 59, March 31st, happy birthday to me. I started climbing when I was 25 and try to climb at least 2-3 days a week. I include some additional strength work at home. As of the last few years, my climbing grade outside is V6-7. I did one V8 a few years ago. I genuinely believe I can do whatever I put my mind to, so this should be an interesting journey to see what is still possible. At a minimum, I will grow and learn, and ultimately that is a win, but sending the V10 and beyond would be awesome!

I decided to take a different tack and see if hitting specific strength benchmarks would help me achieve my goal. The benchmarks are measurable and should make it easy to track my progress.

The path I am taking follows the 9c strength test: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srY3ZCKXGuw&t.

My first workout benchmarks for the four tests are: 
1. Max Finger Strength 150% of body weight (I weigh 160LBS/70KG), 6 pts
2. Max Pull-ups 137% of body weight (added 60 pounds), 4 points
3. Core L-Sit, programming is 20 seconds. I did 30 seconds. 6 points
4. Hang off Pull Up Bar (Deadhang). 2 minutes, 4 pts

I scored 20 total points for the initial session  Tuesday. Thursday night was workout # 2, and I increased the total to 22 points. I raised my max finger strength to 170% of my body weight and my max pull-ups to 140%. The goal is 26. 

At this point, I think I am maxed out and now have to work on supplemental exercises to move each metric up. If I can improve weighted pull-ups and core, I should be more balanced and achieve my initial test goal. From there, I need to find my V10 to project.

I know these metrics will not guarantee success but I need something to add to my normal routine of technique refinement and see where it takes me. I am most curious to see what happens in 90, 180, 365 days.

By the way, the back seems to be cooperating; hoping this trend continues.

I hope you enjoy the journey and that my back and body cooperate.
Wondering what my limiting factor is, and how I could continue to push grades without frequent access to hard climbs. I have been climbing for 5 years and am 16 years old. I've climbed V10 outdoors but I feel like I have the strength for more. I've been able to get 6 second one arm hang on 20 mm. I've got one arm pull ups down pretty well to the point where I can do around 3 reps in a row. I'm still working on front levers (lats have been the limiting factor for those). I feel like I should be climbing more than V10 and was wondering if technique was my biggest limiting factor and if so how can I train technique for these hard climbing without frequent access to them. I live in lowa where the nearest bouldering crag is 4 hours away and my gym doesn't really set higher than 8 or 9 and when they do it's very infrequent. 

I really can’t think of anything else that could be holding me back. Although I have really struggled to find climbs harder than V10 to project and really push my limits on. My gym does have a spray wall (which I am on practically 100% of the time) and I was wondering if I could effectively use this for training and if so, how. The thing I’m struggling with most is identifying which facet of my technique is needing work (and I know you guys can’t really tell me either) but if you had any common technical errors that climbers around this level face that would be really helpful just as a starting point. Any help is appreciated, thank you everyone!
Nail polish to prevent nail splits? Recently I’ve been doing a lot of high-angle crimping (aka turbo crimping), and although my pulleys and tendons seem to be doing great, I have been experiencing recurring nail splits. What this means is that my nail lifts from the skin, forming a “cut” which hurts a lot. Sometimes it will even bleed.

After a long day of crimping outside, I will often get 2-3 nail splits. They’re usually not too bad, but occasionally the pain will be excruciating. I can somewhat prevent them with superglue and tape, but this gets annoying. I’ve been dealing with recurring nail splits for nearly 4 months now.

I have seen Mani the Monkey’s video on this, where he recommends keeping the nails slightly longer. This absolutely does not work for me, it even makes it worse.

I’m wondering if I might benefit from strengthening my nails. I think the intense pressure of crimping may be laterally bending my nail, producing a shear force my nail-skin connection. I remember hearing that some people use nail polish for this reason.

Anybody have any experience with this? Or recommendations?
Improving ability and robustness around high intensity heel hooks. Advice on plan and on improving hamstring engagement. I don't think I'm getting the most out of heel hooks. Particularly on high overhanging ones where it's holding a lot of my weight. I find that this can be the limiting factor of me successfully getting a move or not. Additionally I often feel pain or even pull/strain my calf muscles. Just yesterday I pulled it quite badly on a cave climb - this move involved a high left heel and left hand holding the entire body, I could not get much out of this as I needed and fell which causes me to pull my calf. 

When I do a heel hook I will try and rotate the toe outwards and engage my leg. This rotation of the toe tenses up the calf. However I know the heel hook should be quite a hamstring dominant exercise but I don't think I'm actively engaging the hamstring, in fact I find it hard to tense it (mind muscle connection etc). I suspect the pain I feel in the calf is a mixture of not engaging the right muscles and that my calf is just the weakest link in the chain. 

I've never really trained my calves explicitly, however my hamstrings are relatively strong (max deadlift is probably around 2x bodyweight). So I suspect there could be quite a large strength imbalance between them. I have looked around for resources on heel hooks but very rarely see anything mentioning the calf or calf pain, this article for example had a lot of useful information but nothing about calves. Various other threads I've seen also include people mentioning tension and pain in their hamstrings from heel hooks. I've never had any pain in my hamstrings from heel hooks but have had it in my calves many times.

https://www.ukclimbing.com/articles/injuries/improving_heel_hook_ability_and_reducing_injury_risk-13521 

So I'm coming to the conclusion that I need to improve my mind muscle connection with my hamstrings and more actively engage them on the heel hook so I can take some load away from my calves. Additionally I should try and train my calf strength.

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation or have any advice on things I may have missed? Particularly in terms of getting better engagement out of my hamstrings or ways of actively tensing them? I can tense my calfs and quads fine but find it hard to tense my hamstrings. 

My current plan of action is to 

- be more conscious with my muscle engagements when I do a heel hook and actively try and engage my hamstrings.

- improve calf strength. Weighted calf raises is the first thought that comes to mind.

- directly warm up calves and hamstrings before attempting high intensity heel hooks. Both for the mind muscle connection and for injury prevention.
High Gravity Days Hi guys (and gals and everything in between), I've been noticing a trend lately in sessions which has got me kind of stump on how to approach this. As you can guess by the title, I get pretty frequent "high gravity days" and I thought it was just a common thing I need to put up with, but lately I've been noticing on days I either work from home or am off from work, I'm consistently climbing about a full grade harder. I work a pretty boring accounting job in NYC which isn't the most stressful gig, but you can imagine keeping up appearances with a bunch of finance bros for 8 hours can be pretty emotionally draining. I don't really have friends at work which I'm honestly ok with. I'm pretty good on that front outside of work, but I think the days I go into the office just totally drain me. I would compare the feeling to a fried CNS after a super hard limit bouldering day. Today I was really struggling to try hard on really anything at my gym. Even when I tried some easier routes I struggled with driving through my feet and optimizing technique.

Currently I go to a bouldering gym 3 days a week. One day is a limit day, another is a projecting day, and the last is a flash/technique focus day where I'll repeat boulders if I feel like I can really clean up my beta/movement. I might be switching up the order and days a bit soon since I'm hoping to climb a lot at central park now that its getting warmer.

My question is what do you think I should do on these high gravity days? I go into the office M-W so if I try to have at least one rest day between sessions, I'll have to have one session on these days. Should I use this for my technique/volume day? Should I drink a crap ton of caffeine? Should i get an adderall prescription? Should I just not climb these days? I'd rather keep a session to one of these days so my weekends are more open to non climbing activities and I really do like having a rest day between all my sessions. I do try to climb with friends for all my sessions, but we all work full time so that is pretty inconsistent when you consider lots of ppl work late. Lmk if you have ever had chronic high gravity days and if anything worked for you. Also lmk if you have a B plan in general for high gravity days. Currently they kinda feel like a wasted session and I'm hoping that I can fix that.
I didn’t realize how important projecting was I was “stuck” on V8 indoors for quite a long time. Got lazy and barely tried harder climbs. I had done 15+ V8s so that should’ve been indicative of something, but I’d really focused on flash and day flash. If something seemed hopeless, I’d move on.  
  
Well eventually I heard a lot about the importance of projecting and also started to climb with stronger climbers more often. I wanted to stick with the group so I tried “impossible” moves over and over again, trying to get better. I quickly realized that sometimes it just takes trying a move a few times for it to feel 100 times easier.  
  
I started to project more and more alone as well, and yesterday, I sent my first indoor V10! I also started to flash V8s which I had never been able to do before. Yes it was a soft V10 for sure, but I’ve grown a ton and it has only been a couple months since I started to introduce projecting days into my schedule.  
  
Projecting doesn’t need to mean spending a whole session on a climb either. You can totally just give a small number of quality attempts and try to actually figure a move out rather than falling and saying “that’s way out of my league” or passing by hard climbs just because they have a scary number or look like they have difficult moves.  
  
Thanks to this sub for projecting advice and just wanted to pass it forward since I hadn’t heard about it too too much.
Retrospective Post: 10 Years in a bouldering journey I've been having a pretty breakout season climbing and there seems to be some interest in a retrospective post. I feel like its going to get a little rambling, but hopefully this is useful. I'm happy to answer any questions or clarify anything.

**Background:**  Going into climbing I was a scrawny guy who wasn’t a sports person. I ran cross country in high school, but that was over a decade removed from climbing which I started when I was 28. I quickly fell in love and started taking it seriously.

Due to my location, I only had access to indoor climbing which was was 30-45 minutes away. Coupled with a physical job with long hours, it was hard for me to get to the gym. I spent a lot of time on the hang board when I couldn’t make it to the gym, Rock Prodigy method was all the rage. I spent more time hang boarding than climbing. In early 2017 I moved to Colorado and had a lot more access to climbing. In early 2020, I left my physical job with long hours and now have an office job. I am generally better rested and more able to get outside to climb.

**Current physical stats**: 37m, \~155lbs, 5'8", +1" ape index. At my lowest I weighed 135lbs when I sent my first v5-7. At my most \~160lbs sending v10. I generally test well in any strength metric at this point, primarily because I've trained for most of my climbing life.

**Progression:** I think looking at first and second of a grade plus total number sent are all important. First is well first, but how long did it take to do another? Was it a long time and if so why? Etc. Its an important evaluation tool. Total number lets you really see how flat my pyramid is. All base.

|**Grade  (total sent RP/Flash)**|First of|Second of|
|:-|:-|:-|
|v4 (33/25)|early 2015|early 2015|
|v5 (37/14)|late 2015|early 2017|
|v6 (51/14)|late 2015|early 2017|
|v7 (39/7)|late 2015|early 2017|
|v8 (38/4)|late 2017|mid 2018|
|v9 (12/1)|mid 2018|late 2019|
|10 (12/0)|late 2018|mid 2020|
|v11 (1/0)|April 2023|X|

**The recent season:** 2023 has been incredible for my climbing thus far. I really think *longevity* is key to success in this sport so I am going to include my 2022 season and outcomes in the analysis as well. On paper its a solid season, but isn't breakout or anything that special. I had on average less at the very top but much more v9 and below.

2022 stats - 47 days out – 1x v10, 6x v9 (1flash), 11x v8 (1flash), 8x v7 (1flash), 15x v6 (4flash)  
2023 stats as of April 10 – 20 days out - 1x v11, 6x v10, 2x v9, 5x v8 (1flash), 4x v7 (2flash), 9x v6 (4 flash) 

An important note is that in 2022 September I was very close to sending my first v11 but sustained an overuse injury on one of my fingers. Up until that point in the year I didn’t try any v10s. I spent most of my time working submax problems in the v8/9 range while warming up for my project. As I was healing up from the injury I started picking harder problems which didn’t aggravate the injury which is how I picked up the one v10 of the year. As I was healing I also spent the time ticking a lot of climbs of various styles in the v6-8 range. 

Hopefully I'll refer to the above information through the rest of the post. As a note, there is more than enough talk about the physical aspects of training. They don't really interest me for a post like this. We all know having strong fingers, shoulders, late are important. How strong do they need to be? Well, that depends on the factors below (and more)

**Things that have improved my climbing the most**

*Access to climbing (and training) is crucial*

* This one was huge for me, being able to really project something rather than just work a problem on a trip really opened up the doors to higher grades. My first v8 took 5-6 days. For the length of trips I could take at the time, that probably means 3ish years of effort. Living near the boulder means it took me less than a month. 
* Being near climbing means more time on rock. I got to learn how to move on it, the nuance and the general tactics of going outside. Long days, short days. Easy/hard hikes etc. They all require different skills. Experience is king.

*Your pyramid matters*

* If you look at my 2022 sends, you see a pyramid that really builds to the 2023 season I am currently having. While I think its very fun to look at my overall pyramid because it shows my whole climbing "career" when setting goals I look more in 6-12 month ranges depending on how active I've been in the sport. 
* When building and evaluating your pyramid consider style, rock type, and whatever other factors are important to your goal. My general goal is to be a well-rounded climber, so my pyramid needed to be well rounded.   
* Don't overlook second tier problems. If possible, whenever I'm projecting I try to warmup and climb every problem in an area. No matter how dumpy or lowball or if its dirty. You'll learn a lot along the way.

*Try Hard*

* For most of my time climbing I've been terrible at trying hard. It felt unnatural. To that end I incorporated try hard in my training drills. 
* 2023 is the first time I've really tried hard and its been a game changer. More than half of this years v9+ sends have had things go wrong. In previous seasons I might have stopped the try or fallen because things didn’t feel right and I had to try harder than expected. I’ve thrown that mentality out. If I’m on the wall and it’s a red point or flash go within safe territory, I’m trying as hard as possible. 

*Learn how to train skills*

* I think we often forget how complex climbing is. Train new skills on easy climbs and work upwards slowly overtime. Early last year I noticed I hold my breath when I climb. I started actively practicing breathing on the wall. The first 5 climbs of the day while warming up I took a breath after each hand move. Overtime I increased the difficulty of the climbs where I actively worked this. At some point I noticed that I breath naturally while I climb. This has helped my climbing immensely and leaves me with gas in the tank. Do I breath after ever hand move on hard climbs? Of course not, but I always take advantage of breathing when I can now. 

**Smaller but still important**

*Outside perspective*

* You don't know what you don't know. Many of the biggest realizations in my movement came from outside perspectives. Typically a stranger or coach, something my regular partners hadn't noticed because it was part of "my style."

*On video beta*

* Video beta is great. I often have video on my phone for the first time I go to a climb. But not always. I believe there is huge value in problem solving on your own. I set personal guidelines for when I will try to figure out a problem on my own vs looking at video. 
* Learn the intrinsic nature of movement rather than mimicking others will progress your climbing.

*Climb awkward problems, uncomfortable with bad feet*

* Outdoor climbing isn't as comfortable as most gym climbing. Practice being in uncomfortable (not painful) body position and on climbing with hard to use feet. 
* This [article](https://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/2018/1/14/rock-climbs-make-terrible-gym-problems) covers it well

Hopefully this wasn't too much rambling for everyone.
"Low strength" training advice- how important are pull-ups really? Edit: Thanks so much everyone for the discussion and input. I revise my last paragraph about the weight from building muscle counteracting it's usefulness at some point, sure this can happen with body builders but I get it's not much of a concern as far as functional strength. 
Gathered from this that rows, pullups, and steep bouldering will be helpful. Still a bit wary about those lattice strength test things (skill in a movement is built by doing that movement, I am bad at pullups cause I don't do them. Their bell curves are more a measure of "the majority of good climbers also practice pullups", correlation does not equal causation ect) BUT it's clear being able to pull harder will never hurt. 

Edit: apostrophe instead of period on the grades

Hello, 

I am a solid 5.11 outdoor sport climber looking to break into 5.12. I think I have gotten as far as I can with "just climbing", I have never done any climbing specific training other than just climbing. 

I am looking for advice specifically for more low-strength climbers. I am pretty certain strength is my limiting factor- I can do maybe 2 pullups. I have a low bodyweight and good flexibility and technique so I have never really needed to do more. 

Obviously I'll be training pullups, but I am not totally convinced how applicable this movement is to climbing. I think their importance might be a bit overstated by dudes who are naturally better at them. Have other climbers seen good progress from training just pull-ups? 

I do know I should put on some upper body muscle, but I am not sure at what point the weight from the extra muscle counteracts the usefulness. A lot of climbers pride themselves in being strong / doing a lot of pull-ups but I can still out climb them with my lower upper body strength because of having a light frame and good technique. 

Advice / discussion appreciated
How important is climbing skin - any tips/tricks/suggestions? I just realized my skin sucks. It's very dry, and almost always in a state of peeling (even when not climbing). I recently started using different climbing creams/moisturizers (rhino skin repair, jtree salve, o keefe's working hands, aveeno hand cream) religiously throughout the day, and the difference when I'm on the wall is ridiculous. Everything feels so sticky, I never feel like I'm going to dry fire, and I'm able to pull and try so much harder. I had been stuck on moonboard V5's (have done more than half of all benchmarks) and only ticking off one every two or three sessions. My last session I did SEVEN of them. The hardest I climb in my gym is around v6, last session I got close to finishing out an 8. 

It's just crazy to me how much of a difference my skin makes. It's the only thing I changed, so I stopped moisturizing to see if it really was responsible for that huge difference and my skin immediately (within 4 days) went back to its natural dry/peeled state. So when I tried climbing again I was blowing off all the same moves on the 8 that I had done previously. Is this normal for skin care to make such a huge difference? Or is my skin just truly terribad? Any other skin tips aside from moisturizing religiously throughout the day and before sleeping?
Bechtel's Density Sessions As far as I know, Steve Bechtel references what he refers to as "density bouldering sessions" in two different places. The goal of these sessions is to pick a set of problems, either on a board or a set that won't change for 4-6 weeks, and perform 2-3 sessions a week where you gradually increase your workload (by decreasing the rest interval) at a fixed grade in a fixed period of time.

One article is from his Climbstrong website titled 'Intro to Density Training' and the other is from a Climbing Mag article titled 'Train Climbing Endurance by Bouldering, Part 3'.

In the Climbstrong piece he recommends picking 3-4 problems at or ABOVE flash level, cycle through them for 20 minutes, rest 20 minutes, then repeat another 20-minute block. Repeat 2-3 times per week for 3-5 weeks.

In the Climbing piece he recommends several problems 1-2 grades BELOW flash, cycle through them for 10 minutes, rest 10 minutes, then repeat another 10-minute block. He similarly recommends 8-12 sessions.

Despite calling both "density bouldering sessions," to me these seem to be quite different, with significant differences in intensity AND volume/duration.

My questions:

1- Are these two sessions targeting different energy systems to a significant degree? If so, which energy systems are at play?

2- Is anyone familiar enough with Steve's work to know if he's addressed his change in thinking here?

EDIT: For clarity, the structure of both sessions is identical, but the one described on Climbstrong (written at least a few years ago) is twice the volume at a higher intensity than the one from Climbing Magazine (written in the last 6 months).

Edit #2: I'm posting the copied texts from each article for reference

From the Climbstrong article: 

"Here’s the basic set-up: Pick 3-4 problems at your onsight level or just a bit above. You can choose these to simulate a specific route you’re trying or you can choose a few different styles if you’re training for onsighting/general fitness. Get some chalk on your hands, strip down to your tank top and get crackin’. You’re going to set a clock for 20 minutes, and start climbing through problems 1-4 as quickly as your muscles will allow. Rest as needed between problems, but keep track of the total number of successful sends you get.

Most climbers will be able to get 10 or more problems the first time. You’re going to want to rest about 20 minutes after the first bout, then hit another 20 minutes of density-either on the same 4 problems or 4 new ones. The big key to this workout is repeating it. You’ll see the best results if you do it 2 or 3 times per week for 3-5 weeks. By the end, you should be hitting close to 20 problems each set. Most of our athletes improve by 50-75% each time we roll through a 4 -week block."

From the Climbing Mag article: 

"Density sessions are all about fitting more work at a given workload into a fixed time period. For this workout, we’ll again use the 10-minute timer, but this time, we will go just a bit harder on the initial problems. Instead of aiming for easy as possible, as we do in the OTM session, these problems should be one to two grades below your flash level. Once you’ve determined the difficulty of the problems, make sure you know several problems in this zone well. Playing around with your app or trying to onsight will slow you down substantially.

Once you’re warmed up, set a timer for 10 minutes and start climbing. Note each problem as you complete it, and rest as needed between problems. At the end of 10 minutes, take a break of 10 more minutes, then repeat another 10 minutes of density climbing. In this workout, you might get only 6 to 7 problems in 10 minutes at first. This is fine. In the density sessions, we’ll advance the climbing differently than we do in OTM. Rather than trying to increase the difficulty of the sets, we will instead pursue more total climbing per 10-minute block. This might look like just one more problem per workout, but over the course of a full cycle of endurance, the changes will be great."
How do you work on linking a problem when you can get every move, but inconsistently. I’m talking about bouldering here, but anything is welcome related to climbing in general. For context I spend most of my time indoors around V6-V8 range, max V10. I climb outdoors occasionally and am trying to go outdoors more this season.
  
In the past, if I could do every move, I would usually be able to send the boulder in that same session or next session if I figured out the move at the end of a session. The limiting factor was almost always the difficulty of the moves and not the linking. This might’ve been due yo my lack of projecting and staying too far in my comfort zone.
  
In any case after getting to the V8 range, I’ve started to find problems where I can do every move in isolation, but it feels impossible to link. One thing is just physical endurance like getting partway up a boulder and then being too tired to pull to the next one. In a lot of those cases I’ve found that just getting more comfortable with the moves and working slowly on more moves in sequence helps. Doing power endurance training also seems to help with this kind of limitation.  
  
The harder issue for me to deal with is when it feels limited because of transitions, low probability moves, or very delicate/coordinated moves.
  
I don’t feel like I’m getting too tired to do any of the moves, but there just feels like a million different things that I have to pay attention to or else I’ll fall off. It’s kind of a weird analogy but it almost feels like in the circus when someone is balancing 34 objects at the same time.  
  
I know what to do for every move. If I fall I know what I did wrong, usually that I lost tension, put my hand/foot millimeters too high or low, etc. Just seems so hard to execute in a row given that every move is like a certain percent chance to get. And often times with enough brute forcing, I can get it, but it feels like nothing changed and that I’ll have to brute force it again to get it all to link.  
  
As I’ve followed strong climbers more I have been seeing more cases where people have a long time between being able to do all the moves and actually being able to send it. Of course at some point if you’re strong enough everything becomes more consistent, but is there any other strategy to try to link these types of moves other than “just get stronger”?
No Hang Training progression for a beginner. Yay or Nay? Hey Folks,

I've been climbing for a year and just purchased a No Hang Device.

I come from a weightlifting background, and like many others, I've experienced the benefits of progressive overload training. So, I'm curious as to why this approach isn't recommended for grip training using a NoHang device (such as the Tension Block).

The general consensus is that beginners should avoid Hangboard training for at least a year to prevent injuries. However, I've noticed there's a lack of beginner-friendly hanging routines. To me, it's like telling a cyclist to begin barbell squat training with 130% of their body weight on the bar.

That's where the NoHang device comes in handy. One could start training with body weight percentages much lower than 50% (assuming that's how much each hand/arm is pulling) and gradually increase the weight.

For instance: Begin with a small weight like, 10kg/22lbs and complete 5 reps of pulling on a 20mm edge for 5 seconds, or do 8 reps. In the next session (or alternatively, the following week), add 1.25kg/2.75lbs and continue increasing the weight each session/week until you 'fail'. Aim for 2-3 sessions a week. If you fail, repeat the last session or deload if necessary. The key to avoiding injury lies in how you define failure, which could range from not being able to pull/dropping the weight to simply not feeling strong.

This progression method seems logical to me, but please correct me if I'm mistaken. The risks I see are either progressing too rapidly for tendon and strength adaptation or too slowly for efficient gains.

**So, my main question is: Assuming this protocol is sound, Can't we recommend a protocol like this to absolute beginners? I'm talking about someone who's been climbing for only two months or so.**

**TL;DR**: Why don't we prescribe low-weight progressive overload routines for complete beginners?
I've been working on a no-fluff training website, here's the first version I have been working on this site to help with my training and have been using it myself for a couple weeks now. I just wanted to see if anyone is interested in using it or wants to help out.

If anyone wants to work on this with me by giving feedback or sharing ideas message me here or email me (my email is on the site). **I would love to work closely with anyone who is interested so we can develop an effective tool set.**

It's really simple right now, but I'm working on this full time so it moves fast.

This is all 100% free.

The current goals of the site are to help us:

1. create long term training plans
2. log data for exercises and other general metrics
3. visualize data to track injuries, consistency, or strength training progression

Here's how it works and some general info at the bottom.

**Journal**

* Keep a daily journal for general notes
* Quickly log data directly into your account from here. The data is connected to the notes and date.

**Training Programs**

* Design complex weekly training programs
* Log exercises each day, compare with training program for completion
* Yes the week starts on Monday, that decision was made possibly too quickly lol I plan on adding an option in your user profile for that

https://preview.redd.it/lchmb5k9tgua1.png?width=2090&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9649e1f1f3bb3b2f1ee7c060b6fc038ed6fba50a

**Charts**

* Visualize your training by adding charts to your dashboard
* track consistency or progress with line, bar, and heatmap charts

https://preview.redd.it/ksaa6aw5zgua1.png?width=2090&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=049944516d0ac674cba8191e2a960c6b0faf8bd9

**Stuff I'm working on**

* Complex charts
   * I'd like to be able to combine charts/metrics to be able to track complex indicators such as overall load on fingers, etc.
* Allow users to export their charts to images
* Allow users to export their data to CSV
* 52 week planner connected to training programs
* Habit tracker
   * keep track of daily tasks for PT
* Program sharing
   * Allow other users to share, copy and use public training programs

**Data disclaimers**

Your data is yours—I will never sell or share any of it for any reason. No external tracking tools (e.g. Google Analytics) have been or ever will be added to the website. If I want to see how many people are visiting a page or something I’ll run the fucking query myself. I won’t let anyone snoop through any of your training *or* browsing data, I hate that shit.

**Early version disclaimers**

Keep in mind that this is a super early version I made in a couple weeks. The goal was to be fully functional and have zero clutter, not to be super pretty. It is also not very well optimized for mobile which is a shame. I’ll be working on that soon.

That being said, if anything seriously bothers you lmk and I’ll prioritize it.

Starting in mid-40's I love reading this forum. Have learned a ton here since I started climbing a year and a bit ago. I'm always looking out for tips for middle age climbers. Hilariously, I'm reading many of you think it's all over once you hit your 30's, but I digress... I've also read a lot of tips from senior crushers that started young and are still crushing in their 50's to 70's. Very inspiring stuff.

What I'm curious about if anyone has experience or tips for people \*starting out\* at this age, rather than folks building on a foundation they created in their teens, 20's or 30's. Looking for training ideas and also gotchas.

In the spirit of the posts I see here, a little background about where I am:

\- Mostly an indoor lead/TR climber due to not living near crag, but consider indoor climbing as training for outdoor trad, which is what I enjoy most and get to do a handful of weekends a year. And recognizing I'm old, rope will probably have the most longevity for me as I get weaker with age.

\- FWIW, indoor bouldering grade (V3 flash) and rope (.10 flash, most .11s redpointable, occasionally bag a .12 that plays to my strengths).

\- According to others and my own diagnosis, RELATIVE strengths are I'm super flexible, apparently have good footwork, am low bf, good stamina and strong core/fitness level (can do a lot more pullups, situps blah blah than you'd expect for over the hill dude). I do decently on a variety of climbing styles (slab, crack, overhanging, slopers, roofs, etc.) but frequently get shut down on moves that require hard finger pulling (pockets, crimps w/ bad feet, wide or overhung pinches).

\- My self-diagnosed RELATIVE weakness is fingers are weak and get injured easily. I've injured my fingers twice now (1st time pulleys, 2nd time joint synovitis), each time took multiple months to recover, during which time I would work on my footwork and rope skills). I've recently done 2 hangboarding cycles which have helped me tremendously to get from what felt like negative finger metrics to the starting line. Could not hang BW on 20 mm edge until this month. Now that I can, it REALLY feels so much better grabbing small holds. Big mistake early on was I full crimped every difficult hold, now I'm training half crimp and open on HB so hopefully less injury prone in future.

Open to any and all advice, but also have a few specific questions for you gurus of the rock:

\- My gym has a moonboard. Every time I try to use it, my fingers feel like they're going to break. Similarly, I've stayed away from bouldering wall lately because many of the V4+ holds feel like they will mess up my fingers again. Stay away from big dynos due to injury potential. Should I go back to these and when? My arms, core and legs all feel very capable for equivalent problems when holds are bigger, but the bad holds really get me. Especially stuff I can't put \*all\* my fingers on, these feel the worst.

\- I sometimes climb with some 20 year olds. Damn, you younguns heal so much faster than me! I know older people heal more slowly so key to stay injury free, but is there anything else to watch out for? It feels like some training adaptations like finger tendons are taking way longer, even if muscular strength is coming along nicely. Is there anything physiological about this? Any other things to watch out for? I feel strong, but I also know the "internals" of a middle-age man just aren't going to be as robust as a teenager.

\- Any good training tips? I know I have much still to learn for route-reading and technique on the wall. Max hangs have done wonders and I intend to continue, I started assisted OAPs to equalize my much weaker left arm, have started to strengthen wrists with barbells, and do all the antagonist muscles on nonclimbing days. Getting adequate rest/sleep generally and recently learned how much stronger you get when you take a whole week off. Climb rope twice a week, hangboard once a week or twice a week if I cut a climbing session in half - all due to schedule and climbing partners. What should I cut, what should I add?

Goals: Keep stoke for the climbing and training high, stay injury free, improve so I can climb as many different styles of outdoor routes as possible. TL;DR I want to be a trad dad that crushes, but I mostly train indoors due to location/schedule.

The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the 2nd best is... TYVM all for your advice!
Am I making a mistake by focusing on only doing hard moves instead of sending the problem Recently each bouldering training session, I've focused primarily on doing individual hard moves that are close to my limit or individual links of hard moves on a boulder problem. Once I have all the moves figured out and the problem in 2 or 3 overlapping parts, I don't have that much of a desire to send the problem. Once in a while, if the problem is nice or I have done the moves in like 5 parts instead of having them in 2 parts, I'll try to send it. I find that this strategy has allowed me climb a lot more than I used to be able to (2 consecutive sessions of 3 hours each on the short spray wall while feeling fresh each time). I also feel like I'm learning a lot more because I'm much more focused on reflecting on the mechanics I need to apply for the move to be easier and finetuning microbeta each time I'm getting on the wall. Like I mentioned, I'll still try to send the problem once in a while but it's not really my primary focus. Also, if I do try to send the problem, it's a problem on the short spray wall and most of the problems are like 4-5 moves max. What are some of the pitfalls to this? I guess endurance could be an issue but I always feel like that's pretty easy to train (doing 4x4's for example). I want to continue this for another month or until I feel like I notice it's not working. Any advice?
Indoor bouldering - projecting vs volume I've been climbing for around 3 years. Hardest routes I've done are sport outside 5.11b and inside bouldering V6. Regularly climb all grades below this.

I have been climbing outside 1-3 days a week weather permitting. I've bouldered outside only once or twice as it's not really my thing, the local crag is close enough.

I climb outside to have fun and don't mind so much about getting better at that as there's loads of easy stuff I haven't done. I hope to get better with time but am not pushing grades yet. It's getting to the stage where I want to work a bit harder at this but I know how I could do this (i.e. try harder routes)

Indoor bouldering, however, is something I really want to get better at. I see at as more training than just having fun and it's satisfying to get harder grades sent.

With my 1-3 days of indoor bouldering, would it be a good idea to spent 2 days (or 1) projecting and 1 extra day working easier routes for mileage ? I've reached a bit of a standoff with bouldering where anything below V6 is a flash or send in a few attempts and therefore not very satisfying and everything V6 or above is a project, which I enjoy doing but not sure if focussing too hard on this will weaken my general climbing.

Bonus question : indoor / outdoor excluded, assuming 4 days of climbing a week, how many of these should be projecting vs gaining mileage ?
Following the no-hang hype : rehab and implementation in hangboarding routine, a personnal experience I usually train fingers on the hangboard, doing mainly half-crimps one-hangdead hang on the BM2000 center edge with a pulley system (I find it works greatfor building stabilization and lock-off strength) and 2 handed 3-finger drags.I have used no hangs as rehab from a finger injury for 3 months,1 year ago.They helped me greatly regain confidence in my ability and, I think, enabled afaster return to climbing and hangboarding.Recently, with all the “hype” around no-hangs (both Yves Gravelle and hooper’sBeta video), I went back to them, using them as warm-up before my hangboardsessions (2/3 times a week).

(For context I weight 71kg (156lbs) and I no-hang with the problem solver’srobot 14mm edge. My flash grade is around V5-6 and project around V8)

Over a 4 weeks-period, I built up to 60kg (132lbs) no hang and I went fromhanging 7 seconds with -9kg (20lbs) on the BM2000 center edge, to 7 seconds-5kg (-11lbs). This have been a uge progress for me, as I usually gain like 1or 2kg by hand over a classic max-strength cycle. My two-arm dead hangs didn’tevolve.

Today, my max on 14mm edges are :-no-hang 84% BW by hand-2 arms dead-hangs 78% BW by hand-1 arm dead-hang 83% BW by hand.

I feel like no-hangs enabled me to have a better recruitment of my wrist andforearms. Moreover, they really works great as a warm-up as it enables reallyprogressive finger loading. I am more confident while training on the hangboardand climbing (I mainly use a spraywall and happen to live near Fontainebleau)and now even sometimes use them isolating my fingers(mono), lifting small weights.However, when I lift at my max, they tend to cause me painful muscularcontractions (like mini-cramps) in the upper back (around the scapula), so Ithink I’ll no longer go that heavy and only use them for warm-up, fingerrecruitment on lighter days.  
I’m sorry for my English that is far from perfect,Wish you all a fine day !
People who don't half crimp properly or well: how is it affecting your climbing? Hi all,

I'm wondering if some of the stronger climbers here have a stronger open hand/three finger drag max hang numbers over half crimp. My numbers are dramatically different (my open is almost double in weight from my half) and I'm concerned that there's such a dramatic difference between the two.

FWIW:

* Project: V9+
* BW: 140#
* Max hangs, 10 seconds, open crimp:  85# + BW
* Max hangs, 10 seconds, half crimp: 40# + BW

I have two issues that prevent me from half crimping efficiently:

1. Physiologically, my fingers won't bend into proper half crimp form, but it's more like a chisel kind of deal with my PIP points upward, but the 90 degree bend is there. [Something like this.](https://preview.redd.it/6465e59lu4e91.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5dc9a4e579dd5265e23810e7d8e15603cbd8b6cc)
1. My left MCP joint on my middle finger has osteoarthritis. If I'm not mindful of inflammation, it 100% affects how I half crimp. 

Can someone else with similar numbers or physiological similarities comment on how you've worked with this? 

Thanks!

*Hope posting this is OK, I thought  this was a bit more than a simple question.*
Advice for reducing recovery time I've been climbing for about a year now since I started again after a long break. Before that, I climbed for a couple years but kept pushing myself too hard and didn't rest enough between sessions. This resulted in persistent overuse injuries (bad golfer's elbow and tennis elbow).

I've been doing better at pacing myself this time and have gotten back to about the level I was at before I had to stop for a long time (projecting V5 inside) but this time without any overuse injuries. 

However, it feels like my recovery time between sessions is quite long which is frustrating because I want to climb more often! After a hard session, three days rest is the minimum for me but usually I need more like 4 or 5.

I'm looking for advice on how to train so that I can reduce my recovery time in between sessions. Are there any methods that have been proven to be effective? I already stretch daily, use a massage gun on tight muscles and try to stay well hydrated.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.
Getting stronger after a finger injury This is my first post so sorry if this belongs in the injuries thread but I wanted to add a bit more background and get some more specific advice. 

I had a pretty bad A2 injury in early January, for then next three months I was pretty good about rehabbing it and it was feeling very good in late March when I was able to both sport climb outdoors and boulder sesh in the gym with little to no pain. This month I’ve gotten back into training with the goal of having a good bouldering season before summer hits. I’ve got tons of psyche and have regained my strength pretty quickly and have been training pretty regularly (2-3 sessions per week, minimum of 1 day rest between). 

Now the problem: my finger is feeling more tweaky the more I train. It started off ok, but after a hangboard session where I think I over did it just a bit, after each bouldering session it stays sore for a little longer. I’ve stayed off the hb since then. I’m frustrated because I really thought I rehabbed it well. 

I am confident that if I changed my training plan to focus on sport it would heal well over the next several months (endurance/volume instead of power/intensity). The only problem is I have no psych to sport climb now but I’m over eager to the point of injuring myself to boulder atm. 

Now my questions: how do I train max strength and power without reinjuring my finger? I know it’s kind of a stupid question but I’m genuinely curious if you guys have any tips. My finger rarely if ever gets tweaky if I’m climbing outside, it’s only in the gym where I over do it. So I feel like if I can make gains without hurting it I could actually still have a successful season. But the level I feel I need to train my other fingers at to actually get gains (with high intensity low volume) is going to lead to reinjury.
How do you balance routesetting and training Bit of a vague one, but wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation.

I set routes at two gyms. The days fall over a 5 week pattern like so:

Week 1: 2-3 days
Week 2: 0 days
Week 3: 1 day
Week 4: 1-2 days
Week 5: 0 days

This doesn't look like a lot, but I find these days extremely fatiguing, especially as I tend to be setting the harder grades. One gym is not so taxing, but the other one, which is more frequent, leaves me feeling completely destroyed. We set about 20 routes in a day and each person tests each one multiple times.

I love setting, but am finding it increasingly difficult to balance it with any kind of training. I'm comfortable up to v7 and project V8. While my grade hasn't decreased, I've noticed a real decrease in strength this last year. 

I pick up a lot of minor injuries while testing the routes, before moves are dialled in, which has affected my training.

Has anyone else had a similar problem? 
I realise this is quite vague, but am interested to hear any experiences!

💪🐸

Edit: I set 3-5 routes a day, not 20! As a group we have to forerun 20, with every person trying each one at least once, but usually multiple times.
What route most perfectly plays to your strengths, and when are you going to try it? A thought experiment, in 3 parts. This is based on the general idea that you should train you weaknesses, but when it is time to try to perform at your highest level you play to your strengths.

(1) Describe a hypothetical climb that perfectly plays to your strengths; that is exactly your style. Be as specific as possible. Route vs boulder. Angle. Length. Rock type. Hold type(s). Movement style. Tempo. Etc...

(2) Name (i.e. specifically say what route and crag) a real-world route that closely matches the hypothetical route you just described. This should be something harder that your current level, but not by too much. Probably 1-2 grades above current level. Bonus points if it is something reasonably accessible to you, rather than something on another continent. Idea here is to name an attainable level-up goal route.

(3) Now that you've identified the perfect route to bring you to the next level, when are you going to try it? What (if any) intermediate steps are necessary or are you taking to be ready and able to try this next-step route?

Interested to hear how folks think about their ideal style, their goal setting, and their steps to get there.  Mainly intended as a fun though experiment. Spray away!
How do you improve technique? Some background: I have been climbing for around a year, and have become pretty addicted. I am just about breaking V6 now, having been balancing climbing with lifting and other sports, but I think the time has now come that I would like to really prioritise my climbing and really get up into those high grades.

My flexibility is definitely a weakness and one that I am trying to address (although I am sure I could probably do more on this front).

I am fairly strong, or at least I am confident with how to train for strength, so I don't think this is too much a limiting factor.

I also have a recurring elbow issue which I am trying to sort with physio, but it has made me extra aware of trying to approach climbs in such a way as to minimise the pulling power necessary - in other words, the importance of good technique!

So in summary, I am at a stage where I really want to hone in on technique, but I am struggling with exactly how to approach this. I have done all the googling and such and feel like I have an OK understanding of the theory, but actually applying it when on the wall is difficult.

I normally climb alone so don't really have the option of asking others to suggest what I could do differently, and I am a bit shy to strike up conversation with people at my climbing gym.

Any tips would be appreciated! Thanks

Edit: Thanks so much everyone, super super helpful. I have learned a lot and look forward to putting it into action.
Let's talk Power (Discussion) I've been wondering if most climbers' power training cycles are too short after having been to a lecture held by PT and doctor in chronic climbing injuries, Gudmund Grønhaug. If I understood him correctly, he said that you can basically increase power indefinitely without actually needing more strength and that you have no use of training max pull-up strength after 150% BW added. + He said that One-Arm pull-ups are completely useless for climbing.

That's a pretty strong stance to take on the matter and I know a bunch of coaches and professional climbers will not agree with those statements. But maybe he does have a point that max power, being able to recruit the strength you have to move really fast, is more specific to climbing and translates better to climbing than max strength after a certain threshold. I thought I'd ask all of you what you think of this?

I personally think there might be truth to it, but the number of 150% seems arbitrary, and saying one armers are useless is probably exaggerating.

To end the post, I have a few more questions for all of you! What's your favorite form of power training and why? How do you fit this into your training year? How much power training is the optimal amount for you according to you?
Pros and cons of training "true" half crimp after you realize you're trash at it Background: 
been climbing 10 years, always considered half crimp my strongest. I am generally hypermobile, so in this position, my middle knuckles (PIP joint) are higher than the tips of my fingers. I've come to realize that this is more of a full crimp. I always just considered the thumb wrap to be full crimp...

Hang data for 20mm ~7-10 sec:

-my fuller "half crimp": ~45lbs
-3 finger drag: ~25lbs
-"true" half crimp: less than 20 lbs

I recently started training 3 finger drag after I noticed it was significantly weaker.

Question:
What are the pros/cons of training a "true" half crimp?

Safer? Stronger? Or is it just variances in anatomy that don't matter as much?
I’ve had tweaky fingers for months, but still seeming to be getting stronger even operating below max? I know finger injuries are to be taken seriously, but also that you should not stop using your fingers completely. When I first got a minor injury a few months back, I took a week off from climbing completely.  
  
When I came back I climbed very light and it got better, but it never went away. I eventually healed from that, but I did a limit day on a crimpy project that brought up a new tweakiness in my pulleys. Took more light days before working up to projects, but eventually ended up adding another 3 tender pulleys to the mix.  
  
I’ve since started to back off on hard training and haven’t full crimped or done moonboard in forever. I recently got a no hang device and have been using that with 30% body weight for one hand on 15mm to help stimulate growth and that’s been helpful.  
  
That said, I feel like I’ve still gotten stronger. Yesterday, I visited a crimpy project that I used to need to full crimp hard on. I ended up getting further than I ever have before, but with an open hand and strength to spare.  
  
In general, it seems common to see climbers having tweaky fingers, but still being able to climb. At the same time it feels like it’s a recipe for disaster and every time someone ruptures a pulley or something like that, I’ve always heard that their fingers were achy before.  
  
In any case, what is recommended as the next course of action in this case. Would it be good to continue submaximally based on how my fingers feel? Or cut down volume and difficulty significantly to get my fingers completely fresh again? Or something else?
How do I train power endurance for a long boulder at my limit - or how to stop worrying and love the climb? Apologies for the title, couldn't resist.

I've been projecting this boulder that is at my max for the last couple weeks (about 7 sessions). The boulder is great for me because it targets my weaknesses as it is a technical climb while being power endurance focused. I have previously sent the V8 version, while the V10 extension I am working on traverses into the V8. I have pulled all the moves at this point dozens of times, the problem is that unfortunately the crux move is at the end of the climb and I can't seem to keep the endurance to pull it off. I've probably gotten to the last move around 10 times now and just been to gassed. The problem is that the boulder is 15 hand moves and about 20 foot moves with extremely poor feet for the first half of the climb while doing a lot of compression, so I feel like if I mess up even one of these moves I'm putting too much strain on my arms and will get to gassed. On top of that, I feel like I only have about 3-5 good tries in a session since the climb is so pumpy and powerful. 


I know that if I project it for long enough everything will come together and I'll get the send eventually. I'm strong enough to do the moves and can always refine my beta more and climb better to just have a little extra juice. I just don't know how long that will actually take. I suppose I'm looking for any tips or training people have done in similar scenarios that might relate to my supposed weakness here -power endurance when I'm doing moves at my absolute max. Are there repeaters I can do to help with finger strength or compression? Should I try to set a replica of the crux move and practice it like crazy when I'm tired in the gym? 

Would really appreciate any advice as I'm getting a bit frustrated with my project at this point- even though I still like the climb overall. Thanks!
Here are some great projecting drills for sending hard climbs faster. * 10 Minute take downs.

Pick a climb, I usually program 3 in a session, 1 below your limit, 1 at your limit, and 1 above your limit. All 3 of those can change depending on your goals. Do your best not to get beta or read the route before you start the timer. During this 10 minutes your goal is not necessarily to send the climb, it is to  be able to problem solve faster. Now set a timer for 10 minutes, Start reading your problem and come up with with some beta plans. Your first try should always be to flash it, this way you start strong with a good effort. if you do not send, focus on where you fell from and try to work out all the moves from the fall. be sure to try and link at least 2 moves together for each part of the climb during the 10 minutes. Towards the end be sure to repeat all the moves you were able to do easily. After the 10 minutes is over, set a timer for a 3 minute rest, once the rest is done you get a strict 1 single attempt from the bottom. If you send that's great! if not it is okay. Go work on the next one. The reason you only get one attempt at the end is because it is do or die, you have to fight like it is the last time you will ever climb it.

&#x200B;

* Modified flash or trash.

Pick climbs just below your limit, you only get 3 attempts per climb. All climbs must be started from the very bottom. The focus of this is to build intuitive climbing close to your limit while having the added benefit of gathering information from the attempts before.

* Low point climbing.

While doing a project day and you can't send a climb start from about 90% up the climb (this is assuming the crux is not at the top or close to it) every attempt you do try starting lower and lower down the climb, until you are able to start from the bottom. then hopefully you have gathered enough information to send.

Please note this is mainly for indoor climbing training.
Are “creaky fingers” a sign of adaptation? And subsequently a good thing. When I boulder or fingerboard heavy and hard, I experience what me and my friends describe as “creaky fingers”. 
I would describe “creaky fingers” as fingers that take a little bit longer to open up and tend to move slower. I feels as if the joints are a little bit swollen and as a result you have use more effort to open and close them. 
(When I say effort I mean like 0.001 more effort). 
This goes when I have a day or two rest. 

Just going off my own anecdotal feeling I would say this is how your fingers feel when they are adapting to new stresses. Of course, without any injury or pain is good. 

Now I’ve explained what I mean by creaky fingers, is them a good thing? why do we experience it? And assuming no injury’s, is more, better?
Training to improve shoulder and finger strength at full span I've been climbing for 2 years now and have been slowly moving out of my V5 plateau closer to consistently sending V6s.

One of my weaknesses that I've noticed is my strength or power at full span. Particularly, as a very short guy (5ft or 153cm, even wingspan), I find that I have a lot of trouble pressing down through my fingers and shoulders if my arms are at full span to the sides and I don't have the height to get my shoulders above my points of contact (usually my finger tips or palms). It feels like an iron cross movement.

Another move I have trouble with is when I bump one hand out (usually very dynamically) to a wide position where my feet cut and I'm having to use my shoulders, fingers, and core to keep myself on the wall. If my hands are too wide (both elbows are beyond 90 degrees), I find it incredibly hard to hold. And these moves are getting increasingly common since higher grades often mean holds are farther apart.

For the most part, I've simply been trying to climb problems with these movements to get stronger in them but I was wondering if there was off-the-wall training I could do to improve. I'm also not accurately able to pinpoint which muscles I'm using so I haven't been able to look up many exercises specifically for this. So, my question is, what muscles am I using when doing these moves? And what off-the-wall exercises can I do to improve?

Thanks in advance.
Kilter board training for beginners I’ve been indoor bouldering for about 6 months, 3 times a week for 5 of that. I climb around 6A+ (V3) though have sent a couple of 6B (V4) projects. I am 30 years old, 5’10 and weigh about 90kg (198lbs).

My gym has a Kilter Board I want to start making the most of to try and get stronger and progress to sending the V4 climbs more frequently. I spent about an hour climbing on the board the other day at 35 degrees, on some of the V0 problems. I flashed all but one of them (which I managed second attempt). Despite flashing them they all felt quite difficult on both my core and fingers despite the low level of difficulty.

My questions are:

Is it worth using the Kilter Board this early on in my life as a climber?

How frequently should a beginner board climb?

Is there any benefit to climbing on a less aggressive angle to start with?

Why do ‘V0’ climbs on the board feel so difficult compared to the climbs at my gym?

Are there any training routine resources out there for the Kilter Board?
I can’t seem to try hard without reaggravating injuries which I thought were previously healed? I had some pulleys that are tender from overuse. Started to use pain as an indicator, rested, did some light exercises to get blood flowing, and then eased in to climbing. 
  
I hold back my strength and really try to get comfortable using no hangs as a good way to slowly warm up with controlled weight. Multiple times now, I get to a point where I’m at a couple weeks of climbing a bit harder and I feel ready to climb close to my limit again.  
  
I can do fine on the hangboard, but then I hop on a project and after a couple attempts the pain comes back and shows me that I haven’t really recovered yet. I think it’s because my recovery focuses on static climbing (so I can control force) and the static loads with hangboards. 
  
For context I usually project around V8-V10 and after I feel recovered, I’ve been able to send what I would call finger-intensive static V8s without much of an issue. But even doing V4/V5 moonboard problems starts to make my finger feel creaky again. I would call that style of climbing my preferred style as well (probably why I got the overuse injury in the first place) so I don’t think it’s from being unfamiliar. 
  
With this in mind, how do I know when I’m ready to try hard again? Do I need to just give longer before trying hard climbs? Do I need to have more contact strength stuff during that recovery phase (feels scary now that it’s pretty much the 3rd time reaggravating with moonboard style problems)? Something else?
Are we leaving gains on the table by not doing structured core strength training? Like a lot of climbers, I occasionally do some core work after a climbing session (leg lifts/ l-sits) but with less focus or consistency as the rest of my training. I find this is partly due to core training being a bit unpleasant/painful but also due to it being harder to quantify strength improvements numerically (as say adding 5kg to a weighted hang or pull up). As such I find a lot of people do long core endurance circuits which don’t really improve max core strength and it gets neglected somewhat.

I do a lot of training that simultaneously works my core as the stabilisers: weighted pull-ups, dips, HSPU’s etc. I’d say my core doesn’t feel like an obvious limiting factor - I can keep tension/pull in hard with my toes on a board at steep angles and get feet back on fairly quickly.  However, I’m starting to wonder if I’m missing out by not actively trying to improve my core strength over time like I do my fingers/pulling muscles/antagonists. 

I’ve heard Eric Horst say he thought his core was strong till he started deadlifting and saw his potential was a lot higher than he previous thought. The benefit with deadlifting is that (despite being a compound) it works the posterior chain and abs whilst being easy to quantify strength improvements.

On a related point, I have suspicions than my lower back is quite weak as I find deadlift type movements taxing on my lower back - and I don’t think my other training hits the lower back much. I wondering if training deadlift would improve upon this potential weak link and help improve my body tension whilst climbing.

So with these thoughts in mind I have a few questions and I’d be interest to hear some takes on them:

1. Should we be training core with the same focus to improve as we do fingers and pull strength? 

2. Can core strength be sufficiently increased as a by product from heavy calisthenic movements and board climbing? (Or is this suboptimal?)

3. Is deadlifting a good solution to getting quantifiable data for improving core strength/ body tension?

4. How important is the lower back in keeping tension on hard climbs? Can it be a hidden weak link in the posterior chain that holds climbers back?
Daily stretch and mobility routine? I’m looking to start a mobility & stretch routine daily. I’m thinking every Morning 15-20 minutes, it may be shorter or longer depending on what it entails. I’m a active person who alternate days of climbing and calisthenics/weight training. I’m looking to of course maintain mobility and flexibility but also progress and be able to aid my climbing and calisthenic skills

I’m thinking of having some stretches for hams, quads, hip flexors, chest, back, wrists, arms, shoulders and fingers. However I’m not sure for mobility 

Are there any must have components/stretches and mobility exercises that I should include or body parts that I should make sure to not neglect? Any advice is appreciated, thank you!
Tips for tackling a limit project with 2 possible betas ? Long story short I have a limit project I’m working that is a classic in the local area and would be a first of the grade for me ( 8a ). 

I’ve unlocked all the moves on it and absolutely stoked knowing this thing is possible for me. 

Although last session while working on a main link between moves I realised there was 2 possible betas I had available. I still left the session stoked knowing I had made some micro progress but also confused on how to approach next session. 

Where my issue lies is both betas even though vastly different seemed to be of the same difficulty. How should I approach this? 

Should I have one session dedicated to using one beta and the next using the other ? 

Any ever been in the same boat ? Any tips appreciated.
Grippy versus slippery skin? I mostly climb on the 2019 moonboard. I notice (mainly on the wood holds) that sometimes my skin feels moist and grippy, and sometimes it feels very dry and frictionless. This is completely unrelated to how strong my fingers or muscles are feeling. It is also seemingly unrelated to how many days I’ve taken off before climbing. On the days I feel grippy I can send new benchmarks. On the days I feel frictionless I tend to dry fire so much that I no longer feel like climbing. I use rhino repair skin and hand moisturizer daily, j tree salve every night while sleeping. Anybody able to help make sense of this frustrating issue?

I assume the days where I feel “grippy” is due to having good skin (that is, new layer of skin, plenty of rest)? And the bad days are due to having bad skin (peeling, dead skin, dry)?

Possible culprits in my mind: 

-Intermittent use of liquid chalk at home when I fingerboard train which maybe dries out my skin very badly and affects my subsequent moonboard days?

-Use of intermittent wooden finger board/no hang itself wrecking my skin at home and affecting subsequent days?

I finger train too intermittently to have noticed a correlation but am trying to track the above metrics now to hopefully pinpoint the problem
What Do You Think Was The Main Factor That Helped You Break Into The Elite Grades? Very niche question since I only know of a few climbers posting on here regularly that climb 8b boulders or harder. Feel free to chime in too if you sport climb 8c or if you feel you have any insight from elite climbers that you know.

I’m wondering what you think the major factors were that pushed you passed that point of “very good” to elite.

Living somewhere with a bunch of access to hard climbing?

Climbing with other elite climbers?

Simple consistency over many years?

Obsessive tendencies which prioritized climbing over nearly everything else?

I’m wondering if you remember your mindset and life circumstances when you leveled up and what stands out to you as most significant.

As someone who has been stuck in the “very good” range for many years I think about this often. I don’t live near any established boulders that are above my pay grade. I do get outside as often as possible to practice my craft, and I do get to go on a few trips a year. Usually about a week, but this year I’m lucky enough to be going on a month long trip. I’ve climbed enough problems in my current range that I really don’t mind spending my trips just projecting. With this in mind would you go out and try a bunch of different problems to see what feels like it could go during the trip? Or try to find something before you go that inspires you that you could train for specifically? Seek out the elite people in the area and tag along so I have someone to work problems with even if it wasn’t what I was expecting to try?

Any thoughts appreciated, thanks for your time.
Projecting tactics for a mental crux? On my most recent project, I’ve realized that the crux (for me) is more mental than physical. At the end of a ~3 bolt crux sequence (where the hardest move is at the beginning, but the climbing remains sustained) there is a sequence that goes just a bit higher above the previous bolt than is within my comfort zone, especially given that the feet are small and the moves are delicate and somewhat insecure. I’ve climbed through this section a few times now and know that I can do it. But on my send attempt, when I got there a bit pumped and frazzled, I just didn’t have the confidence to continue on.

I’m hoping to get advice on how I can project this route in a way that builds confidence and ends with me sending in a way where I feel flowy, confident, and not too scared. From a physical stand point, I know if I push through this fear I could send the route. But I don’t want to just push through - I’ve done this in the past and it’s lead to me walking away from a climb glad I did it but never wanting to do it again. I’m willing to spend more attempts than “needed” to send this route in a way that feels good. But I’m not sure what my next few sessions on this route should look like, with this goal in mind?

Hoping to hear from anyone who has gone through a similar experience of projecting a mental crux! I should add, the fall is definitely perfectly safe (no ledges, etc)
Finished a short training cycle as a beginner and would appreciate some advice About me: 36M, 1m70 60kg, never really did sports in my life, climbing for 1.5 year, comfort grade 1Kyu-4Kyu depending on the gym.

Background: I started indoor bouldering more than a year ago, like it very much etc, anyway at the beginning of this year I got fatigued of constantly going to different gyms to try new walls, and also it became apparent to me that even with the best technique, being comfortable in the next grade (3k) at the hard gym would require more physical strength that I have now \[i.e. due to lack of strength the climbing becomes instantly "dirty" and rushed, even at full rest\]. So I bought a pull-up stand and something to hold and got a random training plan which was too random and didn't work for me, so I made my own plan. Originally I thought of just pull-ups + hangs, but I realized I wanted to first get overall fit and get a nice stable base, then train more seriously from there.

My results are roughly as follow (tuned a bit after 2 weeks), training 2 times a week for 4 weeks, with the schedule rest/train/rest/train/rest/rest/climb

&#x200B;

||1st session|8th session|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Pull ups (bw)|5x1|3x6|
|Hangs (bw half crimp 20mm)|2x6s|5x12s|
|Pistol squats|3x2|3x6|
|Push-ups|3x8 normal|3x8 pseudo planche|
|Inverted Row|3x8 normal|3x7 raised legs|
|Plank|30s normal|roughly 3x30s normal, side & back|

&#x200B;

Strengths: the 3kyuu I can send are mostly crimps on vertical wall, slab, things that require precise footwork.

Weaknesses: by far, anything open hand. Out of 34 4kyuu, there are 6 I haven't send yet and they are all based on slopers or big holds requiring open hand crimp or palm grip. Even seeing such holds on an easier grade is enough to worry me.

I would appreciate any feedback e.g. if there are exercises to drop or replace, some advice or anything. In particular I will switch from training from half-crimp to 3-finger drag with the hopes it helps my open hand weakness, such grip just feel extremely awkward to me. I don't think I can even hand 15s on a big crimp with 3 fingers.


Edit: sorry I didn't make this clear but I've been climbing 2-3 times a week since I started, I only changed my schedule to be able to focus on strength for a while. I never did hangs before and 20mm is pretty small for me, so I didn't want to get injured due to overuse or making some bad move due to being tired.

If you can't make that time you can ask questions here so we can post them over. 

Side note: if you want other pro climbers to do AMAs ask them and if they accept send me a date that they want to do it so we can do an announcement.
Strength through full ROM 1:50 - 2:49 in the video, Nalle climbs 'Wheel Of Chaos' V14. Something that struck me when watching him climb this is that he looked like he could 3 second freeze any position at any time during almost the entire climb, especially the upper part. He climbs with such insane tension and it's really mind boggling how he and so many pros are so insanely strong through the entire range of motion used when climbing.

So what do you make of this? And what does it mean for your own training? I think the obvious one is form above all else when training. I've heard from several sources, the book 'Beastmaking' among them, that building strength (at least in isometrics) only applies to the position that you are training the muscle in, with a 15° wiggle room. Correct me if I'm wrong now, all the physios and nerds out there. But this means that if you are training 90° lock offs, you are are getting strong in arm positions when your arm is at an angle anywhere from 82.5° - 97.5°. This is not a huge window, so many people object to training lock offs in this way unless you are training very specifically for a climb or targeting a weakness in that exact position.

So in order to develop this type of strength through the entire ROM tested by climbing, I've thought of a few ways we might go about doing this and a few things to avoid! If you wanna add or remove some exercises, please write a comment, I'd love to know how all of you go about training this type of strength!

- A common mistake that is easy to avoid is not training the weighted pull-up at full range of motion. Curb the ego, lower the weight, go for chest to bar and really squeeze at the end. Maybe even add a pause at the end and go for clean reps, then count set as finished when form degrades.

- Another common mistake is letting the index finger drop into a dragged position when training the half crimp on a hangboard. Keep the index 90° if that is the position you want to train in and end the set if it starts to drop. If you wanna train the chiseled grip (index and pinky open, middle and ring and 90° ish) then do that separately. Also pay close attention to what direction your index finger starts to lean into in the half crimp. If your index finger leans towards the middle finger, usually you start to use back three more than front three. If you have a slight separation between the index and middle finger, this targets front three more. Be specific with what grip you want to train, subtle differences can have a big effect.

- Three second freezes. Classic exercise for building body tension! Hover above each hand hold and freeze for 3 seconds before grabbing it. This is easily scaleable to your climbing level by adjusting wall angle and grade of the climb. This really ticks the specificity box. This might be preferable to normal lock off training unless you are training for something specific. Since you are freezing at different arm angle every time, you will most likely hit most angles if you choose a few different climbs.

- Deadstops. I've seen this mentioned before on this sub reddit and it's great, so I'd like to mention it again. When deadpointing, charge towards the next hold, tense up really hard and slow down right before grabbing it and land as smoothly as you can. I've heard people refer to this as 'Soft Hands' aswell, I believe? It's a great exercise to develop strength and control at that end range of motion. 

- Perfect repeats. Performing perfect repeats on boulders that you found challenging to begin with. Specifically it will help you learn the right timing and intensity of applying pressure to your points of contact to the wall to make the moves as easy as possible. Eventually you might be able to perform Deadstops on almost every move and make it look effortless and perfectly controlled.


I think these exercises might be effective and good for building the climbing specific strength I'm referring to. The biggest challenge when building this type of strength seems to be elbow tendonitis, so I chose exercises that have some variety to them and load the elbows slightly differently every time. Any tips to avoid elbow tendonitis is also very welcome!

I'm aware that I've slightly neglected the lower body aspect that creates this kind of body tension and strength, so if someone wants to add to that, please do! Foot pressure cannot be understated, the more you pressure the feet, the less you have to pull with your arms. Anything that helps increase foot pressure will very likely help your climbing greatly. At the very least, it can't hurt!


A few honorable mentions aswell:
- Building tension in extension moves on a spray wall
- Boulder campusing
- Assisted one arm pull-ups
- Inverted rows/tucked lever rows
Just for fun: send-index is like h-index for ticks! There's a nice metric in academic publishing called h-index that represents a combination of quality and quantity of an individual's contributions. An h-index of *x* indicates that an author has published at least *x* papers, each of which have *x* or more citations.

I had the idea to adapt the concept as "send-index." A send-index of *x* means that a climber has redpointed at least *x* climbs, each graded *x* or harder. To map route grades onto whole numbers, I arbitrarily chose {5.11a => 1, 5.11b => 2, ..., 5.15d => 20}. For boulders I set {V1 => 1, V2 => 2, ..., V17 => 17}.

Here are [several example leaderboards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTfrDtG7AwYq5shC6iv9cZtdsIAWV6VZhBqja7-0IfjIuaHM2xAr6zDshLqkBk6QnBS1_n7RLDSPujW/pubhtml) for sport climbers & climbs by state. In Oregon, even though Ryan had the highest-graded send in the state dataset, his Oregon send-index of 9 (13a) came in below the highest score of 11 (13c) due to lower volume.

Let me know if folks would be interested in the nationwide leaderboards or the ones for other states and boulders. I can also generate per-crag leaderboards if there's interest.
Movement Analysis Through my previous 1-2 haphazard training cycles, my takeaways were that strength was not my low hanging fruit - correct me if you think I am wrong. I am not the strongest (I can't one arm hang any small edges or one arm pull up), but my general finger and pull strength put me around the grades I climb if not higher (in reference to the Power Company data). I have not compared with Lattice data and I am aware to take all of that with a big ole grain of salt.

With that, I had been thinking about seeking out some technical coaching to get some quality movement analysis and see how I can make my climbing more efficient. Due to a wild last half year (family emergencies, baby, minor injuries), that did not happen. I have been listening to a lot of Test Piece podcast recently and really respect their coaching philosophy and styles. Unfortunately they are all booked up, not to mention fairly expensive. So I figured I would resort back to my favorite subreddit and get whatever advice I could here.

**Personal/Climbing History:**

* Male, 33 - 5'8" - 145lbs
* climbing almost 10 years - off and on - mostly on
* only started training more seriously this last year or so - did a cookie cutter plan (Power Company Boulder Better/Strength)
* Gym grades: V6/7 onsight, V8/9 short term project
* Outside grade: several V6, a few V7 and few V8 (i haven't gotten outside consistently in over 2 years)
* I came into climbing fairly strong/athletic so I am not sure if that has been a disservice to my technical development
* I typically climb with people who climb lower grades than me

**Strength Data:**

* 20mm max hangs \~ +45lbs (though I found this is not strict HC - more like full crimp)
* Max push ups: 35
* Max pull ups: 21
* 1RM weighted pull up: +80lbs

**Videos of climbing:**

* [Onsight level gym climb](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/KVj3LuzuJnw)
* ["Sloppy" Mini gym Project](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xNi8NpKlweU) (sent second session - not happy with how it felt)
* [Gym mini project crux working](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o97sqpCV_ZM) (1st and only session so far)
* [Another project sequence working example](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ia6DjaDtZUo) and [the send](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lGqGT5tOL84) (\~4-5 sessions)

I have lots of videos of my climbing on that youtube channel. If you are curious about any grades, angles, or specifics of a specific climb just let me know. Any and all feedback is much appreciated. I am not sure how easy it is to analyze movement from video footage and without knowing angles/holds but I am open to it all.

With all that said, I am planning on focusing on building up my strict half crimp since I realized it is way weak. Please let me know if you honestly think my fingers are holding me back. I tend to lean towards maybe a little but not mainly since I climb all sorts of styles and do not succeed way more easily in crimp vs compression, etc.

TLDR: watch me climb and tell me how much I suck and how I can do better. Thanks.
An alternative data based analysis of the importance of max hangs Hello all.

This morning I saw the post 'are max hangs all they are cracked up to be' with analysis of the power companies climbing dataset. I realised I had previously messaged someone on insta and received a copy of the same dataset. As a bit of fun, a few months ago, I had done an analysis of some of the data as predictive modelling practice.

I concluded very differently than the author of the previous analysis blog posted.

I found that max hangs when adjusted for climber weight (producing a max hang to bodyweight ratio) were by far the most impactful feature.

This was followed by pull ups adjusted for bodyweight and then years climbing and days outside.

Please have a look and feel free to tear my analysis to shreds. I think there are some graphs that anyone should be able to understand.
Technique help - Sloper traverse Fell of the last hard move of low tide, v6. Slopers aren't my style or strength, and would love any technique tips!

Background: I have done ~5 v6 crimp lines outside, but no sloper lines above v5. The two hardest moves, for me, are putting the first left heel up, and going out right hand to the first compression. I fell as I was totally pumped. Sport grade is 2x12b, but on short crimp lines. This is the end of my 3rd session on this boulder.

Self analysis: I hesitated halfway through, almost bumped left instead of right. Where I fell, perhaps a heel instead of a high toe would work better, but usually high toes aren't a problem for me in terms of mobility, even though high heels often are. Lastly, I think I need to drill pointing my toe in heel hooks to help increase engagement.

My bench, pull up, and deadlift numbers are plenty good enough for this, imo (205lbs, +100lbs, 405lbs).

I will definitely train sloper endurance and 3fd strength before I go back in a month. As mentioned, technique tips I could drill would be very appreciated!

I can answer specific microbeta/other questions as you can't see everything in the video.

ClimbingNotebook May Update Hey all, I received a ton of great feedback from the last post and have been working this past month on implementing requests and planned features. The site has gotten to a pretty cool state so I thought I'd share a quick update.

In case you missed the previous post, this website aims to make it easier for climbers to design training programs, track training/climbing data and graph the data to observe patterns or progress.

It is free.

Here's what's new.

# Share Training Programs

You can now share your training programs and duplicate other peoples programs. Here's one of mine just as an example. It is very specific to my weaknesses, as most programs are, so I wouldn't recommend duplicating it. I see this more as a step towards using this as a platform for coaching.

[https://climbingnotebook.com/trainingProgram/1](https://climbingnotebook.com/trainingProgram/1)

# Queries

I'm super excited about this section.

A new query builder has been added that gives you direct access to your data. You can build queries based on a list of conditions. This was specifically created to allow for more complex charts which you will see below.

[An example query of all climbing exercise events](https://preview.redd.it/wwp8wi1obm2b1.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ad1d0139496e4d6b4a4c218645d526683c457b00)

# Widgets

The dashboard system has been completely reworked to use "widgets" rather than just a list of charts. Here are the types of widgets.

**Calendar**

The calendar will automatically show your journal entries and allow you to log events like injuries or trips.

[Journal entries in blue, trips in green, injuries in red \(latter two are customizable\)](https://preview.redd.it/ottiyqlrcm2b1.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=637f222a2325a767ed70dbd615af1da700af9ced)

**Charts**

Charts allow you to build datasets that use queries to graph your data based on an equation. Here you can see an example where I chart my days climbing as well as track an injury. All charts support multiple datasets being displayed in different colors.

[Consistency tracker on left, bar chart on right. Line charts also available](https://preview.redd.it/51vy1jbfcm2b1.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7fce95a78b95f6ea9f58cda003c514d15b42b948)

**Daily Exercise Tracker**

Select a specific training program to track on your dashboard for daily activities. I use this to keep me on track with PT.

&#x200B;

# Nicer weekly exercise planner

The old one was shit, this one is nice.

&#x200B;

# Stability

The site was down a lot last month. For those interested it was mostly due to some really weird issues related to running on an ARM server. I've moved to Intel and it seems to be much more stable. Very weird...still don't really know what was going on lol but sorry for the down time

# Update on going open source

I've decided to keep CN closed for now. This project is still very young and I am still new to the framework (Sveltekit) which means I still occasionally perform refactors that touch tons of files. I think it would be a bad idea to try to bring anyone else onto the code base right now, but hopefully that will be an option down the line when it's a bit more mature :)

# Thanks

That's all for the update. Again, let me know if you have any suggestions or feedback. Been super fun working on this! Hope it helps.

Best off-wall exercises for climbing specific strength Mostly opening this up as a discussion for what people believe has advanced their climbing the most in terms of the off-wall climbing elements.

My main tokens for the debate on what seem most useful:

- Weighted pullups: use a lot of the upper body muscle groups, seem pretty effective but less so at any locking positional type of climbing specific movements.

- Hammer curls: stealing from Drew on this one; very specifically active your brachial muscles which as a more minor muscle group mean there are immediate gains to be had

- Any major antagonist group: I came from a benchpress background before climbing so don't need to train them now other than for some
 maintenance but definitely help to stabilise moves

- Core: I find offwall core using general exercises a lot less effective than active activation on a board, but do enjoy superman holds for top end maximal effort on the core, as well as 90 degree plate holds against a wall

- Grip: fingerboards or lifting edges, but with active grip, so focus on form and an engaged flexion in the pinky translates best to edges you find on harder climbs

- Banded rotations: great for strengthening the shoulder socket through a range of motion, have torn a rotator cuff before and have had no shoulder issues since using these.

-Weighted scapula holds: scapula is pretty integral in stabilising most upper body intensive positions, I find these to be more effective than pullups when you get to a high rep range

-Weighted hip flexor lunges: lower body strength tends to be neglected, strong legs and the ability to pull through your toe easily feels integral

Keen to hear more, have about 12 years of gym and 9 years of climbing so have tried a lot over the years so will reply on my experience to exercises if I have it!
How to figure out why I can’t send a sport climbing route? I used to mostly boulder but I’ve been trying to switch over to sport climbing this year.

With bouldering, when projecting a problem, usually there was one or two moves that I would get stuck on. I’d try out a bunch of different beta, eventually something would click, I’d get past the move I was stuck on and the problem would go.

However with sport climbing, I don’t typically get stuck on a sequence or a move. I just get pumped out to the point that I can’t continue climbing and fall off the wall. Unlike bouldering, I can’t pinpoint my failure to something specific, so I’m often lost on what I need to work on to be able to send the route.

I’ve tried:

- Working on endurance by doing laps of routes
- Made a conscious effort to climb more than “efficiently”

But none of these are specific to any one route. If I fail to send a route because of getting pumped out, I’m typically lost as to what to do other than just trying the route over and over again, trying to climb it more efficiently to reduce the pump.

How do I pinpoint what I need to change or fix to send a specific sport route?
When is it time to stop "just climbing" and actually start training? I've listened to the advice to 'just climb' but now I think it's maybe about time to start actually training to get better. I climb 2 or 3 times a week. I try to eat well, get good sleep, stay hydrated, etc.

I've been bouldering for about a year. I can usually flash V4. I can usually send V5 after 1-5 tries. Sometimes I can send a V6 in a single session, but usually needs to be after a few sessions, if at all. I have never climbed a V7, although I've gotten close a few times. 

I'm about 6'1 with long arms and relatively muscular, almost able to do a 1 arm pullup. I feel like I am using sub-optimal technique and am just brute forcing some climbs, which is why I'm not sure if it's actually time to start hangboarding/flexibility training, or if my time is still better spent honing in technique. I feel like I would benefit from more finger strength, more endurance, and extra flexibility.

In terms of actually training, what will give the best returns on time investment? Hangboarding? Flexibility routine? Core strengthening? Something else? Or just keep climbing?

EDIT: Thank you for all the responses!

It sounds like the answer is more nuanced than "just climb". Climb, but with the intention to focus on your weaknesses. My weakness is using strength, length, and dynos to get through problems instead of using "good" technique.

I went climbing today and made a solid effort to follow the "intended beta" without over-reaching/skipping holds/dynoing unnecessarily. Also made an effort to think about my muscle groups, hips, body position, and making things look "pretty" :)


This thread helped me understand a reason why I might not want to start hangboarding right away. The worry is that if I start training hangboarding, that it would just allow me to keep "brute forcing" things for another grade or two while delaying my technique progress, which is what will actually help me progress in the long term.

I think I will start a flexibility routine because I believe it truly is holding me back, and may be limiting my technique, but I think I will wait on hangboarding for a few more months.


Edit2: Just climbed my first V7 :)
*** Foot Pump While Climbing - Especially Trad Style Routes *** I experience debilitating foot pump on routes that force you to climb slowly, and spend some time pressing hard into your toes. I often find my self cruxxing out near the top of Trad climbs because my feet are so insanely pumped that I resort to resting on my hands more. My movement planning also becomes paniced as I try to escape pumpy foot positions quickly, and am afraid to climb into cruxes with my pumped feet. This is especially hard to deal with on hard alpine climbing days, when the altitude is already causing some water retention/bloat and the days are long and arduous.

I am 5'8'', 200lbs male. I'm heavy for a climber but only have about 18% body fat. I'm relatively fit and could run a 5k without issue. I have extremely wide, troll like feet which may be part of my issue. I've been climbing 7 years and have redpointed up to 5.11d on gear and 12b on sport outdoors. I've also done several alpine routes including the Casual Route on the Diamond, Epinephrine in Red Rocks, etc.

I wear stiff TC pros that aren't insanely tight. Could easily get them on with socks if I wanted. I have tried wearing them loose. Soft shoes seem to be marginally worse on long routes, but not much to be honest.

I recently started walking on a steep treadmill and scrunching my toes to recreate the pumpy feeling. It's not nearly as intense but feels similar. I'll report back on whether this is effective training.

Does anyone else experience this? I can't find much info online. Any help is appreciated.
Fuckarounditis I’m pretty guilty of it especially w regards to climbing. Coming from a background of lifting progressing was much easier for the fact that it was very structured and mostly linear in terms of progression, just add more weight or more sets or change rest etc. however it’s been 2 ish years of consistent climbing and I’ve caught the bug once more. I’d like to keep progressing but with something so non linear like climbing it’s hard for me to quantify progress or even feel like I’m progressing much at all. 

Average day at the climbing gym is go in warmup and then just throw myself at some random boulders/lead routes w no structure, that or on a board. I think projecting for longer would do me good but at the same time my attention span is short and I find it hard to focus myself on to one route/problem for more than a session or two. Routes always feel too easy or too hard or probably doable but I don’t know how to do them. I’d like some more structure to my sessions cause as it stands right now most of the time in the gym I probably in total climb maybe 1 or 2 routes/problems to totality and the rest of my time just mess about

I don’t have enough experience either to analyze my climbs and be able to tell why I’ve fallen off or being able to pick up the minutia other than “I’m too weak”
Technique critique Just looking for some feedback on my technique. Bonus points for spots where I cut and fall. Some things I noticed are that I have a tendency to climb with bent arms. I feel like I’m pushing pretty hard through my feet but this is something I could always improve on. I think on the back flag especially there wasn’t enough weight on my foot. Back flags are a technique weakness for me so lmk if you have any mental cues or drills for them. 

Some background on the climb: this is a V6 on the 60 degree wall from a recent comp at my gym. This is my third red point attempt after a little iso beta work. Which considering the only V6 I’ve done so far at my gym took a month of focused projecting, I’m pretty happy about this go. Was too shot after this attempt to even get the first move, which in iso is the most strenuous one. I think on some sets this would have been a V5 so it feels pretty soft, but I’ll take the ego boost lol. Also definitely suits my strengths. Big moves and big holds with some fancy footwork.

Thanks in advance for any feedback!
Training Plan with Crimpd+ Hey Folks,

anyone got experience with the crimpd+ skill templates? I already got training expirience (3-4 Years?) and currently sitting around \~7c/+ Boulder Outdoors. Fingerstrength is around \~177% 2 Arms on the Lattice Rung (not important, just wanted to brag about my strength...ant he lack of skill to use that ;) ).

I once did a RPTM Plan, and after that a Lattice Plan and after that alternated my Lattice Plan, mixed exercises, did loose planes by how i feel. Right now, i would like to mix things up and try a different structure. Looked in the Bouldering 101 which i liked, but didn't fit my need, Lattice got a bit pricey with €170 (love ya Lattice, got the triple rung, lifting ping, protable hangboard, micros etc), Climb-Strong is not practicable and doesn't have much for Bouldering and what not.

I am currently looking to try, at least the basics structure of one of the Crimpd+ or a Power Company Proven Plan? Can't find Reviews or opinions on these. I got knowledge to change stuff, but i feel like it's time for a bigger change, than i can commit to by my own.  


/Edit

Well, okey, didn't expect \~V10 to be to low for a structured training plan, especially around training enthusiasts. I appreciate the effort in looking for other problems in my climbing, rather than training. Maybe i should i have asked only for a review, or went down the rabbit hole and wrote a long text about my history and what i think are my biggest weaknesses.   
Strength is not my biggest weakness, neither Finger, nor Muscle, and also not flexibility. To be honest, i went to deep into the "don't overpower" end, that i forgot how to turn the Beastmode on and worked so long on my weaknesses and anti style, that i forgot how to project. (my longest project is like 3 Days) 

I got 2 Goals this year: - TRY HARDER, - learn to project. I do this in different ways, which i think ain't important here, unless you're curious? Skill Drills are already a staple of my climbing training with different resources.   


Anyway, i just wanted to know if anyone tried Crimpd+ or a proven Plan, because i wanted to mix a specific Part of my training. Thanks anyway for the effort.
Training to improve work capacity on a project I have a project that is rather anti-style for me. I generally feel at home on slabs and vertical tic-tac crimping; my current project is jug pulling up a 30° overhanging prow. It breaks down as follows:

* about ten steep but easy moves to the second bolt

* a harder sequence, about five bigger moves on poorer holds, to the third bolt

* third bolt is strenuous to clip

* ... and leads with a quick chalk & shake out straight into the technical crux, which is pulling over into the vertical with a long reach to a pocket. The pocket is mediocre, but if I hit it I'm unlikely to fall off

* followed by a few metres of easy vert to the chains

* my current beta for the crux is low percentage - succeeds about every third or fourth go - but I may have found a more reliable sequence at the weekend

What I'm asking about here isn't so much the route - I've one-hanged it multiple times, still finding beta refinements but I'm confident that i can do it in principle.

The problem is that I only manage two credible goes a day. Third go I rarely even make it to the hard clip at the third - which is slightly scary to arrive at totally out of gas, since the fall is still quite close to the ground at that point. 

So tl/dr: how to improve work capacity - credible goes per day - on a short, steep power endurance route?
Sanity check for a demoralized newbie: am I a slow responder, impatient, or training wrong? Hey everyone, hopefully this doesn't sound too cliche (new climber complains about not enough finger strength, what's new). I've officially hit a year of bouldering, extremely consistently indoors 3 times per week for 2.5-3 hour sessions, and my progression of strength has really confused me. I came in with an athletic background and calisthenics training, could pull just under 150% BW for one rep. It took me about three to four months to climb some juggy indoor v4s consistently, with some gimmicky v5/v6s thrown in (dyno, coordination, one move wonders). In those three to four months, I didn't really do any other training, but my pulling strength exploded: I tried a one arm pullup and one arm chinup one day and found myself doing it out of nowhere; I was able to front lever for 3-5 seconds when I struggled with a tuck front lever before climbing; and I could now do 30 clean pullups, whereas before I maxed out at 16. However, I noticed that my finger strength was still relatively weak and I was especially weak on crimps: on v3 crimp problems (vertical climbs that were extremely straightforward but with 1.25 pad holds) I was often shut down. I couldn't hang bodyweight on a 20 mm edge; in fact, even hanging bodyweight on a large campus rung (\~32 mm) I could only hang for about 7-10 seconds max.

I made a post here for advice on how to close the gap between body and finger strength and the message was basically to start focusing more on crimps and try low frequency and intensity hangboarding if I felt like I could handle the volume. For the last 5-6 months, I've been doing exactly that: dropping my ego and working on v2 to v3 crimpy problems which would become multi-session projects. The people I climb with, who started around the same time as me +- a couple months, were flashing these problems or even using them as warmups or for eliminates (they are comfortably climbing v5/v6 now). I continued to tell myself to be patient, that fingers take longer to train than other muscle groups, and that by just climbing, I was improving my finger strength and technique and this would pay dividends later when my fingers were at the level that I could leverage my pulling power on hard climbs. I also did about 1 light hanging session a week, usually on a campus rung where I would either no hang on a smaller rung or hang bodyweight on a medium rung.

However, very recently I came home to boulder with a friend that I began my climbing journey with (I had moved away after a month for a job and continued bouldering there). My friend had also continued climbing, but less serious than me, with month-long breaks in between and closer to 1-2 times per week. We both concluded I had probably put in more than twice as much time in as my friend had, and my friend rarely climbed crimps and never did any directed finger training; I have always also been thinner (5'9'' at 135ish lbs). When we climbed together, we could see the difference in the movement on the wall: I had better footwork and technique, understanding of body positioning, and route reading, but once we figured out the actual moves, it seemed that there was no difference between the moves that we both could or couldn't do in terms of holding onto the wall. We were curious to see our difference in finger strength so we decided to test it with simple body weight hangs on a hangboard (he had never used it and didn't even know what a half crimp was so I had to teach him). I still couldn't come close to hanging on a 20 mm edge, and could hang for about 3-5 seconds on a 25 mm campus rung body weight. My friend could hang for 5-7 seconds on a 20 mm edge, and 3-5 seconds on a 19 mm campus rung body weight.

We were both shocked at the results, and I'm more than a little dismayed. My finger strength hasn't had absolutely zero progression in the last six months and I'm sending those v2-v3 climbs after multiple sessions, which is great, but in the context of everyone I've climbed with, it seems I'm putting in so much effort for very little results. On top of that, my climbing sessions have also been pretty frustrating and not fun, as the climbs I'm doing are really not very complex or interesting, and yet I'm still falling repeatedly because literally 1% of my body is not strong enough to do the climb. People tell me I'm strong, I feel strong, but on the wall, I just feel so weak and it leaves me so disappointed. A lot of what I enjoy about climbing is the engagement of your full body and the sensation of floating and control, and I leave each session frustrated at the lack of this feeling, and also annoyed at myself for even feeling frustrated--I realize I'm a new climber, being weak is normal, and I might be taking things too seriously, but I can't seem to help it. I also can't escape the nagging feeling that things will just get slower, as strength gains are generally fastest at the beginning, and then tail off over time. If I am just really genetically poor in the fingers, I don't know how long I can just continue to be frustrated in the hopes that one day it all pays off. It's honestly made me question my future in the sport, even though I love the idea of it so much. 

Sorry for the long post, but this has been weighing on my mind for quite a while. Am I just training wrong, is everyone around me just coincidentally super good and I'm impatient, or am I just doomed to lagging finger strength because of genetics? Maybe some combination of all three? I would appreciate all perspective you might have, whether it's training-related or mental-related, as honestly both seem to need assistance at this point!
Finger strength improvements when not climbing Hi All,
I recently had a hip operation and obviously cannot climb. I'm a lowly V5/5.11 climber. I was very much afraid that I'd lose finger strength during my 3-month period of surgery recovery. So, I started using Tension block with 20 mm edge to keep fingers engaged. To my surprise, i actually started getting some gains. While it is unclear if those gains will transfer to the climbing wall, i am still quite surprised.
I've been following Yves Grivelle's method of reps, but instead of using fixed weights I pull on the tension block which is attached to my healthy foot. I use Tindeq strain gauge to measure force. The sets and reps look like this (example below is for current half crimp, kg values are the peak force values I aim for):

1. 50% x8 (L: 27 kg, R: 29 kg)
2. 60% x8 (L: 32 kg, R: 34 kg)
3. 70% x8 (L: 37 kg, R: 40 kg)
4. 80% x4 (L: 42.5 kg, R: 46 kg)
5. 80% x4
6. 80% x4
7. 80% x4

When I tested I got the following values of peak force:

- right half crimp: 46 kg to 57 kg (in 4 weeks)
- left half crimp: 40 kg to 53 kg (in 4 weeks)
- right 3 finger drag: 41 kg to 47 kg
- left 3 finger drag: 37 kg to 43 kg

I do these exercises every day. This means that on one day I do half crimp and the day after I do 3 finger drag. The total volume is low, because I do not do any climbing now. 
I realise that these numbers are specific to Tension block and who knows if they will transfer to climbing. Still, I find it interesting that with such a low overall volume i do see improvement. Well, maybe this observation confirms what some folks say: that in order to get stronger the volume has to go down?Just wanted to share this experience.
Cheers
Good technique is ___ . 1. **Good technique is finding the path of least resistance.** If you can go dynamic and skip two moves, why not do so? If using a heel hook puts you in a better position for the next move than using your toe, you should probably use the heel.

2. **Good technique is about directing all of your energy into making the moves.** Excessive readjusting on holds, sloppy foot placement, and improper body positioning wastes energy, and makes moves harder. Good technique is about making the moves as easy as possible, and moving so that your energy is directed into these moves.

3. **Good technique is understanding how your body fits in space.** Am I moving along the correct trajectory to the next hold? Is my body starting in a position of power, and ending in a spot of stability? If your hips are outside the box, you're gonna waste energy. If you waste energy, your changes of sticking the crux later on goes down. See (2).

4. **Good technique is about you.** Good technique is different for the 5 foot vs the 6 foot climber. Everyone has a different body and different strengths. Climb to stack the odds in *your* favor. Good technique is what gets *you* to the top of the wall.
Disparity between different grip types Background: I used to subconsciously full crimp all the time, which was not great for my fingers; it caused them to be inflamed and very stiff (synovitis). After a few months of rehab and using different grips, my fingers now feel healthier and stronger than ever. My strongest grip is half crimp (bw + 40% at 20mm edge for 7 secs), and I'm currently trying to improve my 3 finger drag.





After avoiding full crimps for so long, I found out that I have trouble even hanging full crimp on a 20mm edge, mainly due to the pain, and it also makes my fingers feel a little stiff afterwards.





I'm wondering if it's worth it to do some exposure therapy for full crimp by doing very light hangboarding with my feet on the ground (similar to Emil's routine). So I will have more tools in the toolbox essentially.





I'm curious to see what you guys think about the usefulness of different grip types for your climbing, e.g. 3 finger drag is more efficient and you get more reach; half crimp is more mechanically strong; etc. Is it ok to just train one grip type or is it better to be well rounded with different grips?
A Guide to Flashing Sport Climbs Flashing a climbing route is when a climber sends a route on their first attempt with prior knowledge about that route. This means that they may know what the holds are like, what moves are the most difficult, where the resting positions are, etc. Flashing is distinct from onsighting, where the climber still sends the route first try, but they have essentially no information about it besides what they are able to gather from simply looking at the route. Despite these disciplines seeming very similar on the surface, they are quite different if approached properly. This is due to the amount of work that can be done before a flash attempt, and how well a route can be learned before ever getting on it. Many climbers just learn a tiny bit about a route before trying to flash it, perhaps reading Mountain Project comments and checking out the pictures. This is a fine approach if you are not very serious about your flash attempt, but there is much more that can be done if you want to tilt the odds in your favor as much as possible. This article will focus on my personal approach to flashing sport climbs that are at the limit of what I am able to do on my first attempt.

**Part 1: Gather Beta**

Once you have chosen a route that you want to flash, the first step is to gather as much beta as you possibly can on it. This is a crucial step, and no stone should be left unturned. If you are going to give your best attempt at a flash go, you must learn everything that you can about the route.

A great first step here is to read about the route in the guidebook, as well as scour the internet for information on the climb. This includes visiting websites such as Mountain Project and 8a.nu, along with any other website that lists the climb. Read the route descriptions, read every single comment, read the ticks for the route (these often include beta), and study every picture that you can find. I will even go so far as to check the Instagram accounts of people who have ticked the route to see if they have any videos of it. You want to gather all of the information that you possibly can. Studying this information will ideally give you quite a bit of knowledge on the route. A non-exhaustive list of things that you should be paying attention to when gathering this information is: 

* how steep the route is 
* how long the route is
* where the cruxes are
* what the cruxes are like
* if it is sustained or not (if not, where are the hardest moves)
* where the rests are
* how good the rests are
* what the holds are like
* when the route is in the sun
* if you will need any special equipment (like a kneebar pad), etc.

Gather as much information as you possibly can, and consider making notes of the most important things that you find.

&#x200B;

Once you have gathered all of this beta, you want to start zeroing in on the finer details. In particular, you need to figure out *exactly* how people are climbing the route — especially the cruxes. If you were able to obtain videos of the route, screen record the videos so that you can watch them in front of the route on the day of the attempt in case there is no service at the crag. Watch these videos over and over, first taking note of the holds that are being used and the general movements that the climbers are doing. As you become more acquainted with the movement of the route, take a closer look. Where *exactly* is that person placing their foot for that move — how far does it seem to be from their hands, does it look like a smear or an edge, do they appear to be getting a lot of weight on it? Get down to as fine of detail as you can. Knowing the dimensions and the climbing styles of the climbers you are getting beta from (whether it be from comments or videos) is also very helpful, as it will give you a more clear picture of moves.

Another great way to get detailed beta is to talk to people who have sent the route. Of course, if you know someone that has done it, that’s wonderful. Gather as much information from them as you can. Ideally, watch videos with them and talk through the moves, or even get out to the cliff to look at the route together. A lot of the time, however, you won’t know someone who has climbed your flash project. If this is the case, reach out to people online who have sent that route. Look at the tick lists on Mountain Project, 8a, and other websites, and send emails to the people who have redpointed the route. Ideally, you want to talk to people who really had to session on it, since they will generally be the ones who know the beta with the most detail. Ask them any questions that you have, be it what certain holds are like, how good a rest is, if there is anything tricky to look out for, etc. Having a written description of how to climb a route along with a video of someone doing it can be very helpful.

Perhaps the best way to get detailed beta on a route is to go out and climb it with someone whose climbing style you know, and who also knows your climbing style. Belay them on the route and have them hang and talk to you about certain holds and sequences. This should give you a very clear picture about what to expect, especially if this climber knows your strengths and weaknesses well. Be sure to take notes (they can just be audio recordings), or videos of your partner explaining the sequences. For the most serious flash attempts, this is a step that you should strongly consider taking up. However if this is not possible, the aforementioned ways of gathering beta will oftentimes be sufficient.

Once you have gathered all of the beta that you can, you want to decide on what sequences you will use in the cruxes. Based on the people that you have talked to, the videos you have seen, and the comments on the route, you should come up with a plan that will best play to your strengths. I generally like to choose one way that I will plan to do each crux, but if there are other betas I still want to memorize those so that I am aware of different opportunities if my chosen beta does not feel like it will work. On less pumpy routes, or routes where you can go feel holds and then down climb to a good rest, you may have more leniency in hanging out and deciding on which beta to use while on route. Generally though, you want to choose one method before getting on the climb and stick with it, with little to no variation. You often don’t have much time to play around with beta on a flash attempt at your limit, so choosing one method and committing to it is typically going to be your best option.

One final consideration is getting beta for sections *besides* the crux(es). This is a personal choice that I think comes down to a few factors, primarily how hard or insecure those sections are. If the easier parts of the climb are still fairly difficult, you are going to want to get beta for those as well. However, if they are easy for you, you may choose not to. The more beta you get, the more you will be climbing from memory as opposed to intuition. This can cause some problems if you are not diligent enough with memorizing these sections. Knowing most of the moves on a section but not knowing all of the sequences perfectly can take you out of intuitive climbing and can increase the risk that you will make a mistake. My general approach is to memorize all sections that are hard, and for sections that are well below your limit, get some information on them (especially any key holds or beta), but don’t worry about trying to memorize the exact sequence. On terrain well below your flash limit, it is better to climb intuitively than to try to follow some beta on the fly that you only kind of remember. For extremely serious flash attempts, you may choose to memorize almost the entire route, but this will be a personal choice based on the individual and the climb.

**Part 2: Visualize**

The visualization process is just as important (if not more so) than the process of gathering beta. This is a step that is often overlooked or underdone, but it is crucial if you want to give yourself the best chance at flashing a route. 

The first step of my visualization process is memorizing the moves. In the beginning, this is more general and it need not involve very fine details. When I do this, I lay down, close my eyes, and imagine that I am watching someone climb the route. It’s almost like I’m replaying one of the videos that I have seen of the route in my head, but with the beta that I intend to use. I can’t produce an actual video-quality image in my mind, but that’s the idea. For me, this process involves many repetitions. I watch the cruxes over and over. As this goes on, you start to get into the more minuscule details of each move. I often am visualizing a sequence and then stop when I realize I’m not entirely sure of something — be it when a foot switch occurs, what part of the hold I should use, etc. When this is the case, I go back and check the videos of the route or the notes I have taken. Then I see how the move is done and I return to visualizing. Most of us will want to do many repetitions of this visualization step  — likely more than you would first deem necessary. As discussed above, having a decent but not great understanding of how to climb the route will not cut it, and it can even hurt your chances. You want to get to a point where you can visualize the crux from start to finish on command, without making any mistakes. This may take a few days of several 10-30 minute visualization sessions per day, possibly more.

The next step is to alter your visualization process to a first-person point of view. This does not have to be entirely separate from the visualization process of “watching” the route be climbed, but I often find that memorizing the moves from a third-person perspective is easier because it is more purely mental, while visualizing from a first-person perspective involves more visceral feelings. Once you have the moves memorized, it’s time to start to feel what it’s like to actually climb the route, to the best of your abilities. This means that you are now visualizing yourself climbing the route, and you are pantomiming the moves while laying on the ground. You want to do your very best to match the timing and the sensations that you will be feeling while climbing. Time your breathing with the moves, get your foot up really high if the move you’re visualizing has a high foot, rotate your body with the moves. Do everything that you can to match your body to the positions that you’ll be in while on the route. The aim here is to go beyond just memorizing the moves — you want to literally feel yourself climbing them. Again, do many repetitions of this process. When you’re actually climbing the route, you want it to feel familiar and you want to be consciously thinking about what move to perform as little as possible. First-person POV visualization helps to engrain the moves into your body and mind, especially if done well and with many repetitions. Perform these visualizations over and over, again over the course of multiple days. 

One thing that I want to note is that most people will feel weird doing first-person POV visualization when starting out. It’s pretty silly — you’re laying on the ground, breathing hard and doing seemingly absurd movements. I suggest doing it alone in a room, perhaps even when no one else is in your house. This will make you as comfortable as possible and will allow you to devote maximum focus to the visualization.

The final step when visualizing is the emotions that you may experience while on the route, especially while in the rests. Oftentimes resting positions are when we can be captured by emotion on a route. While actually climbing, we tend to be so focused on the movement that we’re not actively processing our emotions. However, our minds can become more active while we are in resting positions, and they tend to meta-analyze the process. This is not inherently bad, but it is something that we need to be aware of. You want to ask yourself how you will feel before each crux section. Will you be scared of failing? Scared of falling? How about at the rest before the final easier section. You’re done with all the hard climbing, now you have to just not blow it — how would that make you feel? Consider the above questions well before getting on the route. If you think you may be scared while climbing a certain section, or while in a rest, do your best to feel that fear as you visualize yourself climbing it. 

This may at first sound counterintuitive. You might think that it would be better to visualize yourself as not scared at all — confident and flowing perfectly up the wall. This type of visualization has its place, but you must be realistic with yourself. Do you actually believe that is how you will feel in a certain section? If so, then great. But for most of us, there will be some sort of fear or doubt creeping in when we are trying to flash at our limit. Fear of failure is almost certain to come up at some point during a hard flash attempt. Rather than ignoring this fear, we want to dance with it. If we’re prepared to be scared, fear won’t be such a shock when we’re on route and actually feeling those emotions. When we include emotion into our visualization process, we make the experience more realistic, and we are better able to deal with those emotions when they come up because we’ve imagined feeling them many times over. I have been harping on fear, but there are a number of other emotions that you may feel on route — be sure to consider these as well. Once you have done the previous steps of the visualization process, walk through the entire route in your mind, consider what emotions you are likely to feel in certain spots, and then add those emotions into your first-person visualizations as best as you can. You may not be able to feel the emotions like you would on the wall, but do your best to imagine them and feel those sensations in your body.

Flashing sport climbs is an art. From gathering information, memorizing the beta, visualizing the route, and ultimately executing, there are a number of ways that we can prepare ourselves for a flash. This is something that takes time. I recommend budgeting at least a week for the entire process, putting work in every day leading up to the attempt. In certain instances one may choose to spend more time on prep, depending on the individual, the route, and how important it is to them. Happy sending!
Summer Projects in Fontainebleau Hey 

I‘m in Fontainebleau within a few days and I know this is not the best season for projecting, since it‘s hot and Fontainebleau is full of slopers. Still I want to get on a sweet project to finally break into the 7B/v8 range. So I am looking for a boulder that still can be done under these conditions. I will come back in autumn so there is not a huge
pressure to send it, but would be amazing to make some progress. Maybe you guys have something in mind, that suits my strengths? 

I am bouldering for around 5 years, sometimes go rope climbing and have some outdoor experience (e.g. this will be my third time in font) 
Despite (or thanks to) my height (173cm) I am strong in powerful reachy moves, can do a one arm pull up and have decent grip strength. I am also quite flexi and a sucker for high heels (no pun intended). Usually I favor big holds where i can do dynamic moves on and understand the slopergame quite well (at least in the gym)

My weakness is definetely technical moves on slabs and longer endurance problems.

I appreciate any tips, and maybe some of you guys are there as well so we could hop on something together! 

(I hope that this is the right community to post this in, if not applogies, this is my first post in reddit and I am still figuring out the navigations)
Drew Ruana AMA - Round 2 Hey everyone, back here for round 2 of an AMA!

Quick introduction- I'm a professional rock climber specializing in bouldering. I used to compete in the World Cup circuit but I switched gears to only outdoor bouldering and have found more success there than in competitions. Stats wise I've done around 80 v14s, 30 v15s and 10 v16s in just under 4 years. I've been climbing for almost 20 years, 15 of those have been serious/training oriented. I'm also a full time student at Colorado School of Mines but I've found ways to balance climbing and school life nicely (The last AMA I did convinced me to switch majors and I couldn't be happier 6 months later- thanks reddit!)
How do I build resilient fingers and not constantly feel tweaky Every time I try to punch into the v9-10 range I always get minor injuries and tweaks that hold me back. In particular, my fingers feel tweaky after every boulder session. 

In general, I climb 2-3 times a week (typically separated by 2 days of rest) for roughly 2 hours of limit bouldering. I don’t believe my volume is too much, partially because other climbers in my gym seem to climb 5-6 days a week at limit and not get injured but also that I am quite reserved on crimps meaning I don’t pull as hard as I could. I also rarely full crimp. Another thing to note is that I injured my FDP in both hands  1-2 years ago and stopped 3F dragging entirely (it was intentional at first but accidentally became a chronic habit, one that I am breaking now). I believe this has caused me to have an over reliance on half crimp and that may be contributing to my tweaky feeling. I do also climb 4F open when possible but it isn’t as strong as my half crimp.

For my warm up, I do 1 sub max repeater set of 7-3. I do a very sub max repeater set of 7-3 on each hand and then end with some pulse pulls to fully feel recruited. Then I’d go start at v0-v whatever my project grade is that session. If I’m being honest my on wall warm up is probably 15 minutes more or less. 

No matter how much rest and usually no matter how short the boulder session is, my fingers feel tweaky the next day or two. Tweaky usually means: stiffness, random aches and just a general feeling that my fingers are tired. 

I believe my over reliance on half crimp and probably the fact that I don’t stretch my forearms often may be why I feel so tweaky. 

I recently strained my A2 so I am very determined to solve my tweaky fingers. 

How do train my fingers to simply feel better and adjust to harder climbing?
Improve finger strength without hang-boarding I started bouldering, indoor only, in January and have been hooked ever since - averaging 3 sessions a week 2.5hrs each. Currently climbing V4 consistently, did my first v5 recently, and can flash most V3s.

From what I've read, it's way too early (in terms of time spent climbing and grade) for me to start hangboarding.  However, I've always felt as though finger strength is disproportionately holding me back.  I went outdoor climbing for the first time last weekend and really struggled to sink into the smaller crimped holds.

I think perhaps I have a fairly strong sporting / weightlifting background prior to climbing, so I had a great baseline of strength/flexibility/tension (+ even pinch grip) coming in - and have overcompensated using these at the expense of developing finger strength.

Any advice from climbers with a similar story?  I.e. came in from other sports so have good strength / flexibility etc but relatively very weak fingers.  Did you make an exception to start hang-boarding earlier?  Or did you have other training ideas which helped?
Seeking advice for climbing after partial vision loss and lack of depth perception Hello! A year ago today, my retina randomly detached. It was surgically corrected and my surgeon cleared me to climb.

However, I lost about 25% of my vision in that eye and with contacts, the best is can see out of it is 20/50. 

I can climb fine in the gym because the holds are brightly colored but my real love is for outside routes. I have really been struggling with not being able to differentiate good from bad nubbins and read rock textures appropriately. 

My surgeon and optometrist have no resources for how to help and have told me to go off and find second opinions so I’m going to call around. But they don’t think vision therapy will help.

The best solution I have found is to lead and down climb multiple laps on really easy 5.7 routes to “warm up” my eyes and adjust them to the texture of the rock. The problem is that not every crag has 5.7 climbs to warm up on. 

I’m going to try climbing outside with an eyepatch over my bad eye to see if that helps… maybe seeing clearly out of only one eye is better than seeing out of one good eye and one bad eye.

Would really appreciate advice from vision-impaired climbers, this last year has been brutal on my mental health.
Climbing skill acquisition Hey everyone, 

I'm a neuroscience postdoc and recently I've been becoming increasingly interested in the literature surrounding skill acquisition and expert performance. I have a few ideas swirling in my head relating to developing technical expertise in climbing and whether/how technique can be measured in relatively standardized manner. 

You might already be aware of some literature showing that a minimum of 10 years of experience is required to reach expert-level performance in various domains (e.g. check the review "The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance"). 

Just for fun I created a super short survey (\~1 min), that you can fill out here: [https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/FN6VNFX](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/FN6VNFX) 

P.S\_1: Obviously, this is not meant to be "science" and there are clear caveats, like years of climbing don't correspond to time spent in deliberate practice, grades achieved don't correspond to climbing skill, grades are subjective etc etc.. This is meant to satisfy some of my own curiosity and I can post the results here if people are interested. 

P.S\_2: If you have ideas about quantifying climbing technique, let me know!
Similar Gym/Workout Experience to Climbing Hey all, I've been climbing off and on for about 2 years and absolutely love it. I try and supplement my 2-3 climbing sessions a week with visits to the normal gym, trying to hit muscles I don't normally get as often climbing (legs, cardio, triceps, back). Part of what's kept me into climbing is the really friendly gym environment, gamification of the exercising, and dopamine hits from finishing routes/climbing grades. Recently after stumbling across this subreddit ive payed a little more attention to my routines, and have in general been taking my health and workouts more seriously. 

&#x200B;

Something I've instantly noticed is the stark lack of motivation and drive for my normal gym days compared to going to the climbing gym. Just sitting on the treadmill for 20 minutes or doing one repetitive motion does not engage me in the same way discussing routes and consistently surpassing myself does when im climbing. 

&#x200B;

Im curious if anyone else has been in a similar position and if there are any communities or activities you've found that compare to climbing, but contribute to other aspects of health and exercise. I've looked into signing up for things like 5k's, bootcamps, different types of martial arts, and even personal trainers, but haven't taken the plunge on anything. 

&#x200B;

I know that seriously exercising is an uphill journey, and isn't always pretty or enjoyable, but I figured I'd see if anyone has had the same experience before I either suffer through or start paying out for new membership fees. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: What other activities do you do for exercise that compare to the gym environment and dopamine hits that climbing provides?
Observations after 5 weeks of creatine, antihydral Out of curiosity, I started taking creatine (almost) daily at about 5g. I am 173cm tall and weigh about 69kg, pretty muscular. about 25 days ago I applied antihydral for the first time due to ever increasing problems with sweaty fingers.

&#x200B;

**Creatine:**  
I had read mixed opinions about creatine for climbing purposes, with the potential gains in strength (literally) outweighed by the extra weight, as well as increased pump reported by some.

So far I have not really noticed any weight gain, however, in the same time period I have made changes to my diet with the aim of losing a kilo or two, so I might have achieved that, but gained roughly the same amount in water due to creatine. So far I have not noticed the dreaded pump, although I will need to put that to the test more with some 4x4 exercises. I have definitely noticed an increase in strength, most notably at the bench press where I had a good reference frame. I do feel like some tough burly moves in bouldering come easier as well.

One other thing I was hoping for was better recovery. I have been dealing with some sort of bicep tendonitis for a while. So far I can't report any positive change. I am currently trying to change my training and buldering style to not rely on muscles, and bicep most importantly, as much, and work on flexibility, finger strength and technique more.  


I have more than half of the bag of creatine left, so I will continue using it until that's gone.

&#x200B;

**Antihydral**

Applied it once 25 days ago. I used what I would consider to be small amounts on the four fingers of both hands, excluding my thumbs. I left it on for about 4-5 hours over night before washing it off. I went bouldering approx. 36h later and already there was almost no sweat anymore. Over the next two weeks not much changed except for a bit more tough skin on/around the applied areas to take care of. At maybe 2.5 weeks I felt like the effect started to lessen. Still, today, at 3.5 weeks, it is still not gone fully, but I am definitely getting somewhat sweaty fingertips again. Might reapply tonight.

Now for the interesting part: I exclusively bouldered indoors throughout this period. Obviously antihydral is primarily recommended for outdoor use, but as I do not go outdoors often, I wanted to see if it can improve my indoor performance without me dry-firing off of plastic. I am happy to say that this has not happened. Maybe it was the small amount I used, or the severeness of my sweatiness, but it worked out for me. One reason I desire this is because I want to train crimps as I have avoided them for basically all my climbing years, partially because of not wanting to put too much pressure on sweaty fingertips.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

I will definitely stick to the antihydral. What my routine will look like I have yet to determine. I know that it is unclear how much damage one potentially does by prolonged application, so I will keep that in mind. It is definitely working for me though.   
Creatine is tbd. I think my body might be predisposed to muscle growth a bit too much for my liking, so continued use seems unlikely. Cycling it could be an option, I'll see. I like the strength gains.
How much should I be eating? (how much protein, calories, etc) Hi everyone. I’m really confused on how much I should be eating, mainly around how many calories and how much protein. I’m 17 F, 5’5”, 124 lbs. I’ve been climbing for 2 years and typically climb v6-7 and 5.12-. 

I climb 4 days a week, each session usually about 3 hours: 

2 days are practice days (usually consisting of max hangs, climbing drills, body weight or lifting workouts, endurance climbing, onsights, etc) practice is 2 hours but i usually stay after for about an hour and boulder, do a small workout, and/or run. 

1 day is a strength day (weighted pull ups, lifting, climbing drills)

1 day is a project day (project anything i want and then leg routine after which is barbell squats, deadlifts, hip thrusts) 

If I have time I usually run a mile after my sessions, and then the remaining 3 days of the week are rest days. 

I guess I’m wondering about how much food and specifically how much protein i need to support this activity. I’m looking to obviously get better at climbing and build strength (and preferably lose some fat too). How I eat now is typically a bagel with egg and avocado for brunch, a snack before i leave for the gym (whatever I have in the house), an apple as a snack during my sessions, and then for dinner whatever we have, usually something with meat in it. Sorry if this is vague, but I’m hoping for some direction if anyone has any advice, thanks!
In Feb I started a "Performance" plan with Lattice. I wrote about my experience with the first 12 weeks in my blog. I'm happy to answer questions here and/or take critiques about my writing to improve my post. I hope some find this at least interesting and perhaps helpful.
The most important finger while climbing (TAMY/Tomoa) In this [recent video](https://youtu.be/9mlOlkSo_fw?t=686) from TAMY, Meichi Narasaki asks Tomoa Narasaki, Akiyo Nogychi, and Ikeda Yudai what the most important finger in climbing is.

Captions (\~11:26): 

Meichi: What's the most important finger in climbing?

Akiyo: So, the finger that made an impact when I focused on it, right?

Meichi: **Thumb**

Tomoa: **Thumb**

Akiyo: **Pinky**

Ikedai: **Pinky**

I'm assuming thumb control helped with pinches and pinky control with crimps. Naively, I would've guessed middle finger since that seems to be the strongest. What do you guys think? Has anyone thought very consciously about the role of an individual finger while climbing, and seen improvement as a consequence? Any helpful drills or cues to further activate any given finger?
Smart DIY Fingerboard I'm excited to share with you all a device I built for a research study that measures the force applied while fingerboarding. I though the nerdy among you will appreciate it!
I needed something that was very accurate and with the ability to be calibrated, and most importantly, that would not break the bank as I have a limited budget for the study. In the end I ended up doing it myself and dedicating it way more time than I should but this was the result.
It is compatible with almost any fingerboard, micro edge or regular holds so we can experiment with different types of standard edges or even irregular holds more similar to natural rock holds.
Even though it uses a web interface to be able to use it with both a laptop or a phone it doesn't requiere access to WiFi and best of all, no cable between your laptop or phone. Also, it runs on battery, so no need to find a plug, which I'm sure it'll come in handy when testing in the darkest corner of some gyms!
As you can see, for now it lived in my home hangboard frame (literally built out of the cheapest timber I could find) and has a long cable connected to a big powerbank instead of the internal battery so I don't have to charge it as often.
I'm excited to hear your thoughts and suggestions on this project.
Happy climbing!!
Some thoughts on body tension **All of the exercise names are clickable links**

Wanted to share a few thoughts and exercises to work on body tension.

**The Problem:** Your feet cut during an outstretched move. This could be due to a number of things:

1. Body positioning- the simplest one to fix. Is your body in the correct spot to pull on the hold at the best angle possible? If not, watch other climbers and see what they do differently. Are you too far from the wall? Too close? Are your hips under the holds you're pulling on, and ending up under the holds you're trying to grab during the move? Where are your feet in relation to your body? Are you pushing into the footholds at the best angle?

2. Pulling angle- oftentimes pulling *out* instead of just down can dramatically improve body tension if a hold is positive or incut enough to do so. This allows you to drive into poor footholds better, and suck yourself closer to the wall; see point 1.

3. Posterior chain complex and the hips- we spend a lot of time sitting every day. This leads to weakened hamstrings and glutes, and tight hip flexors and psoas. The hamstrings, glutes, and calves are responsible for much of the work in staying on the wall. Additionally, tight hip flexors and psoas can limit our range of motion with higher feet, and lead to issues with properly weighting footholds. Have you ever seen someone cut feet to bring their foot up because they aren't flexible enough to reach it? Sometimes this *is* necessary but oftentimes we can avoid it.

4. Ankle dorsiflexion: On poor footholds, keeping the heel low can improve the angle we apply force into the hold. This requires a base level of ankle (and hip) flexibility to achieve. Limited ankle dorsiflexion range means our foot can't apply pressure at the best angle- causing it to pop off the foothold.

5. Finger strength- if our fingers aren't strong enough for a given move, we often compensate by raising the elbow and engaging the shoulder and bicep. This pulls our body, and thus our hips- upwards and off of the footholds we're trying to stay on. Sometimes getting stronger simply *is* the answer to better technique (if we wanna lump body tension into this term).

6. Shoulder and rotator cuff strength- The rotator cuff and scapula are critical for pulling (and holding) our body into the wall. Weak rotator cuffs means the upper body can sag away from the wall, and often the hips follow closely behind, dragging our feet away with them.

7. Anterior core and obliques- this is the one people immediately think of when it comes to body tension, and it does play a role. For most people however, I believe body tension issues arise from the first four points. The "core" muscles (side note, I'd argue that all of the muscles discussed so far should be considered part of the core) help stabilize your torso and hips while moving, playing a similar stabilization role to the shoulders.

**Assorted Exercises**

**[Copenhagen Plank:](https://www.shape.com/copenhagen-plank-6823056)** Credits to lattice for this hidden gem, great for holding tension on feet that are far to the side. As a progression, you can put on your climbing shoes and do this with your foot on a small foothold to practice driving into bad feet in this position.

**For the posterior chain and hips:** [(exercise about three and a half minutes in.)](https://youtu.be/H57_T0Sv7rA) I don't really know what to call this, but it's incredibly helpful. Strengthens the adductors and hamstrings while releasing tight hip flexors.

**[Cuban Press:](https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/cuban-press)** start out VERY light with this one. This will strengthen the rotator cuff and surrounding shoulder stability muscle groups. This can help with pulling ourselves into the wall, as in point 2.

**[Face pulls:](https://youtu.be/eIq5CB9JfKE)** done correctly, also great for the rotator cuffs and upper back.

**[Lu Raises:](https://youtu.be/FfDy-4HN_PU)** this is also good for shoulder mobility and rotator cuff strength. Start with 2.5-5lbs plates and progress slowly.

**[Deadlifts and variations thereof:](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/fitness/a748582/how-to-deadlift/)** This is a great all around posterior chain builder. Stiff leg and Romanian variations are especially great as they emphasize the hamstrings and glutes. One legged variations with dumbbells are fun to explore as well, and are a nice way to work on balance during your warmup/cooldowns.
Best thing I've done to improve my climbing this year This might not be novel for anyone else, but figured I'd share in case it's helpful:

Reflecting back on this year so far, the most impactful thing I've done for my climbing has been getting really confident with my Top Rope Soloing. This is my third season of seriously projecting climbs, meaning 10+ sessions on them, and my previous two seasons of projects were super frustrating at times — I was constantly scrounging for belayers, wearing out my welcome with my regular partners ("can I talk you into heading to this area and belaying me on my project *again?*") and pushing the limits of common sense ("hi mountain project rando looking to climb 5.5s...I'm happy to belay you on whatever if you'll also belay me on my project"). I also found myself selecting projects with short approaches and near climbs other folks might do, to maximize the chances I'd be able to find partners.

After getting sick of all that and after hearing a bunch of folks talk about their TRS setup on climbing podcasts, I really invested in my TRSing this year. I'd done it before, but only on moderates and only very occasionally. I started by upgrading my setup, getting a Taz Lov 3, a microtraction, a nice thick semi-static rope, and a rope protector. From there, I did a few sessions where I really was only focusing on the setup, not able to concentrate on my climbing. It was frustrating, but I kept reminding myself that I was learning a new skill and it'd pay off.

Over the last couple of months, I've finally been able to break through to trying really hard while on TRS and it's so awesome, particularly with the Taz. I'm able to climb whenever and on whatever I want (of course with the caveat that it needs to be a TRS-friendly route), and I'm able to really focus on individual moves/sequences in a way I'd never do if I was taking someone else's time. For example last week I went out and spent the entire session repeating linking into the crux sequence on my project, and yesterday I spent the entire session repeating the opening boulder problem on the same route. With a belayer I'd never do a sequence, have them lower me 5 feet, pop my shoes off for 5 minutes, and repeat the same thing 3 times.

Anyhow, I wish someone would've suggested I invest in my TRS setup and abilities earlier rather than me coming to the conclusion on my own, so figured I'd share. Obviously it's dangerous and a relatively advanced thing to do, so be safe and don't fuck up and die.
Improving fear response in bouldering Hey y'all, I'm about a year into outdoor bouldering and I spend almost all of my time at a couple local crags. Recently I switched my focus to a new boulder and have been shocked at how limiting my fear of falling is in an unfamiliar area. What does an effective, safe, long-term strategy look like for pushing one's mental boundaries when it comes to bouldering?

My current plan is to start committing sessions towards improving my mental game. I know the heights, landings, and body positions I feel comfortable falling from. I figure the most effective way to improve is just to push those boundaries, fall from a little higher, experiment falling in more compromised body positions, fall with a little more horizontal momentum, etc, etc.

My biggest worry is that at some point I'll start pushing my mental boundaries too far and start doing things that are genuinely unsafe. Anyone have thoughts on how to incrementally improve my mental game without a major increase in risk of serious injury?

note: all the areas I'm climbing in are really quite safe. I'm not doing highballs and all the landings are pretty G rated. So when I get scared and overgrip towards the top of my problems I feel a bit goofy...
It doesn't have to be pretty- on the value of commitment and trying hard Your **first** time sending a problem/route doesn't have to be pretty. Especially if you're trying to flash it. 

Of course it's valuable (and important) to go back later and try to perfect your movement and beta on the climb. You can tell when you've improved as a climber when you can walk up sequences that were once absolute limit.

As someone with coaching experience, I say this because I commonly see people drop off moves, grab downclimb jugs, or just straight up give up because they can't figure out the sequence or make an error on the wall. This is incredibly common in intermediate climbers, who have heard countless times that climbing with solid technique is critical to climbing harder. It also happens as a fear response. Of course climbing *well* is important in the long term, but it's important not to lose sight of the short term goal (this one climb).

If you give an attempt, give 100%. Even if you make a small error, try to make it work- sometimes you get lucky. Climbing hard is about trying hard, and trying hard is about committing to your movements even if something goes wrong. 

This margin for error won't always be there, but learning to fully commit now (even if it isn't pretty) will engrain that "try hard" skill.
Help structuring sessions I've (35 F) been climbing for 6-7 years and climb V5 in the gym fairly consistently, rope about 11c. I go to the gym 2/3 times a week, and 8 months out of the year I go sport climbing/bouldering 2/3 times a month, usually replacing a gym session. I feel like I've been at the same level for about 4 or 5 years now, and am plateauing hard. I know the main reason for that is that I'm a lazy climber. I show up at the gym and I climb what I feel like climbing with no plan or purpose. 

I've tried to get into a training plan (mostly hangboard and other exercices), and I have so far always failed for a combination of reasons 1) I try to do too much and get discouraged 2) My shoulder starts tweaking 3) I want to climb what my friends are climbing 4) Did I say I was lazy?

**So my question: Would structuring my sessions better be enough to make progress? Can I start making small changes today to help?** 

I would love to be able to break through the plateau. I know I have the strength and technique to do it if I just apply myself. I'm very realistic that I'm not going to jump up 3 grades just by adding in one day of 4x4, but if I could start sending V6 regularly i'd be ecstatic.

Why Beginners should do Off Wall Training This was originally a comment I made in a thread on a different post here, but I thought it was a good explanation on why I think 'just climbing' is not always or even usually the best method for improvement at beginner/intermediate levels. By no means do I believe my stance to be the end-all-be-all, and I welcome discussion, criticism, and comments.

There's a strong argument to be made that strength training, executed properly and (especially early in your training age) cautiously, is an excellent way to build up general durability and injury resistance. I'm generally a believer in the idea that even absolute beginners should engage in some strength training and even hangboarding (again with caution and careful, patient progression) because the reality is that sometimes 'just climbing' will lead you to attempt things your body is not prepared for yet. 

A climb might be overall well within your capabilities, but still include holds/moves/positions which might overtax un-conditioned areas of your anatomy and leave you at a greater risk of injury while performing them. Strength training is a good way to increase your general fitness, and raise the floor of your performance range in order to make that sort of situation less likely for you. You are only as strong as your weakest link.

I also feel that avoiding strength training, especially of the fingers, wrist, and forearm, will leave you more vulnerable to overuse injuries and injuries of happenstance, such as hurting a pulley by dry-firing or hyperextension due to foot slips, etc. 

Again, all of this comes with the caveat that it should be done with extreme caution and strict moderation of training volume and intensity. I myself made the mistake of over-training early in my journey, mostly because I had already been a powerlifter for 7 years, and so I had elevated strength and work capacity in many parts of my body but lacked training experience with my fingers especially. It led to multiple wrist/finger/elbow overuse injuries that taught me some frustrating lessons. 

That situation also illustrates my point beautifully; my core, shoulders, legs, back, and arms had a high level of general strength and durability, which allowed me to out-perform my finger strength on some climbs, and led to me attempting moves on holds that my fingers were not prepared for. My body could handle the difficult positions and movements, but my fingers didn't possess the strength to back it up. This led me to sustain a (fortunately mild) pulley injury in my right ring finger while trying a V7 which required a 3-finger full crimp on a ~12mm edge in the crux. Again, the body position was well within my limit; but the weak link of my chain being unprepared led to injury.

I reassessed my methods and volume of training, stopped wasting time and energy training parts of my body that were already more than strong enough, and devoted it to training my fingers, wrists, and forearms. I haven't been injured since.
Examples of "non-climbers" climbing hard grades quickly? Inspired from a recent V11 send from Toby Segar. Just wondering if anyone here knew any other examples of this.

For some background, Toby Segar is a world class parkour athlete / youtuber, but in the last couple years has gotten more into climbing and the climbing youtube scene. I don't really know how much climbing experience Toby has, other than what is put forth in some youtube videos I've seen where he is learning about climbing or doing dyno projects, but it seems like at most Toby has been climbing 3 years or less, probably inconsistently, and has already climbed V11. Granted, I know its a one move wonder dyno, but still. Very cool to see how far parkour and general athleticism can take him. 

I'm wondering if there are any other examples of this in climbing so far, where someone has transitioned over from another sport and started sending hard incredibly fast? Just generally curious.
Good drills to practice keeping your feet on? Hi all, any good drills to practice keeping my feet on the wall? Particular small footholds when making bigger moves, my feet tend to cut and it wastes a ton of energy trying to get feet back on. I climb around v4/v5 benchmarks on moonboard and would say I’m decently strong for my grade range, which definitely contributes to my poor technique when I could just power through everything at lower levels. Now that I’m starting to get into much smaller holds and harder moves, I need to get that footwork down.
Tore a pulley... again. Frustrated, and feeling like I should never try to train endurance again. I've been a v5, 5.11 climber plateaued for years. Body tension and general strength is probably the thing preventing me from progressing on boulders, but on lead, it's definitely endurance. If I didn't get so pumped, I could do the moves.

Because of this, about 18 months ago, I did first structured training program on the Crimpd app from Lattice; a 6-week "Power Endurance" plan. If I recall, it was 3 days a week, including easy top rope ARCs but also projecting limit boulders with minimal rest. By week 5 of 6, I was having a lot of discomfort in the middle finger of my right hand. Crimping one day, my A2 partially tore (in a very scary, obvious and acute way).

I saw a doctor, and had a consult with a climbing PT online. After telling the story, their suggestion was that what likely happened was that my fingers just weren't strong enough to climb at that much volume. I didn't think 3 days a week was much, but again, my first experience with real structured training. He prescribed a 13-week rehab protocol, which worked very well for me. By 4-6 months post-injury, I was climbing normally again. My takeaway was:

- I should train finger strength before I ever train endurance again.

So I did. Once I was healed, I did another 6-week plan from Crimpd, this time their "Stronger Fingers" plan. This was much more hangboarding, weighted hangs, and less bouldering that before. Less volume = less exposure of the fingers to dynamic and uneven loading. I learned that hangboards were the safe, controlled way to Los your fingers, and are the context that is most safe to directly train finger strength. After completing this plan, I felt good, and then climbed outside a lot for the summer (easy trad). Ever since then, I warm up more strategically on hangboards whenever I go to the gym (as opposed to doing my old stretching and jogging routine). As I understood, this is a key to finger injury prevention.

Finally, this fall, I felt that with stronger fingers, I should return to some endurance training, since pumping out on lead routes was still my biggest issue. I then started the Crimpd "Base Endurance" plan.

But damn it, on week 5 of 6, it was the same story. Pulley tear on a crimp again. Same finger, other hand. I was so shocked that it happened, so upset and so confused. Thought I had done things correctly this time. That was 3 days ago. There was not nearly as much pain this time, not as much swelling, and not as much tenderness before the injury. Because of this, and manual inspection, I think that it is my A4 or A3 and not the A2. The injury doesn't feel nearly as bad as last time, but I suspect that the recovery road will be the same.

I am extremely frustrated, because I thought that I had safeguarded myself against this possibility my improving my finger strength. Also a 3-4 month recovery period obviously sucks. And I was started to make gains I was really happy with, breaking into v6. It's also frustrating to feel like endurance *is* my limited on lead, and therefore I *do* need to train it, but I never can without getting injured.

I'm meeting with Jason Hooper this week for a consult, and will try to get imaging done. So I don't have all of the information yet, but for the time being, here are some takeaways I'm already having:

- 6 weeks of strength training probably just isn't that much, and did not significantly reduce my injury risk

- Though 3 days training a week sounds safe, everyone's body is different, and I'm nearly 30... maybe I simply need 48 hours of rest during training periods rather than 24 hours

-  maybe the Crimpd endurance plans are just wrong for me. They focus a lot of limit bouldering, which isn't really aligned with my goals. All I care about it gaining the  absolute confidence and competence to climb ~5.10 trad. Maybe I should just ARC on east routes, favoring simple forearm pump over fingery boulders.

- Though my diet has been good in it's macro composition, I've been eating at deficit for the past couple of months. Maybe I should not do training plans during a cut; I have no idea if this increased tissue repair timescales

If anyone sees any other obvious takeways that I'm missing, feel free to ridicule me. Thanks for getting to the bottom of you're still here!
Any tips on how to not suck on system boards? So, I suck on system boards.

My gym has this board.  Never seen one like it anywhere else so assuming it’s on they threw up themselves.

Everything on there feels really hard.  I can complete about 2/3 moves but that seems to be it.

Does anyone have any tips?

I currently climb around V4/5 I think.
Gained a lot of finger strength quickly. What to do now? I've been climbing for 5 years now (190cm, 90kg) and sort of plateaud for 3 of them at 7A+.
I always felt my finger strength was a bit weak compared to the rest of my body, so 3 months ago I committed to structured hangboarding.

The progress has been somewhat miraculous and I went on weighted hangs from 16 kg added to 45 kg in about 12 weeks. Now I'm unsure what to do... should I just keep going or is that risking injury. Should I switch to a repeater style protocol to solidify the strength gains? Abandon it altogether and just moon board? Has anybody been in a similar position?
Novice climber could hang on 5 mm edges - how? Hey. Today I‘ve been at the gym with a new friend of mine. This dude is 19 years old, 6‘1“ tall and weighs 170 lbs.

At the beginning we‘ve been at the training area because I wanted to do my max hangs. I joked about the 5 mm edges, whereupon he suddenly hung onto them for roughly 5 seconds. 

He started bouldering in January 2023 and meanwhile does V6s on the kilter and V5s on the 2019 moonboard.

8 mm are a fight for me and this dude doesn‘t really hangboard at all and comfortably hangs onto 5 mm. I was literally stunned.

- Am I just exaggerating or is he genetically gifted? Because the only person I‘ve seen onto them so far was a dude that boulders V13.
- What‘s considered (really) hard regarding min edge hangs?
Controlling a surge of adrenaline Recently made a new high point on a limit project in my area. However after hitting this high point and dropping.

I felt an intense surge of adrenaline. This is a feeling I had never felt before. I literally did not feel sober. I felt like I had just done a bag of coke.

I rested for 5mins and the next burn I 
had I was so jittery that I was shaking on every move. I felt strong but could barely focus because the energy was so intense. 

Took some deep breaths tried to calm down and did a couple more burns but no luck.

I decided to call the session off and head to the bouldering gym. Arrived at the gym and the same feeling remained. I felt so incredibly strong/ powerful , nothing hurt and I was full of energy but my brain couldn’t keep up with what it was doing. I loved and hated it at the same time.

I felt as if I was in the part of the movie were the protagonist discovers he has super powers but can’t control them. 

Has any experienced this before. How do you handle it ? Any tips appreciated.
How much do you care about being “well-rounded” (and what does that mean to you)? Excluding training for competition (where the goal is to really be ready for whatever challenges get tossed your way), curious how people in here think about well-rounded-ness.

If there’s a style that’s not well represented in your area, or you just don’t enjoy, are you personally okay with avoiding it totally (think: horizontal roofs, crack climbing, slabs, dynos)? If you’re generally, say, a v10 climber in most styles, would you be fine with falling off v3 roofs, or would you want to bring that # up somewhere vaguely closer to your max? Do you find value in being able to walk up to *any* 5.11 or 5.12 and feel reasonably confident on it, or do you not reallly care?

Genuinely just curious how you all approach this question!
Mental cues I’ve recently found myself relying a little more on specific mental cues for certain types of moves or situations—like, “look up,” or “push with your bottom hand,” or (for sport), “you feel awful now, but you’ve recovered on worse rests before…”.

Really curious what sorts of intentional or incidental mental cues other people have—is it something you’ve cultivated on purpose? Do you have tricks for yourself to remember things at the right moment? Or maybe you just let your mind go a little blank and don’t like purposefully “planning” thoughts?

I wanna keep this question pretty open + broad, since I’m mostly just interested to hear what goes on in other people’s heads! Mantras? Breathing-related? Funny stuff?
Moonboard 2016 Benchmark Journey Hello Reddit 👋 my name is Seán O’Connor. I am an Irish climber and have become, for lack of a better word, obsessed with the Moonboard for the last few years since my local gym installed it. 

Over the last couple years I started trying to tick off all the benchmark boulders on the 2016 set and currently have ticked off 540/551 of them. I have posted the majority of the 7C and harder ones on my instagram @sean_o_conn if anyone wants to tag along for the rest of the journey :)

For those of you looking for beta vids, recently I have also started to include the name and grade of the benchmarks in the thumbnails :)

Someone from r/moonboard suggested I make this post here so I hope this connects with some of you

Happy Climbing!
Anecdotes for getting gym strong for outdoors So you often hear the phrase that "to get strong on rock, climb rock" and I totally get that with specificity in your training, you'll get better at what you practice. But for some, access to rock just isn't an option (I get one or two weekends a month).   
So I'm wondering, anecdotally, how strong could one get in the gym for outdoor climbing?   
Also for mere mortals - i know there are those janja's and tomoa's out there that has dedicated hours and over years of training on plastic and then crushing it outdoors too. But I'm curious for stories of regular joe's. Also what kind of gym training do you do to translate it outdoor (i.e. mainly woody limit bouldering).  
Thanks in advance!
Methods for Critical Force training and quantifying progression, from a boulderer **Hello, Climb Harder, Eric Jerome here!**   
On August 31st I was run over by a speeding drunk driver and broke my ankle, requiring surgery. I decided to take advantage of the time off-the-wall to attack what I perceive to be one of Achilles heels in climbing--*aerobic endurance*.   


* B**ackground and goals:** 
   * **Background:** 
      * I've been climbing since 2012 and training consistently for much of this period, always with a focus on bouldering and strength acquisition. I am generally good at power-endurance problems, however, I frequently have to climb them much faster than other ascensionists to compensate for my quickness to pump. In climbing competitions, getting very pumped and not being able to recover between problems was always my greatest detriment. In the gym, I typically become pumped during my warmup and remain pumped the majority of the session--this makes my training less effective, generally. It takes a LONG time for the pump to dissipate (sometimes 1hr.+ if I'm really bricked). I've become somewhat consistent in the V13/14 range in recent years and have climbed a couple of problems which may be up to V15. Since \~2020, I have incorporated ARCing with my feet on the ground and moving my hands about on systems boards as a method of hopefully improving CF, recovery between burns, and recovery between sessions.  This was never very measured and I am unsure of its efficacy and if I was in the appropriate intensity range. 
   * **Goals:**
      * The primary goal is to open the door for longer boulder problems. I'm not particularly inspired by these problems, but think Grand Illusion, Insomniac, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Seudain Seoul, etc. Problems requiring TUT greater than \~1:00 have been previously inaccessible to me. 
      * Secondary and tertiary goals include improving recovery time between attempts and sessions, however, skin tends to be a limiting factor for me in terms of volume, so this is not as immediately important unless I great improve my skin tactics and durability. 

After surgery, I performed my first critical force test using my Tindeq progressor while laying down and pulling against my uninjured foot. \*Notably, my scores would likely be substantially higher had I performed the test pulling down in a standing position pulling down or off-the-ground, given that my MVIC is more than 50lbs greater in those positions.\*  


**Test 1 9/23:** [^((figure 1))](https://imgur.com/a/BvXtBbK)  
Critical Force = 49.69lbs = 27.6% of my average bodyweight (180).  


When compared to other climber data found online (Lattice) and through friends, I am certainly below average for my grade (no surprise there). \*Keep in mind, my score would likely be a bit higher had I performed it standing like the below climbers.\*

**V15 mean**: 36%  
**Upper end**: 42%  
**Low End**: 30%  
Stefano Ghisolfi: 64%   
Pete Whittaker: 61%  
Emil Abrahamsson: 45%  
Dave Macleod: 43%   
Will Bosi: 41%   
Andrei Dan: 40%  
Will Anglin 40% 

**Training Intervention: October/November**  
In working with an experienced endurance coach (Matt Jones), and accounting for my lack of mobility, I roughly followed the following schedule (can extrapolate details by request). 

* 1x/weekly limit or strength session for maintenance
* 2-3 sessions/week finger curls: 
   * 3-5 sets of full ROM finger curls using Tension 20mm edge to failure in the 2-4min range. 10min rest. I primarily used a 15lbs weight. 
      * Occasionally I would swap this workout for weight-removed repeaters on the fingerboard with failure in a similar range
* 2-3 sessions/week ARC
   * Generally 3 sets of 15min walking-ARC 

**Test 2 12/12:** [^((figure 2))](https://imgur.com/a/BvXtBbK)  
Critical Force = 53.95lbs (+4.29lbs) = 29.9% (+2.3%)

[^((figure 3))](https://imgur.com/a/BvXtBbK) ^(An imperfect overlay of the two tests)  


The Tindeq app does not calculate W', but it would appear on the attached graphs that it has improved as well.  


Now that I can start climbing again, I am going to experiment by sport climbing 1-2x/week. One mileage session on more casual terrain and one project session where I am giving redpoint burns and 1-3 piecing routes. So far I have had two sport sessions and am still abysmally bad, having failed to climb 5.12 but narrowly succeeding on one 5.12-! 2-3 other days of the week will spent bouldering, mostly outside.   
I am curious to see if I have greater or lesser improvements through this intervention.   


**My questions for the group!** **^((thanks if you've read this far!))**

* Firstly, if you have them, I'd love more critical force data points for comparison!
   * Personal figures
   * Figures of other athletes
   * I'm particularly interested in how my % increase compares to other climbers and other programs
      * On average, what % improvement is "Good" or "Bad," "expected" or "unexpected" 
      * Was this cycle just mildly successful, or are these great gains? 
* Does this group hypothesize that the sport climbing intervention will be more or less effective at improving CF than the Oct./Nov. plan? 
* Do we hypothesize improving my CF will even have the desired outcome for my goals? 
* If you were to change or alter either program, what might that look like and why? 
   * What do we think is the best bang for the buck in terms of improving CF as quickly as possible?
* Maybe this post can also just generally serve as a discussion board for improving CF? I did not do a **super** thorough search, but it would seem the topic hasn't been discussed too much in this data-first approach.  


I don't post here often, so I apologize if this post is unwelcome or violates any guidelines. If there are other threads considering similar topics that I have missed, please accept my apologies (and link me;))  


All the best! Cheers and thank you!!

Reflecting Upon a Year on the Moonboard and Training Hello /r/climbharder! I've written a few posts throughout 2023 related to creating a training plan and the adjustments I made throughout the year. 

**So what is the point of this post?**
-- 
The main point of this post is to share my progress and what I have done this year while following training cycles to accomplish my goals (or lack thereof). Unfortunately, I would have loved to have linked the first couple of posts I made earlier in the year, but I got doxxed at one point and had to delete that account. 


**Before 2023**
--
 Before the start of 2023, I measured a bunch of random metrics (Not necessarily useful ones), but metrics I would continue to measure going forward [based somewhat on the not so useful 9c test.](https://www.thecrag.com/en/climbing/virtual/route/4430259711)

Skill | 2022 Measurement | July 2023 Measurement
---|---|----
V-Max (10 Second 2H Hang on 20mm Edge) | 200% BW Open Hand, 192% BW Three Finger, 192% BW Half Crimp | 220% BW Open Hand, 200% BW Three Finger, 200% BW Half Crimp
Max-Pull Up (3 Reps) | 170% BW | 180% BW
One Arm Pull Up? | Left: No, Right: No | Left: Yes, Right: Yes
Front Lever Hold? | No | Yes for ~3-5 seconds
Max Campus Board Ladder | 1-4-6 | 1-5-8

While I never ended up measuring these benchmarks later in the year, I ended up swapping from two-handed hangs to one-handed hangs sometime around August and can now hold 60lbs on the right arm one hand on the 20mm for about 3ish seconds and 45lbs on the left arm for the same time. My max-pull-up has likely decreased in favour of increasing my volume rather than load and getting more reps in around the 165% BW Load.

**Goals**
--
If I had to determine a point of failure in my training (especially between January and July, my main failure was not having a specific goal in mind to work towards or try to accomplish, meaning, I ended up training just to get strong as fuck and not to train with the idea to accomplish something climbing related. 

**Main Piece of Advice**
--
SET SOME GOALS, this especially goes out to those constantly posting on the subreddit for critiques or reviews on your training plans. If you don't have what you want to get out of training carved out in stone, training without purpose or direction will always be unfulfilling. 

[This was a pretty good article that helped me for setting goals.](https://trainingforclimbing.com/effective-goal-setting-for-climbing/)

[Steven Low's 7.5 Year Self Assessment is also a great read tangentially.](https://stevenlow.org/my-7-5-year-self-assessment-of-climbing-strength-training-and-hangboard/)

**The Goals I Set**
--
1. Get on rock as much as possible for building technique, whether it be on rope or bouldering. 
2. Climb as many moonboard (2016) benchmarks as possible.
3. Improve power endurance and route reading ability in competitions. 

**Goal 1**
--
Unfortunately, this was still my biggest failing of the year. I only ended up getting outside maybe under 20 times over the year and not having good time management skills while finishing my uni degree and bartending full time to make the effort needed to facilitate outdoor trips to get on routes or boulders.

I still ended up surpassing my expectations of flashing a V5 outdoors and sending two V6s in under two sessions alongside a V7 that was up my alley inside a session. But moving forward I need to dedicate much more time to going outside and climbing on more things. 

**Goal 2**
--
This goal I completely surpassed expectations. I will preface that when I started trying to tick all the benchmarks (loosely in order), I could send soft V7 Benchmarks. Overall, I ended up sending 379/551 Moonboard 2016 Benchmarks:

1. 77/77 V4 Benchmarks

2. 125/125 V5 Benchmarks

3. 79/79 V6 Benchmarks

4. 69/84 V7 Benchmarks

5. 26/97 V8 Benchmarks

6. 3/48 V9 Benchmarks

As well, there are three V10s I am currently within reach of sending, whether it has been punting the finishing move or having linked over half of the boulder while doing all the moves individually! Moving into 2024 I believe sending at least the remainder of the V7s is within my grasp. 

What I learned from the Moonboard (2016)
---
If I were to determine the four key skills the moon board helped with concerning skill development and improvement, the mood board is a great tool for developing:

1. Flagging Technique
2. Heel-hook Technique
3. POGO (Moon Kick) Technique
4. Holding "spanny" moves

You could make the argument climbing outdoors will be more beneficial to improving/developing these skills but in certain settings that can be an inaccessible option so if you believe these skills are a low-hanging fruit for you, I highly recommend the moonboard! At 5'6" +0 Ape, the moonboard has shown me I can reach holds I never expected to be able to before.

**Goal 3**
--
This goal was a mixed bag, running interval circuits, 4x4s and doing comp simulations for sure improved my route reading ability in identifying how to move on final boulders but I still have a lot of work to do in that area. Furthermore, I learned that pacing in a qualifier or finals is now my lowest hanging fruit in the local competitions and learning to conserve attempts properly is extremely important. Following two competitions, I realized that going forward, I would place less emphasis on this goal, while competitions are really fun, they weren't the end all or be all of what made me enjoy climbing, while I climbing the boulders themselves, I never had the competitive drive needed to push myself to the next level mentally. 

Moving into 2024, I am excited for the next bouldering season, since October I have been nursing a mild A2 Pulley sprain on my ring finger but since the end of the month it has begun feeling pain-free!  

I learned the importance of goal-setting and ensuring that you are enjoying the process of training to prevent burn-out and some skills beyond physical ability will improve your climbing and training leaps and bounds (Time Management).

I look forward to 2024 and ambitiously believe I can send a V10 boulder outdoors by the end of the year, 3-5 V10 Moonboard benchmarks on the 2016, and complete the V7 benchmarks! I look forward to drawing up a plan that will facilitate my ability to accomplish these goals

[Will Anglin and Matt Jones' Nugget Climbing Podcast Masterclass on Training is also a goldmine and will for sure apply some of the principles to my training in 2024.](https://thenuggetclimbing.com/episodes/will-and-matt)

Happy holidays and Happy New Year/r/climbharder  !!!
One arm pullup - tips to avoid tendonitis? I've gotten strong enough to do one arm pullups twice in my life, both times using similar methods of heavy weighted pull ups -> lock offs -> negatives -> one arm pullup. 

The first time I did it I developed bilateral elbow tendonitis, which eventually recovered. 

A few years later I decided to try again and got to a point of doing \~2.5 reps with my strong arm and 1 rep with my weaker one, before again being crippled by elbow tendonitis. I used steven low's golfer's elbow protocol and eventually recovered over a few months. 

At this point I'm a little traumatized and afraid to start doing heavy weighted pullups or trying to get stronger pulling power if it'll take me away from climbing again. Any tips on how to progress that kind of strength without triggering tendonitis?
I suck outdoors , how can I get my first send Just yesterday I went on my first outdoor bouldering trip to the grampains and understood I probably would drop a few grades but I performed significantly worse than that . I was not able to top out a single v0 and spent older 2 hours projecting basically half a v0 which I ended up not being able to top . I thought outdoor would be hard but had no idea that I would not be able to climb anything at all over two days of bouldering .

For context I can hang 10s on 20mm edge , can do about 7-8 pull-ups and have climbed v4 on moonboard (admittedly only once ).

Anything else (aside from experience ) that could be leading to this and any solutions / advice (aside from climbing more outdoors)
2023 Retrospective: Bouldering, Trad Climbing, Routesetting, Grading, and everything in between TLDR: I feel that numbers can be completely separate from climbing harder. Perhaps this is a fundamental disagreement I misunderstood about some of the community.

TLTLDRDR: Sorry that this post has more effort put into it than most other shit here and isn’t a hit list of golden nuggets and fucking strength metrics, but I also recognize it won’t be as directly actionable. 


It’s been two years since I climbed my first V11. Have I sent V12 yet? Nope. Does this mean I’m in a plateau? Hell no. Did I still have an identity crisis earlier this year about not climbing harder? Yep, we’ll get to that.

----------------

**Bouldering**


This year I climbed two V11s on rock and came very close to an 11/12 that’s completely anti-style. I tried a new V13, V14, and V15, doing moves on all of them quickly except for single-move cruxes. Actual links of course evaded me. Esperanza is still hard, and while I’m hoping that in February I’ll have more success on it, my gut tells me I’m still not ready. By numbers I sent the least amount of boulders on rock than any previous year, but added to my max grade. I’ve failed to push into V12 again despite knowing I’m capable. I sometimes still find climbs in the V7/8 range I can’t do.


So what does this all mean? Through the lens of climbing harder = number goes up, I’m not climbing harder. But that couldn’t be more wrong.


I flashed V9 for the first time and repeated V10 first try. I pulled up to The Game and did every move except the crux first go. I can practically warm up on V7. Routesetting has made my work capacity sky rocket, and I can usually climb V0-V8 on rock all day long. Outside of numbers, I climb *way* better. Better in my anti-styles, better in my style, better at comp slab and normal slab and crack climbing and sloper compression and pinching. 


Frankly I didn’t climb V12 because I only tried two of them. One I punted the jug at the finish, and would have taken V11 anyway. The other I nearly did in one session and stopped trying because it didn’t feel hard enough to be V12 to me. I dropped the last move of an anti-style V11 (12 imo) a couple weekends ago. So basically, I know if I actually tried more 12s, I could do them. 


But I didn’t try more 12s because this grade mindset nearly gave me depression just trying to justify to myself that I can “climb hard.” The first 6 months of this year were fine progression-wise. But I was so focused on getting better, and equated that to higher numbers, that once those higher numbers didn’t come, I felt like a failure. I made an April Fools post on Insta about sending Esperanza, only for everyone to believe me and say I should’ve picked something harder to make it a proper joke. Fooled myself with that one. 


It sounds so silly to get caught up in “not performing” when you live in Texas and have sent 95% of all boulders within 6 hours of you, but I still fell victim to the mindset again. Something about knowing that I’m way too strong and being constantly told that, internalized a standard for myself that was impossible to achieve unless I went to Hueco every weekend. Because of that, I spent the summer in a seasonal depression (no rock climbing, just focused on routesetting, barely climbing outside of work) wondering why I couldn’t even enjoy climbing Kilter moderates. I figured I should take a break from my personal climbing to reassess and get out of my own head, so I did. Eventually summer ended, I started climbing a bit more, and I finally made it back up to Colorado with my brother for two weeks in October. 


That trip reignited my passion for climbing in so many ways. I wasn’t worried about sending but doing any and all trad climbing, bouldering, comp climbing, multi pitching, sport climbing, really just enjoying the fuck out of the sport that’s taken over my life and career. And it worked. Climbing is so much fucking fun! The hardest thing I sent in CO was V7, which last time that’s the hardest grade I climbed on a trip was *checks notes* three and a half years ago. I didn’t care. I was just enjoying climbing.


I still have goals for this season, but not expectations. I want to send this nearby 11/12, I want to make a high point on Esperanza, I want to send 12/13 at Hueco in a few weeks. But I think in the past some part of me would have expected those things, feeling entitled to them because I know I’m capable and everyone tells me I am. But expectations and entitlement won’t magically get me up a climb, and that mindset in the past has screwed me many times. I’m sure it’ll come again sometime in the future, but for now I’m at peace with anything that happens. 

----------------

**Trad Climbing**


I’m still mostly a boulderer, but to say I’m not psyched on other forms of climbing would be a lie. I did my first pitches of trad back in April this year and was immediately hooked. 5.8 felt like 5.12 with my life on the line (not actually, of course). 5.6 in a corner finishing with a no hands ledge traverse for my first onsight was probably the most fun 15 minutes I’ve had on any pitch of climbing. Incredibly sandbagged 5.10 to a runout friction slab with only two bolts made me understand that flashing V10 on the Moonboard don’t mean jack shit in 90s trad-dad-denim-land. I have fallen on one trad climb so far, and it was on a bolt, and it was way fucking scarier than if you told me to fall on any of my questionable pieces up to that point.

 
So many words have been written about traditional climbing by people far more eloquent and experienced than me that I won’t even try to convey the feeling I get when on the sharp end. What I can say is that leading the Bastille Crack with 0 multipitch experience and 5 trad leads under my belt was fucking terrifying but I would give anything to experience those few hours again for the first time. 10/10. Climb in the V11 range if you want to flash something like this with no experience because I still almost fell on pitch 3. 


I guess the “climb harder” relation here is that many of my dream boulders have highball topouts or are highballs themselves. Think Spectre, Lucid, Kintsugi, Esperanza (jk), or The Fly. Obviously being comfortable on slab terrain in the no fall zone is a great skill to have for these climbs. I’ve done easy soloing, scrambling, and an “X” rated boulder (which is R at most IMO), but expanding this skill set on trad is better both for trad mileage and bouldering.

----------------

**Routesetting**


What an odd job. Probably the least efficient way to get your body strong for climbing, but if it doesn’t kill you boy does it make you strong. I seem to be a freak and have remained uninjured and gotten stronger over the past two years despite no training and climbing on average 5-6x/week. Most of my coworkers are injured.


Setting has really changed the way I think about climbing. Grades, movement, equitability, ego, commercialization, and many other words come to mind. Let’s start with:


Commercialization. Climbing is growing exponentially. Many articles, Instagram posts, forum threads and the like have already commented/lamented/criticized/encouraged climbing’s growth and changing direction. My take isn’t unique or nuanced: more people climbing is good, more people going outdoors is good, climbing isn’t losing its “soul” you’re just spending too much time online, chipping/access/LNT is a growing concern and the real thing climbing is losing is proper mentorship. Gyms have no responsibility or incentive to fix this because it won’t bring a profit. Insert comment about capitalism here.

 
Ego. Ties into grades heavily but oh well. I see lots of complaints about people’s gym’s routesetting on Reddit. I don’t know if you all have actually horrible setters everywhere or if you don’t appreciate other styles of climbing or what. But many people seem to feel entitled to sending a grade/circuit/style in their gym. I see this in my local chain and the gyms I set at as well. Setters are similarly influenced by their ego: climbs are soft because they did a sandbagged V5 at Hueco one time or this simulator should get set because “I wanna do the real one this season.” I actually had a great conversation with a beginner climber today about a couple of our 5.9s feeling harder than 5.10s in our gym. We talked and he threw up his hands and said to the extent of “who cares, it’s fun and shit feels different to different people.” That guy may as well climb 5.15 with that attitude holy shit, legend. 


Equitability. Climbing is hard. Setting is harder. Setting a “V5” that feels “V5” for your 6 year old and your grandma is impossible. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of grades and my job. I don’t care if your 6ft tall friend reached past the crux of your V6 proj, he won’t do the V4 mantle I just set on volumes nearby. I don’t care if you can’t reach the pogo-paddle-redirect-gaston-undercling-footstomp because you can’t jump. Go learn how to jump better. If you still can’t do it, the gym is on an 8-week rotation, there’s plenty to do. You think Ai Mori is trying The Big Island anytime soon? Is Kai Lightner gonna waste his time on Burden of Dreams?


Movement. Having to consistently think about how *other people* will/have to/can move has changed the way I think about *myself* moving. A sort of “you can only know the material once you can teach it” type approach. And yet, the more I learn and discuss with fellow setters and climbers, the more I realize I don’t know shit. I still get my mind blown watching some people climb. I still surprise myself on the wall. I still watch that Dave Graham interview. I still wish I could be a fly on the wall anytime /u/cptwangles talks about climbing. The best thing you can do to understand climbing movement besides being rich and traveling the world to climb, is to become a setter.
Which leaves one last word:


Grades. “It’s good to know we all judge ourselves based off some fucked up construct out of your [John Sherman’s] mind.” -Kris Hampton


We live by grades, yet we must not die by grades. Why are half the posts in r/bouldering now “guess the grade?” How come when I call gym V5 slab there a V1 I get 30 downvotes? Don’t they know I’m a setter? /s
I tried making a post about advocating for gradeless, betaless outdoor climbing. [That went well.] (https://old.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/180lv25/rawdogging_reality_climbing_and_deliberate/)


My takeaway from the above post was that people can’t seem to separate grades from climbing harder. Perhaps this is a fundamental disagreement I underestimated about the community. Like I discussed in my opening paragraphs, am I not climbing harder now than a year ago, despite not sending V12? Even if I take away the numbers from those climbs, I can do more, physically/technically/mentally difficult climbs than a year ago. Is that not climbing harder?


I am confused. Grades confuse me. Reddit confuses me. I confuse me. The more I set routes and boulders the less I know what grade to call them, ironically. Some days I go to the Kilterboard and downgrade climbs almost three numbers below their given grade. Some days I upgrade Moonboard V5s to V8. Sometimes I won’t stop spraying about how there’s no way this climb in Oklahoma is V11 because *xyz* and this one V10 in CenTex is way harder than 10, let alone 11 because I can’t do it and I’m the strong crimp guy.


Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
Trouble keeping fingers together when crimping Only have trouble on the left hand but included both sides for reference. Should I be worried? Tried taping the fingers together when climbing and i definitely climb worse now.
Are one arm pull up really more specific to climbing than weighted pull up? I always hear people saying that once you are strong enough with pull ups, you should start training the one arm pull up instead of weighted pull up. Are one arm pull up really more useful than weighted pull up for climbing or is it just because they look more impressive than weighted pull up?

When doing heavy weighted pull up, let's say +160% BW, both palms are facing away from you in the same direction similar to the position we are used to when we are climbing routes or training on a campus board. Weighted pull up help develop power for dynamic reachy moves as well as for the campus board.

When doing a one arm, the first option would be to have the palm facing us which would become a one arm chin up in that case. Such movement is less common in climbing. The second option would be to have the palm facing away from us. The problem I see with this option is that people will often add a 90*°*  rotation because of the asymmetry and finish the movement with the palm sideways to their body.

Thoughts?
Moving to climb harder? Not sure if this is the correct place, but I've seen the advice on here a few times so I figured I'd ask. 

To me: I am a mid-twenties mechanical engineer who is currently living in Central Germany. I basically only boulder, climb solid 7C in a full session / project 8As (outdoors). My current closest crag is pretty small and a 1h drive away - the next biggest one is around a 2h drive. I've visited Switzerland quite a few times over the years, with 2023 being my busiest year - 3 trips to chironico, 2 to brione and 2 to magic wood. All are absolute world class destinations and my favourite places to be - but it's a 7-9h drive every time, and while I don't mind driving longer distances I am considering moving closer to the south - either southern Germany, Switzerland itself or to Austria to check out more of their amazing crags. 

My main goal is obviously to spend more time on rock and get stronger. Ideally that would mean to get on rock even during the week while in season, or atleast have good, close destinations for short trips. Obviously a good climbing community is also essential for me, because good climbing buddies make the trips and training way more fun. 

I wanted to ask if someone had made a similar choice, what factors they were looking at, and if they have any tips or things they wish to have done differently! 

To any people already living in these areas, what places can you recommend? What cities are well-suited for these goals, and which ones to avoid? 

Thanks for any advice 🙏
Wanted to clear some things up about my youtube video. Someone shared it here recently. Link to video: \[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gZGFJIYBIY\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gZGFJIYBIY)

Hey it's me, the guy in the video. Just wanted to clear up some common questions.

I tried to make a new account with my name but all my responses were hidden. Reddit account doxed I guess rip.

\*\*Athletic Background\*\*

\\\~2014-2019 (13yo-18yo graduating highschool) \\\~135lbs

I've been committing myself to sports for well over a decade. Through high school I was a 4 sport athlete where I played volleyball, basketball, ultimate frisbee and track and field (100m, 4x100m relay, high jump, long jump, triple jump). Additionally I also played club volleyball for 3 years as a left side and libero. I wouldn't say I played any of these sports at an elite level. I did make some finals in track and field in 100m, high jump and triple jump but never podiumed. I didn't take the sport all too seriously though, I didn't have spikes and I just trained super casually (ex. I never learned how to fosbury flop, meaning I made finals just y scissoring).

October 2017 I started working out in the gym/powerlifting. First time doing any weighted movements. Around end of January 2018 I peaked in my powerlifting by deadlifting 405lbs. Here I had bulked to 155lbs. I also benched 215lbs and squatted 385lbs around this time. Now this does seem pretty nuts but hard to tell since I did it for such short of a duration and I was only 16/17yo at the time. I trained 6 times a week, Push Pull Leg (emphasizing bench and overhead press on push, deadlift and weighted pull ups on pull and squat and leg press on leg)

After pulling 405 my CNS was so taxed that I was a potato for 2 weeks after and I never returned to committed training. I just maintained what I had and partied. Going off to university in Sep 2019 I didn't do any training besides occasional intramural volleyball.

This can all be corroborated with my fitness instagram @ loiduong\\\_fitness. \[https://www.instagram.com/loiduong\\\_fitness/\](https://www.instagram.com/loiduong\_fitness/)

From Sep 2019-Aug 2020 I virtually didn't do any sports or training. I just partied and drank a lot.

\*\*Climbing Background\*\* (19yo-22yo, in university)

\*\*Why Don't I Climb V14\*\*

Okay so why don't I climb V14? Short answer is that I am a comp climber.

Additionally, I haven't had a good opportunity to project something hard and I haven't had the time to grow into my strength. This most recent fall season was spent focusing on comp climbing and therefore very little board climbing and going outside. Currently I plan on doing a pretty big board cycle and I have good progress on some Kilter V12s that I believe will go down relatively soon.

Also you should note that any PR is not a new standard. Since I emphasize muscular recruitment, my peak days are extremely good while my medium and bad days are honestly quite humbling. This means that I only have the opportunity to utilize my peak peak strength maybe twice a month. The baseline strength is slowly growing but the flux is just a symptom of not having climbed for so long.

Additionally the difference in strength in different finger positions are significant. I very rarely full crimp except for in performance scenarios, my tendons are simply not yet accustomed to what high level outdoor climbers can do in terms of full crimp. Performance metrics do not account for force production in full crimp positions and I believe that is where most of the discrepancies lie (Aka people can make up for a lot of finger weakness but having robust full crimps). I just believe that the method I have taken is more steady and that I will eventually build up my max full crimp potential while avoiding injury.

\*\*Why I Don't Think I Am An Outlier\*\*

I think I am less of an outlier than you think. In all of the sports I’ve participated in I was never performing at an elite level. You could argue in powerlifting but keep in mind my PR’s we’re all on different days and I am not close to the Canadian records for my weight and age group. Perhaps I would be closer if I had participated for longer than 8 months but we will never know. Maybe the speed of my progression was elite but I’m not sure that is the case

It’s also difficult to gauge because I'm not sure how much of a bubble I've put myself into. I currently train with some of the top athletes in my country (Canada) and although physically I have some gifts they are all much more impressive in terms of climbing while absolutely paying no attention to physical strength. The reason I don't think I am an outlier is because if these athletes took the same care and attention to their training, diet and recovery then I think they would get pretty similar results. But maybe I am surrounded by extreme outliers myself.

In general my goal with the video wasn't to say everyone can get this strong, just that I think that this is a potential optimal strategy to attain performance goals (i.e. I think it is the most minimum effective dose that produces very efficient and measurable gains). Burning a climbing session to do off the wall training is just not worth it to me because the goal is climbing. This way I can maintain strength gains and climbing skill acquisition.

Hope this helps!
Mini Moonboard, first impressions In October I put up a Mini Moonboard. So far I am pretty happy with this, as it feels like the most out-door like of all commercially available pre-set boards.

I have not had that many sessions on it yet, as I am mostly climb routes, have been increadibly busy with work and just moved to a new country.

In my opinion, The mini is both fun and effective for those who boulder 7B (outdoors) or harder. Can also be worth it for those who can boulder 7A — if they add a few more good holds to the layout. A lot of climbing in a small space with the sound philosophy that no one gets strong by pulling on big holds.

How to get skin like pro climbers In the newest Toby Roberts video I saw that he climbed for 6 hours, trying stuff that was pretty close to limit the whole time. Whenever I have a limit training day, I can never go for more than an hour and a half. I wouldn't say he's significantly better than me on a board, obviously much better than me in general lol but I put down the routes he was trying in the video fairly quickly. I've also heard a lot of pro climbers having 5+ hour board sessions. How do they get this type of skin? Is it genetics/starting early or is there a way I can extend my board sessions?
Most Supplements Don’t Work [https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/sweat-science-performance-supplements/](https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/sweat-science-performance-supplements/)  
Although I am not a big fan of Outside, this is an article that is worthwhile, especially for this crowd. 

[link](https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/sweat-science-performance-supplements/)

"*Think of the recent furor over carbon-plated running shoes: a  demonstrated performance boost of as much as 3 percent has completely  upended the sport. The reason supplements haven’t had a similar impact  isn’t because they’re a secret that only Andrew Huberman’s listeners  know about. It’s because they don’t work in any meaningful way.*"
Crimping with finger tips pointed directly downwards Image 1 - My normal half crimp on an 8mm edge

Image 2 - A finger tip down style grip

I have been experimenting with different grip types. And I have noticed that Image 2(finger tip down) is a lot more powerful on smaller holds & painful. As opposed to a normal half-crimp.


It seems like this grip type changes the entire anatomy of what tendons or under load. And the only drawback I’ve noticed is the pain factor, and possible bruising on the finger tip bone?


Has anyone experimented with this, or have any insight on the reliability for this or if it worth training. I tried searching around and couldn’t find anything related.
How do you develop the capacity to climb multiple days in a row? I was on climbing trip recently, and I had to take at least one or two days off between climbing days. I wasn't climbing limit boulders, only things I could do in ~1 session. There were several times I would have liked to climb two days in a row to take advantage of good weather, but when I tried, the second day I didn't feel like I could do more than 3 attempts on anything harder than V4. 

I see elite climbers on YouTube climbing pretty hard at least two days in a row. How did they get to that point? Are they actually climbing a bit below their limit one of those days? Example: https://youtu.be/EtzYdrNITEU
Another PIP and DIP joint pain success story I am please to announce that after 8 months of nagging pain I have finally found a solution, and it’s easier than anything imaginable. The only hard part is practicing restraint. I hope this story will help cure someone’s pain in the future. But alas this story has a sample size of 1. TLDR below.

So here are the stats. I’m 27, 6ft and 185lb. 
I climb max around v9/10. 
For 8 months my right middle PIP and intermittently the DIP joint would be in pain  or swollen/tight feeling 24/7. It was on my mind every second of every day. The pain would go away while climbing and immediately come back when at rest. It was SO ANNOYING. It was without a question an overuse injury, climbing 4 days a week at 3/4 hours a session consistently for many, many months.

So to get to the point, here is how I accidentally solved it. I had a lat tear injury that forced me to rest for a full month. And guess what… it didn’t do anything. Rest does not help. I knew it wouldn’t do anything because it’s a joint but I had to rest and do my PT anyway so it was worth a shot to rule out for sure. 6 weeks went by doing that. Finger still in pain every single day. Though I will say the irritation went down obviously because I wasn’t using it but never truly went away. 

What actually helped was my PT guy telling me to climb for 4 weeks way under my flash grade (for me v0-4) once my lat was ready to reintroduce climbing back in. He said, spend no more than 15 minutes on the wall and you’re done for the day. So I just kept it to 15 boulders to be safe, never had to do multiple attempts because again it’s all way below flash grade so it’s easy to keep track when flashing everything. So I began to do this mon, wed, fri for 4 weeks and I think this was the golden key. I was strict. 15 boulders, and never touched a v5 no matter how soft it looked. All of a sudden my pain started to go away. Weird right? It’s like I’m not overusing it or something. Lol.

I just happened to also start doing farmer curls (I think that’s the name) every single day during these 4 weeks. I would stand and hold a 20LB dumbbell (never ever increase the weight as you go on) let it roll down my fingers and then roll it back up into my hand. 20 reps 3 sets each hand in the morning and at night, skipping them at night if I had a climbing sesh. 

I’ll also note I obviously had to try Emil’s no hang protocol I’m sure most of you have heard of but I think I used too much weight and it doesn’t move your fingers at all. I think the rolling of the weights moving your fingers in and out really helped more than anything.

No joke, after doing these 2 things for 1 week I already noticed a big change. However progress is not linear and there was some ups and downs in week 2/3 but I’m now finished with my 4 weeks of easy climbing and it’s essentially gone. It’s unreal. I had a climbing session and the next morning I wasn’t stiff or in pain. 

I now go on for 2 more weeks moving into v5/6 doing the same things just harder climbing and my fingers are feeling unreal. Continued into 2 weeks of v7/8 and I’m flying free. I also refuse to crack my fingers because I want to keep this momentum going and it only irritates them.

Pleased to answer any questions.


TLDR: Rest doesn’t do anything. Climb no more than 15 super easy below flash grade boulders 3x a week for 4/6 weeks. Do not go over the 15 climbs and wonder why it’s not working. Introduce easy farmer curls 3 sets of 20 morning and night.
Thoughts on spraywall ? I came across a video of Adam Ondra saying that spraywall is the best tools to progress for intermediate climbers, even better than dead hangs, campus board or pull ups. I started to do some basic training but it's a bit boring tbh so I thought to myself why not try ?

My regular gym doesnt have a spraywall or kilter/moon board, sadly. But the other day I tried another gym a bit further than my regular one and they had a spraywall ! 

But I had no idea how to set my own problem at my limit. Is it hard to do ? Should I ask for the staff for guidance or pay for a few hours so they can teach me how to set my own problem on it ? Any ressources on how to use ? General thoughts on it ?
What is the average height of the best competition climbers? (crosspost with r/CompetitionClimbing and [r/climbing](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/))

I was interested in the height data of the best climbers in the world. On the rock it’s hard to define the best, even if someone kept a complete ranking of hard sends (usually those rankings include just a few top climbers and just the two/three hardest grades) comparing climbers based on grades would not be useful if they climb different routes, probably in different countries. But in competitions every athlete is tested on the same route and we have perfect data archives - the [IFSC rankings](https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/world-competition/ranking). I’ve been looking for some analyses of this data, but couldn't find anything (except for [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitionClimbing/comments/z851i0/ifsc_finalists_age_and_height/) post), so I downloaded and visualized them myself. Here you have the main results. First two plots show the combined (lead and boulder) World Ranking 2023, and the last two show the annual  World Cup Rankings.

You can read the whole analysis at [my blog](https://www.thinkingclimbing.com/2023/12/what-is-average-height-of-best.html),  where I explain the rankings data, present more plots, list the  climbers by name etc. Here I will copy the main summary points (which are a bit simplified):

* The best male lead climbers are around 174 cm tall and the best boulderers around 175 cm tall.
* The best female lead climbers are around 163 cm tall and the best boulderers around 164 cm tall.
* The best male climbers are on average 4 cm shorter than their non-climbing peers and female climbers around 1 cm shorter.
* In both, men's and women's categories, the best boulderers are taller than the best lead climbers.
* The difference between bouldering and lead climbing has been shrinking during the last decade, especially since 2019.
* It is harder to maintain consistently good results in bouldering than in lead climbing.

It  is also important to note that the height distribution of the best  climbers is narrower than the height distribution of the general  population (i.e. outliers will have a harder time).

Hope you like it! And if you want to play around with the data yourself I share the Jupyter Notebook and all data files on [my blog](https://www.thinkingclimbing.com/2023/12/what-is-average-height-of-best.html).
280% BW on 20 mm edge… Genuinely curious if you can get more outlier than this. 280% BW on 20 mm edge, only around 20 years old, and has only climbed 3-4 years primarily indoors (from what I’ve seen of his social media). Crazy!
How often do you guys train? I've really pushed my training to the limit over the last few years, adding more and more sessions.

Currently, I'm at 5-6 sessions per week, which includes climbing, finger training, and additional strength training. Recently, I stumbled upon this post: [https://alphaclimb.io/articles/training-insights-from-60-elite-boulderers/](https://alphaclimb.io/articles/training-insights-from-60-elite-boulderers/) 

It suggests that pro climbers might only train up to 4 times a week, including all their strength training and climbing.

What are your thoughts on this?
When did you think your finger strength was enough? I've always never really been able to hang more than 150% bw on a 20mm edge. Despite this I perceived my strength climbing on edges, esp smaller positive  edges, but now edging in to V10 I feel it may be a limiting factor (of course it's problem specific but let's say generally for fingers problems). For those that climb around this grade range, when did you feel your fingers were strong enough to send without finger strength being a limiting factor? I see a lot of data on Lattice but I'd like to hear more personal anecdotes of how you got your fingers strong enough around this grade, and if any what your metrics were (and if you feel that mattered!)
How to train generating from awkward positions ^ the position I'm stuck in

I recently started trying Art of the moment on the 2019 moonboard, and I quickly got all the moves down except the second one. It involves a crazy high foot and generating from a gaston-pinch thing. I can get into a locked off position, but I can't generate even an inch from it. 

What should I train or some exercise I should do to get better at this type of generation?
New(ish) Study on Max-Hangs with Large Rounded Edge. A recent paper (available open access here: https://peerj.com/articles/15464/) has been published suggesting that very heavy hangs on a large sloping edge (60mm in the study) may be superior in some ways to max hangs using a crimp or open hand grip on a standard (in this case 21mm) edge. I believe they found greater flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor carpi radialis activation, similar (slightly reduced) flexor digitorum profundus activation, and less extensor digitorum communis activation in the large sloper compared to crimp position (if I have understood correctly). Their suggestion is that this may be a viable alternative to standard max hangs with less chance of injury. I guess this also perhaps dovetails with some of the stuff that Tyler Nelson has recently discussed with respect to training the whole hand rather than just the fingers. 

I tried it today using some of those large circular wooden blob holds you often find on campus boards. I had to add significantly more weight than for normal 20mm max hangs (about 25kg more). But my fingers felt great during and after, and my forearms feel absolutely annihilated even 11 hours after the session. I did 3 sets of 5 second hangs before a fairly light climbing session (this is when I standardly to finger training).

I’m wondering if others have tried this style of max hangs, and what your thoughts on the pros & cons could be of incorporating it into a training program (for example, how do FDS, FCR, FDP, and EDC compare in relative importance etc.). I’d also love to hear any criticisms of the study from people more knowledgeable than me…
What is your preferred way to increase overall session capacity/stamina for bouldering? I feel the most confusing part of climbing training is the realm of endurance/power endurance/capacity for bouldering. I am aware that these are different energy systems that can be trained specifically, but we also know that there is plenty of overlap and grey area when it comes to how these energy systems work and what claims are made for how to train them best for bouldering. It seems to be a hot topic right now split between high intensity/low volume and lots of easy mileage.

As the title suggest, I am personally most interested in hearing what people do to increase overall capacity for bouldering. i.e. increasing the ability able to put more tries on a boulder/try more boulders in a session or outdoor day.

Whether it's traditional power endurance type exercises like 4x4s, more aerobic focused by cycling ropes, or simply strategically increasing volume by some other type of structured boulder intervals. 

What do you do? What has worked best for you?
Is hanging on a 20mm edge supposed to be easy? Hello, I'm primarily a trad climber that's getting sick of 5.9 feeling hard and scary, so I've finally decided to get serious about actually training, instead of just climbing. It seems that a common piece of advice to improve in your trad climbing is to actually sport climb and boulder, which previously I almost never did outdoors. I took this to heart and as a part of this, I've been looking up ways to structure a training plan and common strength benchmarks to identify weaknesses to train as I wait for the weather to turn so I can get outside.

I was rather surprised, and somewhat dismayed, to find that my fingers are apparently incredibly weak. Every video I've watched on finger strength assessment has subjects hanging on 20mm edges with various amounts of added weight or lengths of time. Apparently the 20mm edge size is a good baseline standard for measuring finger strength. This is hilarious to me, since I can't hang on a 20mm edge for any amount of time whatsoever. Like not even close to it feeling remotely possible. There are online calculators that convert hangtime/edge size/weight-added to a sport/boulder grade and they don't provide options low enough to actually represent my capabilities. I'll set the parameters to the lowest possible (which are still harder than what I can actually hang) and according to them I should be at a V0 or below level. This blew my mind because I can consistently redpoint 12a and send V5 at the gym. In fact I've always felt that crimpy climbs were my preferred style.

For some background I've been climbing for 9 years now, though with a 3 year break during covid. I don't know what my max outdoor grades would be since I've never projected sport routes but last year I onsighted a random 10c I walked by between trad climbs, and have flashed up to v2, but again on a whim; I've never done any dedicated bouldering sessions. Some other info: weight: 185 lbs (84 kg), height: 6'9'' (205 cm).  

Anyway, my question is: is this normal? I've been doing the 2x daily Emil Abrahamsson hangboard protocol for the last month (except only once daily, and not on climbing days) to help improve recruit these muscles since any more intense protocol is too difficult and I end up needing to use jugs to complete the reps/sets. I can now max hang on a 30mm edge for 7 seconds and on a 25mm edge for 2 seconds with BW, but 20mm still feels impossible hard. Does anyone else have experience with sucking at hangs? How did you get better? All beginner-level protocols I've read about I wouldn't be able to come close to completing even on the biggest edge. Could it be my weight has something to do with it? It's kinda depressing to be this atrociously bad at an exercise that seems to be basic for most, and for it to feel like it's not improving despite dedicating fair effort to it for more than a month. The takeaway from my research is that everyone says finger strength is the #1 most important factor in your climbing ability so clearly this is something that's been majorly holding me back. Honestly maybe I should be happy to climb as hard as I do considering my finger strength supposedly corresponds to less than V0. Any advice is appreciated, thanks.
Proper Heel Hooking Technique? Saw this post last week, where many people stated that rotating your knee out while heeling causes a lot of pressure on the LCL. The comments pointing that out have since been deleted but wanted to see everyone’s opinion on proper heel hook technique and what to avoid.
Trying to stay motivated Recently I've fallen into quite the slump with my training, and even though keep doing it I've lost a lot of my motivation and desire to get better. I can do every boulder in our gym in 1-2 goes, so all can do is train on the spray wall. However no one else uses it, so all my routes are just stuff I put up, and to add to that can't get outside very much. It seems like there's no light at the end of the tunnel, and cant see a time in the near future when I get lots of fun stuff to climb. 

I do still enjoy climbing, and definitely don't want to stop but I just want to change things up. Obviously there's a bit of room to grow with strength metrics, but I don't think it'll help my climbing very much.

I haven't tried any new grades for at least a year, and rarely get to do limit stuff outside. I've had periods like this before, but they went away pretty quickly when there was still easy room for improvement.

 What could do to spice up my training/climbing to get stoked again? I really love climbing, but kind of have fallen into a rut
How to increase “mental fitness” I have been climbing for almost 7 years, sport climbing for 4, and started leading trad last season. 

By far, my most limiting factor is my mental fitness. I minimal fear bouldering and none on TR, but when it comes to outdoor sport and trad climbing, I am always so scared of falling. 

I know this is normal. I’ve tried taking practice falls in the gym, tried the “bang” unexpected sport falls, and climbing things harder than I can do to try to force myself to fall organically (terrifying). When it comes to trad climbing, I have been working on confidence and knowing my limits, and I feel like I’ve made progress there. 

I’m just wondering if anyone has tips on how they’ve gotten into the mindset of falling. What exercises do you do that benefit your mental strength the most? I just can’t help but think of all the ways I could get hurt falling, even though in reality I’m not afraid of some bruises I would just like to not permanently maim myself. 

Do I just need to train harder and get stronger / more stamina so I can be more confident? Do I need to accept the risk of permanent injury and just do my best to avoid it…
I made a Holds Search for Kilter Climbs [https://www.kilterlookup.com/search](https://www.kilterlookup.com/search)

I got annoyed at trying and failing to find climbs I see already up on the Kilter Board, so I've been developing a website that's sort of like an advanced Kilter climbs search. You can find Kilter climbs based on things such as the holds on the climb, the grade range you want, campus-only climbs, the board's angle, and you can sort them by difficulty, popularity, and alphabetically.

I don't make any money off this project, and I don't plan on it, in fact, I'm losing money keeping the website up but I think it's worth it if it can help some climbers out. I've posted this in r/kilterboard but thought I might post it here as well since it might reach and help out more people. Also, feel free to voice any suggestions/improvements I can make to the website, I would love to hear them, and I'll do my best to implement them.

Also worth mentioning it works with all sizes and variations of Kilter Original as well as Kilter Homewall (Right now I'm only including climbs with 5 or more ascents so the website loads faster but I might add a button to enable searching through every listed climb if people are interested in that).

Note: You can also use it to find climbs with your favorite holds, for example, if you enjoy pinch holds and you want to find a V3-V5 that uses pinch holds, you can definitely do that :D

(also this isn't at all an official Kilter app, just putting that out there)
need to find motivation to stretch pretty much the title. 18 years old, climbing \~v8 indoors, projecting 13a, been climbing pretty consistently for \~3 years now. i've come to realize that my complete and utter lack of flexibility/mobility is the number one thing holding me back, especially on lower grades that i should absolutely be able to do (some 6's, 5's, hell even the occasional 3). and yet, i've got zero motivation to fix it. 

&#x200B;

i've tried stretching in the past, following tom merrick's full body routine every other day or two. despite all the misery that came with it, i saw minimal improvements, still being unable to sit up straight with my legs in front of me (pike?)

&#x200B;

i know my lack of flexibility is eventually going to be the reason for a major injury (putting me off climbing indefinitely), but even that isnt enough motivation to suffer through stretching daily. this realization also comes at a time where i'm burning out from climbing/training in general, so maybe it's time to step away for a month or two and return when my love for climbing returns. idk. 

just wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar/any advice to share. thanks.
Tindeq vs Pitch6 Force Board I'm looking at getting a strain gauge for fun and because I don't have a gym membership and it's probably cheaper than buying as many weights as high as it can measure.

I tried searching but didn't find anything that compares the [Pitch6 Force Board](https://pitchsix.com/products/force-board-portable) and the [Tindeq Progressor](https://tindeq.com/product/progressor/).

I've only played with someone else's Progressor before. The Pitch6 app looks a bit more full featured, but I noticed that they don't give their sample rate and there's no rate of force development assessment on the app? The Force Board's base model is a little bit cheaper and goes up to 300kg vs Tindeq's 200kg. For fingers This isn't a big deal, but I am interested in larger exercises like squat isometrics or deadlift isometrics. I've never hit 200kg in either of those before, but I haven't been too far off (think my best deadlift was something like 140kg... and I wasn't training it).

I've had a LOT of trouble training endurance on my home walls and climbing outside, so I thought that having a critical force test to benchmark progress would also be handy, both apps/tools seem to have that.

At this point I'm kind of lost comparison-wise. Does anyone have experience with either and have downsides? Or even more helpful would be if you had experience with both and can compare the two!
My experience case study recovering from an A2 tear + A1 strain with BPC-157 I figured I would submit my experience here for the record. When I was looking for information about BPC-157 for pulley injury rehab I found limited information -so here's my limited experience.

At the end of January 2024, I tore my A2 on a dyno move on the moonboard. I came into the session feeling slightly tired, but resolved to test where I was at anyway. Upon pulling onto the board I found myself extremely recruited and immediately sent what had been a mini-project during my warmup. Continued good climbing emboldened me and I started to climb more aggressively leading to a loud pop while holding the swing on a dynamic move. For the rest of the night, I felt limited tenderness on palpation and thought that maybe it wasn't too bad. In the morning that thought was proven wrong with some feelings of bowstringing and pain while holding 15lbs on the tension block largest edge.

I ceased from climbing from here on, but managed to further exaserbate the injury as I was out belaying a friend and we were hauling bags up and I too hastily was pulling on the rope. From here on, I could feel that there was some more involvement from the A1 as that presented some tenderness inside of the palm as well. Finger rolls presented no discomfort and full range of motion.

I started taking BPC-157 at the recommendation of a friend on Feb 3, 250mcg injected subcutaneously in the finger -once in the morning -once at night. No climbing during this time, but testing my fingers on the tension block with 15lbs to assess recovery.

Within 1 week, it felt like the A2 had significant recovery (this may have happened without the injections as well) and I could hold the 15lb block without any "feeling" of bowstringing. It was around this time that I got an ultrasound, which showed a grade 1 pulley injury.

I continued this routine with the subjective feeling that my injury was healing MUCH faster and building much more integrity than previous injuries which had taken 6+ months to heal.

At around Feb 15, I started to experience some unexpected side effects. It's possible that this was a bad batch as I had just moved onto a second vial but it could also just be a compounding of the material in my system. My finger started to stay very swollen all day and felt like it was retaining fluid. It became somewhat difficult to do finger rolls because it felt like my digits were too swollen in the skin to close properly.

During this week, I went back to the gym and tried some light climbing. I was able to climb open handed without any pain and felt capable of doing some very light crimping on climbs where I could load my feet. This was far better progress than I would ever expect from being less than 3 weeks out from a loud pulley pop.

From here out, my side effects started to become concerning -I was experiencing some pain doing finger rolls and my A1 and flexor tendon were starting to become very tender. My A1 / flexor areas started to hurt if I would aggressively try to "EXTEND" my fingers which was somewhat alarming. However, I gained enough confidence to even begin doing some crimping and climbing at a level which I considered "hard" for me in a really short period of time.

At this point, I've ceased using BPC and the swelling has totally disappeared and my fingers are feeling the side effects less. Though, I am still experiencing flexor pain on extension. I won't be getting back on it as the pain was concerning enough -and I had not been experiencing discomfort from finger rolls at all before.

I'm not sure how much I'm able to conclude from my experience. I will say subjectively, I do believe BPC-157 helped me rebuild tendon integrity MUCH faster than my previous tendon injury experiences -but I am not experiencing some lingering pains which I did not have before.

I'm not sponsored or endorsing anything. I'm just sharing my experience for posterity.
Just hit 90kg on the tindeq. Love this thing Got the tindeq less than a month ago. Usually use it to warm up then 2-3 max pulls before a session. When I got the tindeq I was pulling less than 65kg, I think I had bad technique to begin with so numbers changed quickly at first but there's no doubt my fingers have gotten stronger. Aiming for 100kg now
2 year plateau, losing psych on climbing. Looking for recommendations to breakthrough mental and physical barriers Hopefully this doesn’t come off as me rambling, but hoping someone can help point out where I can improve for climbing gains. I have been climbing somewhere around 8-9 years and have been stuck at V8 for ~2 years. 

Some quick facts:
- 30 y/o male. 6-1, ~170 lbs
- do not sport climb anymore, havent in 2-3 years. I exclusively boulder (due to time and partners)
- I own a TB2 at 40 12x8 in my garage, and 2 hangboards plus micro edges. 
- 2 hours from Chatt climbing. Also 30 min from a large climbing gym

About 2 years ago I had a breakthrough and sent several solid V8s and many old V7 projects. It was during my wife’s first pregnancy and I stopped drinking and was training hard and going outside every weekend. 

The following year I had a bit of a down year due to being a dad, but still managed a couple more V8s and 7s. I built a Tension Board 2 in my garage for training. 
- I climb the tension board 2 times per week, usually resting 1-2 days in between.
- I rotate hangboard protocols (10/50, Max hangs, min edge), average 1-2x per week and I cycle a protocol for about 2 months and break a month. 
- I don’t go over 3 training days per week. I do not lift weights or train outside climbing and hanging. I also mountain bike once a week. 

Over the past 2 years I can attribute several factors to not improving: being a dad, work stress, second pregnancy, losing climbing partners, not making it outside this season, etc.. The big one though is a year long lingering A2 ring finger strain that I finally took 2 months off to let heal, 1 month being light hanging only (on top of a separated shoulder). I’m 2+ months post recovery and climbing decent, slight pain but much improved. I see an ortho this week. 

I struggle to do climbs I used to crush. I am constantly feeling weak or fog headed during climbing. I haven’t had a good climbing session (to my standards) in what feels like months, even before my break. 

I’m not sure if I need a more focused training plan, a trainer, supplemental exercises, better eating, or what. But every session I leave feeling like I’m just a bad climber. 

Anyone gone through this type of slump before? As I type it out, it’s clear I’m just going through life changes but climbing is my biggest hobby in life and I hate feeling down or angry all the time because of regression. Hopefully looking for some training tips or general suggestions to get my psych back and break the plateau. 

I’ll reply with more details in comments if needed. Cheers!
Concentric finger curls with tindeq I recently got turned onto using the tindeq and further more into trying out maximal concentric finger curls with a block secured to the ground. I did about 5 weeks of 1 day on day off. This worked out well because I was away on work for 4 of those weeks and the workout I was doing was super fast and easy to do while on the job. Originally I was doing it after my shifts but because my job is very forearm taxing I changed that up and did the workout during my shifts.

What I did was:
3sets of 3reps on each hand at maximal intensity   generally 2-3seconds of effort.

The first time I curled around 110lbs of force and by the end of the 5 weeks I was around low 170lbs approaching body weight

I recently got home and to see if there had been an improvement I tested one arm hangs on the beast maker 2000 smallest edge (15mm) and had a personal best of +25lbs 4 second hang on each arm. For a total load of 200lbs. Normally I can one arm the middle 20mm edge for 30seconds give or take 10seconds depending on the day.

Overall pretty interesting I'm going back to traditional one arm hangs but will for sure use this method in the future.
A guide to Periodization Training for Climbers A Guide to Periodization for Climbing (avoiding plataeus and overtraining)


Periodization - the application of planned phase changes and cycles in training to drive physical and metabolic change while reducing the likelyhood of overtraining.

Fancy definitions aside periodization is a way to set up your training to maximize your gains and avoid plateaus and overuse injuries. In this post I will explain the type of periodization, where they are optimal and applicable, and the shortfalls of each. This wil probably be a long post so sorry about that lol.

There are three main type of periodization: Linear Periodization, Non-linear periodization, and block periodization. 

LINEAR PERIODIZATION, also known as classic periodization was the first to be created and can often be seen in sports such as football where players start with a high volume of easier less sport specific training and progress to lower volume higher intensity and more specific training culminating in either a peaking phase or maintainence phase. This would look something like Endurance/capacity > hypertrophy > strength >power > peak/maintenance. However there are a few ways to arrange this such as having multiple alternating strenth and hypertrophy phases before moving on if there is a long pre season or the specific player require more muscle. 
So how is this applicable to climbing?  Well, to be honest linear periodization is less suited to climbing versus nonlinear periodization or block periodization, but it is the easiest to visual and can have some niche use cases. Linear Periodization typically has the highest peaking effect vs other types, however there can be a decline in whatever you are not currently working, such as during a power phase your endurance may start to wane. When applied to climbing the typical way to arrange your training would be in blocks of about 4 weeks going endurance>strength>power>a short power endurance phase > peaking phase which would be timed with a climbing trip. Each block of four weeks would be increasing in either intensity or volume (or both) week over week so week 2 is harder than 1, and 3 harder then 2, and then week 4 being a bit easier so you are recovered to start the next block. In practice this could be applied to weighted pullups where you simple add 5 pounds each week.

Drawbacks of this type of periodization are that you can sometimes see a decline in whatever energy system you are not currently working. The positives of this type of periodization are a higher theoretical peak which can be good for a trip in the future at a set date. It is also much easier to make steady year over year progress and you are less likely to get overtrained.


BLOCK PERIODIZATION 

The second type of periodization and perhaps my favorite. This type of periodization is similar to linear periodization in that you have a focus for each block, however instead of solely focusing on one thing ex. strength, you will also work your other energy systems at lower maintainence levels to avoid detraining them. To help visualize this you could think of a strength focus being 70% of your training being for the purpose of gaining strength, then 20% being power, and 10% being endurance, or in an endurance phase 70% endurance, 20% strength, 10% power. However these percents are fluid and can be changed to better fit your needs.
Just like linear periodization it's often best to trend from higher volume easier work to more intense, lower volume, and more sports specific work. An example of this could be endurance focus (as described previously), strength focus, and then power focus, with the option of doing a power endurance phase if a trip is coming up. Often times as climbers we do not want to gain much muscle mass, but if you feel you are lacking in the pulling muscles or in the shoulders then it could be put after the endurance phase.
Drawbacks to this type of training are that the weekly volume is often higher and thus the risk of overtraining is higher. In addition your peak will not be quite as high, however you will be much more well rounded which is very useful for climbers who do lead and boulder (or big wall) and for those who compete year round. The positives are that you are more well rounded, and it's less likely to bore you. With linear periodization it can be daunting or boring knowing that you will only be doing endurance for the next 4 weeks or so.

NONLINEAR PERIODIZATION 

The third and last type of periodization is nonlinear periodization. This is characterized by working all aspects of fitness at once. Generally you would work endurance, strength, and power equally within the week (and optionally hypertrophy). Due to the nature of this training blocks are generally much longer than 4 weeks. The variation comes throughout the week itself. For example Monday could be power, wednesday endurance, Friday Strength, and the repeat again startin on monday. And of course additional workouts can be added between if recovery allows. At a glance this type of periodization seems great however just like the other two there are drawbacks. The main drawback is that it can be hard to progress any one aspect of your climbing, meaning your endurance, strength, or power. This does not mean you cannot make gains, but you must be very intentional with your training to continually make gains year after year, and to avoid overtraining. Anecdotally this type of training seems best suited to beginners who do not need a very strong stimulus to make progress. The positives are that you will be very well rounded in all aspects of your climbing, and that it can be quite fun as you are never going long periods of time doing only one type of training.


TL;DR

Linear Periodization - Highest peak and lower likelyhood of overtraining, bu can detrain in whatever you aren't focusing, can get boring

Block Periodization - Fairly well rounded and still a decent peak, larger threat of overtraining 

Nonlinear periodization - Very well rounded and low risk of monotany, but does not excel at any one thing, worries with overtraining.
Critical Force is (probably) your ticket to sport climbing harder: napkin data analysis Based on data taken from some of the Lattice guys' research papers (Giles 2020 and 2019; links below), forearm Critical Force as a percentage of bodyweight (aka your 'all-day' rate) is a huge factor in sport climbing performance. CF%Bw is an incredibly strong correlation with climbing grade (R^(2) =.604) and the magnitude of improvement in CF%bw when going from 5.11- to 5.13+ is pretty massive (CF of 21.5%bw for 5.11- to 36.5%bw for 5.13+ which is a 70% increase)

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343601001\_An\_All-Out\_Test\_to\_Determine\_Finger\_Flexor\_Critical\_Force\_in\_Rock\_Climbers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343601001_An_All-Out_Test_to_Determine_Finger_Flexor_Critical_Force_in_Rock_Climbers)

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329814457\_The\_Determination\_of\_Finger\_Flexor\_Critical\_Force\_in\_Rock\_Climbers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329814457_The_Determination_of_Finger_Flexor_Critical_Force_in_Rock_Climbers)

In terms of measurable physical output vs climbing grade, this is the cleanest correlation I have seen (if you got another one though, hit me up). Body weight, height, pull-ups, max finger strength, etc are nowhere close. Some of the Power Company metrics for climbers\* are close in magnitude, like '7:3 repeaters time' and 'short reach foot-on campus time'; but since the time under load in these examples are similar to time to reach CF in the Giles 2020 article, Id argue underlying cause would be the CF%bw.

I'm gonna make a bold statement.... CF%bw to sport climbers = FTP/Kilo to cyclists. Its the same measurement in many ways (a sport-specific power over time relationship) and it should probably be treated with the same importance. 

So I converted the Giles 2020 PDF to data I could play with in excel:

&#x200B;

[Original](https://preview.redd.it/b1yodawzgomc1.jpg?width=374&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c508f6abec375316943065dd42c1364a19c52de)

&#x200B;

[excel conversion made with the implied data, pretty spot on I think](https://preview.redd.it/mghcpecygomc1.jpg?width=618&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d91c08e6be7aa1ba98586e00c640ecf826464205)

Given the significant variance within grades, I wanted to take a more statistically robust approach to explore the data by combining some grades in a somewhat logical order: 

[Interquartile range and &#37; increase tell an interesting story. Cant do much with the \>24 category with 3 data points though](https://preview.redd.it/zthhyykciomc1.png?width=870&format=png&auto=webp&s=682ce80daae62000bca16fb54ade72940480a762)

What stood out to me was how the % increase from each category was all over the place. So I sliced it along the other axis and used a Jenks natural breaks optimization to divide CF%bw into categories and make grade the dependent variable:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[pretty clean trend for at least 1 grade jump every \~7&#37; improvement. This time the median grade is jumpy obviously, i just flipped the dependent var. ](https://preview.redd.it/ua9vdpngkomc1.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=8357aa6ce0bb8ffaf73ea686d6c584f95c68cc30)

 Its just one part of the complex climbing equation; peak strength, flexibility, technique, route choice, etc all obviously play a role. Me personally though? I've been at this climbing thing a while (>10yrs) and when I FALL OFF its usually because I CANT HANG ON NO MORE. So how much harder should I hang on? 6-8% will probably bump me up a grade or two. 

And if you're below the 1st quartile in CF%bw for the grade you're attempting, you're probably at a disadvantage.

Ok so how to train it? So many articles/podcasts/training plans are out there, just pick one and stick with it for a good long time (like  >1.5 months). Personally, seeing how strength decays to CF in about 3 min, any plan that doesnt have reps of at least 5 min probably isnt ideal. 

&#x200B;

[hmm seems familiar...](https://preview.redd.it/tiua9phbyomc1.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=18a07fe61eb2c3f4ae135fc1d02e20e47afa9a9e)

&#x200B;

[...there it is. the percentage represents percentile of the individual measured. e.x. top 2&#37; of cyclists in red. Another thing to note is the relationship between 5 sec and 5 min across categories, strong people decay much more.](https://preview.redd.it/06f98xo31pmc1.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=27aabe9e05f622189222c2e8c9d511bf52ef45af)

Bit of a digression, but something to note is the relationship between 5 sec and 5 min across categories: strong people decay much more. Because they have huge, meaty thighs (forearms) full of fast-twitch type 1 muscle. Using sub 5 min data to extrapolate FTP (or CF) is gonna get messy

This data set is thousands of tests deep. 

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

other notes:

 \-1 arm CF is roughly 46.5%-48% of  2 arm CF. I think. 

\-a 'decent' 2 arm CF%bw seems to be >60%. I think. Im at 50% and shooting for 65%, which seems pretty achievable if you train for it. 

\-to do a test, you could follow the protocol in the 2019 paper (which is pretty grueling and takes a few hrs)

... or you could take a page from the 2020 paper and run a continuous set of 7:3s till your strength flattens in 156.9 ± 47.1 seconds. Instead of needing a fancy force gauge tho, just stand on a bathroom scale as you hang and record it with your phone (but feel free to set up an Arduino datalogger if you're so inclined). Your 1 arm CF WILL be less than your bodyweight, so it works fine. Bonus: you dont have to know your max hang strength, just hop on a scale and see what you pull after about 3 min of 7:3

P.S. I'm much more of an analysis guy than visualization guy, also I maybe a bit delirious from too much time in the data mine.  So if something isnt clear LMK

P.P.S Remus, call me. You forgot to reply to my last email :(

How would you maintain climbing fitness level if you only climbed once a week? I'm considering spending a few months focusing on an endurance sport, but I don't want to start from zero when I come back to bouldering "full time".

If you could only climb and train for climbing one day per week - no lifting or hangboarding on a different day - how would you spend that climbing day?

E.g. would you climb any limit boulders? Stick to flashable problems? Mostly board climb? Only do problems with straightforward beta? Hangboard? Try to get as much volume as possible?

My guess would be to do 80% flash grade problems, and 20% hard to limit problems. Maybe board climb every other week.

Seems like there's a minimum character limit, so here's a sample training plan:
Week a:
Warm up 20 mins
Climb 3 V3 gym problems, 2 min rest between attempts
Climb 4 V4-5 gym problems, 3 min rest between attempts
Climb 2 flashable (straightforward or I've seen the beta) v5-6 problems (max 3 tries, 5 min rest between attempts)
Project v7 problem for 20-30 mins

Week b:
Same thing but on the tension or kilterboard
Jedi Mind Tricks Ok, I get this sub is about training, and therefore we're going to talk about physical things most of the time. But it's getting really boring. Max hang here, one arm there, weighted pull-up on Sundays before my experimental dose of creatine, BLAH BLAH BLAH.

What are your mental tactics? How do you "try hard"? 

I think people conflate the answer to the latter with "trying a lot, really hard." Trying hard is not trying a lot - nor is it trying to perfectly optimize the number of attempts to preserve energy. It's something of a higher order. This sub is obsessed with quantities of effort, and I think there's a lot more that could be discussed about qualities of effort.

Let's hear stories about your zen wizardry; how you did something you truly didn't think you could; what you do with your brain, rather than your body, to float up the fooking blocks of life.

My break-through has been realizing that focusing 100% of my energy (and I truly mean 100/100) on my nasal breath and the visualization of the next move, rather than how my body feels on the current move, allows me to tap into the "holy shit I can't believe I just did that" well with much more consistency.
Wanted to share my rehab after an A2 Pulley total rupture (12 weeks) **Intro**

Nearly twelve weeks ago, on January 9th 2024, I completely ruptured my A2 pulley on my left ring finger while bouldering. After reading lots of horror stories about 6 to 12+ months of rehabilitation, I knew this would take some time to heal. Therefore I searched on the net for some rehabilitation or experiences other climbers made. But I mostly found testimonials of climbers that had only a strain or partial rupture, which is not as severe as a total rupture. That’s why I chose to share my rehab journey with you. Maybe it might help someone out there sharing the same fate as me.

**Video**

Coincidentally, a friend of mine captured the incident on video. You can even hear the sound of the pulley snapping. I tried to climb a V6 overhang, which forces you to crimp really hard with your left hand while cutting feet. I immediately felt a sharp pain and stopped all climbing.

If you're curious, I've already posted the video [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bouldering/comments/197ivre/wanna_know_how_an_a2_pulley_tear_sounds_listen/) then.

**Status post-rupture**

* there was no bow string visible
* there was no swelling within the first days, it accumulated later
* putting on pressure hurt as f\*\*\*
* mobility was not restricted at all
* even the slightest crimping did hurt

**Diagnosis**

Two days later, a total rupture of my A2 (Grade III) was confirmed by undergoing MRI and ultrasound.

Luckily, a good friend of mine is a general practitioner and an 8a/5.13b climber. He also specialized himself in treating climbing injuries. He printed me an adjustable pulley splint with a 3D printer, which I then wore 24 hours a day for the first eight weeks. This little gem allowed me to carry out daily activities safely and mostly without pain. 

**Climbing**

I had to stop all climbing activities for at least six weeks. Afterwards, I always taped my finger applying the H-Tape technique and used German Leucoplast Tape when climbing or doing strength training.

* Five weeks post-injury: I tried to do some easy top rope climbing by stretching away the injured finger while climbing. But this didn’t work at all and I quickly rejected my stupid idea. 
* Seven weeks post-injury, I went climbing again. I just did an easy, vertical 5.9 and a slab 5.10a in lead. No pain at all. I tried to avoid half crimps and just climbed with an open hand.
* Eight weeks post-injury:, I tried some indoor lead climbing. I could climb vertical routes, dihedrals and slabs up to 5.10c with only little pain (2-3 on a scale from 1-10) around the injured area. The pain went away a few minutes after the climb completely each time, which was okay my doc told me.
* Ten weeks post-injury: I managed to do a steep 5.10c outdoors where you have to use layback technique and an old school, sandbagged 5.10d route with a steep 6B/V4 boulder start (bad underclings, shitty sloper, athletic moves). I was able to climb it a few times without pain. I even accidentally used the half crimp sometimes, but always with appropriate foot placements.
* Twelve weeks post-injury: Today, I went indoor bouldering for the first time again. Fortunately, I was able to flash nearly every boulder up to 6B+/V4 and managed to do some 6C/V5s. I could climb overhangs up to 30°, did some dynos to jugs and used slopers/pinches/jugs/comfy ledges without any pain. I still avoided to use the half crimp as good as possible and walk-by routes that require to  crimping excessively. I could hang on the 20 mm beastmaker edge with an open hand grip pain free again! I'm not sure how much maximum strength I've lost within the twelve weeks, but I estimate it was not that much.  
Applying pressure to the injured area still hurts a little bit. While climbing, I don't feel any pain at all anymore. I guess crimping, pockets and finger-stressing boulders beyond 6C/+V5 will still take some time. But hey, I'm pretty happy that I'm able to climb again after this little time.

**My training beside climbing within the 12 weeks**

* **Finger Rehab:** I did not do any specific finger exercises (rice bucket, etc) beside climbing up to week 8. Then I started with block pulls. I used an open hand, 3 finger drag in repeater style. Protocol: Lift weight for 7 seconds, rest 3 seconds. Repeat 5 times. This counts as one set. Then you take 60 seconds rest. I did 5 sets in total per session. I started with 10 kg / 22 lbs and slowly worked myself up to 20 kg at the moment. Did this three times a week with at least a day off between training days. 
* **Pulling exercises:** I usually train weighted chin-ups and front levers twice a week in addition to climbing. Due to the injury, I couldn’t even hang from a bar or rings for the first ten weeks. That’s why I experimented a little. I found that [Rope Lat Pulldowns](https://youtu.be/7neTy_9zbjg?si=nrQR8b4K_HbkI0D8&t=31) helped me a lot to keep most of my pulling strength and didn’t cause me any pain. I found it the most pleasant if I'd only grip the rope with my thumb, digit and middle finger, creating kind of a circle with them. This takes any pressure off your ring (or injured) finger and still allows you to move a fair amount of weight.
* **Pushing exercises:** Standing dumbbell military press and ring pushups worked well for me and didn’t cause any pain. 
* **Leg, Shoulder Stability and Core** exercises were also no big deal.
* **Generalized aerobic training:** I used the opportunity to increase my generalized aerobic training frequency. I did three to four runs per week at a moderate intensity (about 40 km / 25 miles in total each week). This helped me to lose 3 kg / 6,5 lbs of weight, which was mostly body fat. I'm around 90 kg / 200 lbsat the moment.

**Nutrition**

I neither took collagen nor other special supplements. I follow a well-executed plant-based diet since 6 years.

**Reasons the injury happened**

Honestly, I don’t know why, but I have some theories.

I increased my max hangs on the 20 mm edge pretty quickly from August 2023 until November 2023 by + 40 kg / 90 lbs, starting with bodyweight only in August. I did the 7-53 max hang protocol 1-2 times a week. I had no pain prior to climbing, but maybe I had accumulated some micro-traumata. With 94 kg / 210 lbs at that time, at a height of 184 cm / 6 ft, I consider myself also pretty heavy for a climber.

I usually started my limit boulder days with a brief warm-up and the 7-53 max hang protocol before climbing. This primes my muscles and fingers for boulders at my limit very well. The day I ruptured my pulley, I ditched the max hangs due to lack of time. Nevertheless, I did some warm-up boulders beforehand, but it might be possible that my body was used to the intense „warm-up“ already, missed it and let my pulley commit suicide.

Maybe cutting feet while crimping the hell out of such a shitty ledge was not the best option. But I didn't find another solution. Anyway.

**Final words**

I hope this post may help someone out there in the future. If you suffer from an injury, **do not give up and try to train around it as good as possible.** There are plenty of options. Also, getting MRI/Ultrasound asap is critical imho. I can also recommend getting a **finger splint a LOT.** 

All in all I’m happy that I used the time to shed down some body fat and that I could keep most of my finger strength and fitness.

How to not climb hard Since I started climbing I have always had the mentality of climbing at my limit or above and it has done wonders for my climbing but not my body. I didn’t find out about how to prevent injuries till I had them. In the past couple months while I have been climbing harder then ever and close to accomplishing a big goal of mine I’ve had a never ending cycle of being sick and injured. While some of this can be attributed to bad luck most of it is from overtraining and always pushing my limit. I’ve decided for the next month I’m going to dumb down my climbing to climbs that are easy for me just so my body can recover from the abuse I’ve put it through. The only issue is I’m having a really hard time doing climbs that are easy because I’ll do all of the climbs in the gym that are V-Flash and under. Repeating the same climbs every session gets really boring and after every session I don’t feel accomplished at all. Any tips on how to take it easy with climbing for a month and not lose all of my psych because it’s becoming really hard to even want to climb.
The Seasonal Switch to Real Rock: What Changes? Every year, for >10 years, my friends and I always need a few outdoor trips to feel good on real rock again after gym climbing all winter.

I doubt its nerves because we've been doing it so long and know our local crag very well. I doubt its fitness either, we put in the mileage 2-4 days a week in the gym. 

I have some guesses (because of course I do):

More balance, less friction- local crags are granite and limestone: compared to gym plastic, it feels like ice skating at first. Foot choice is huge i think; one foot at a time on less-than-perfect jibs, basically doing slow pistol squats to explore hold options.

Route reading- holds are harder to spot, especially feet; I'll catch myself spreading my feet too wide to get the biggest foot jibs I can find.

Time on route-  indoor lead routes take us 2.5min (easy/warmup) to 3.5min (harder) while a shorter outdoor route with draws hung takes 7-8min. Longer routes with no draws is easily  >10min

I think its hard for plastic to simulate the lock-off>test holds>balance act you have to do on limestone/granite. I dont think there would be as much of a seasonal learning curve if we were climbing high-friction sandstone pockets like in Red River Gorge, but slippy limestone with 'mystery holds' requires a slower approach.

Does anyone else feel the same way, have any more guesses, or more data on outdoor leading time?
I took your advice, the Crux app is free for home walls now Hey everyone. I made a post 2 months ago about the spray wall app that my partner and I have been building for the last year.

The main feedback we've been getting was about the pricing scheme and monetization model we chose for home walls. So we decided to double back and make our app free for home wall users :)

If you missed the first post, the app lets you set and catalog spray wall climbs. It's like Stokt, except:

- It's 100% free for home walls
- We automatically extract holds from photos using AI, so you don't need to get us to reprocess images when you move or add holds.
- You can save beta videos on climbs

We also have a paid product for commercial spray walls which is how we're hoping to make money moving forward. We already have a small set of gyms on board.

This is what the wall scanning looks like: https://i.imgur.com/1FrtUnz.gif

If you try it out on your wall, please let me know what you think. You can download the app here: https://www.cruxapp.ca/homewalls
My honest thoughts on Charlie Schreiber as a first coach Hey y’all I thought I’d share my thoughts as a first time user of a coach/training program to hopefully guide others on their decision to get a coach and/or who to go with. Obviously keep in mind this is one person’s experience with one coach, and no other relative experience to go off of. That said, I’ve been climbing and training for 5-6years and I notice there really isn’t too much out there in regards to thoughts surrounding coaching outside of the glowing reviews from testimonials on a website. My training plan went from the beginning of 2024 through the beginning of march for a 9 week plan. 

Background and training goals: climbing v8 outside for ~2years, done multiple in a session, flashed my first v7 beginning of 2024. Most of my climbing has been bouldering focused, but summer 2023 I had my first extended sport trip and managed to climb my first 13a and 5.12 onsite. Current goals are sending v10, and (eventually) climbing 14a. 

My Experience with Charlie and his plan:

I went with Charlie Schreiber for 2 reasons:
1. His plans were some of the most reasonable I found with video analysis and didn’t require a huge commitment (I thought a 9 week program would be a good starting point with the option to continue longer) 
2. Recommendations from a friend who said he learned a lot from him on his first round of coaching. He also coaches climbers virtually at a very high level like V15/5.14+

With these two things in mind I went with the paradigm elite program for 9 weeks (coaching with check ins and video analysis) for $500. 

How it went: Overall, I have mixed feelings on the plan and process, there was a lot I really liked, but also plenty that didn’t work for me. Your mileage may vary. 

The plan started with an intake phone call where I chatted with Charlie about goals, strengths, weaknesses, where we like to focus our climbing, projecting, how often you train, gym resources, kinda typical stuff that he then uses to build your plan. My first positive aspect is that he is PSYCHED for his clients. Super encouraging and definitely puts you in the mindset that you can achieve your goals. I guess any coach probably would be but it was definitely a good first impression. 

After about a week he comes back with a plan and you have another phone call to go over it and I had a little bit of pause as one of the first parts of the warmup was slab wall work. My gym doesn’t have a slab wall, and I told him this in our intake interview (my gym is a “board room” with two system boards, two spray walls, hang boards, weights, and a few machines). His response was to “try and get out to another gym when you can” when the closest gym with any slab is 45 min to an hour away. Whatever, he said not to worry about it too much so I didn’t really get too worked up. Maybe a i didn’t communicate it enough, my bad. 

The actual plan was super detailed, had reps, sets, effort levels for every exercise for every week, and most had links to videos for proper form. Overall, nice and detailed no problem. 

The actual plan, once I got into the thick of it, maybe wasn’t right for me. It was ~5 days in the gym with one rest day before 4 days on. Granted most of this wasn’t climbing but the workouts were still not trivial, and I often found myself just being so tired that even on my climbing days I was just so wrecked it made trying to do anything close to a limit bouldering session feel like a bit of a joke. I brought my concerns up to Charlie and he said to reduce my hangboarding as it’s likely my fingers that weren’t able to handle it. I specifically said muscular fatigue and soreness felt like they were holding me back. I think his experience coaching higher level climbers holds him back here as it almost seems like recovery was never really a thought in his head, outside of fingers and tendons. 

Video analysis: based on my experience, the analysis was not worth it. I feel like I barely got anything more than “turn your left knee out” maybe “try this move with a higher left foot” but I really was disappointed with the lack of reasoning or detail in the responses. I’ve never had a coach before but it’s not my first time analyzing movement from video, I want to know WHY turning the leg was better, not just that it will make sending easier. It seems primary feedback was to send the climb, not to become a better climber. 

Overall I found communication… challenging with Charlie. Obviously people have their own lives and are busy but I found I was having to text him in order to check in or get any real communication going. My friend who recommended him had weekly phone calls with him so I guess I was expecting that but sometimes it felt like pulling teeth to have an actual conversation with him. It really goes back to the idea of sending the climb, not becoming a better climber. 

This is getting long so I’ll leave it here but I’ll reply to comments as best I can so ask away. There’s more to my story but it wasn’t as useful, and were minor points relative to what I posted. Hopefully this helps some of y’all in looking for a coach.
Review of Dave Macleod/Altitude Climbing's Online Technique Course TLDR at bottom.

*Disclaimer: My mindset has always been about becoming a better climber through any and all means. Seeing how this course wasn't made for climbers like myself, I may find it a bit underwhelming compared to newer climbers. But the content is no doubt very high quality! I expand on this later, but if you're new with cash to spare it's a decent investment.*

**Introduction**
The course is split into 4 modules, each containing 5-15 subchapters of paragraphs and accompanying video commentary/climbing from Dave. There is also
3.5 hours of videos of Dave coaching 3 climbers of differing abilities. And a pdf of questions to ask yourself when reviewing your climbing ("Where/how did I use my thumb? How does your foot position change through each stage of execution? Etc..)

Altitude claims the course is meant for the "intermediate" climber who needs guidance or has plateaud, and vaguely suggests a grade range of V2-5 and 5.11-5.12ish. But they are also confident that "climbers up to 5.14 will benefit from this course." I certainly agree with the former, not so much the latter, but I also understand that's just marketing.

The goal of the course, per Dave in the introduction: "...is for you to notice, understand, and be able to use a wider repertoire of movements that make climbing feel easier."

So how do we work through this course to reach that goal? "The key to learning movement technique quickly lies in cultivating the habit of taking enjoyment from the problem-solving element in climbing." Basically, creating a self-sustaining feedback loop of technique refinement as you climb, constantly asking yourself "why did that work/go wrong?" This can clearly be a lot, and so they place much emphasis on developing this mechanism for technical learning. 

I''ll go into a little more detail on that last part later, as it pertains to Module 4, but let's get into what each Module offers.


**Module 1: Making Hard Moves Easy**

In other words: Movement Basics 101. I found this section rather lacking to be frank. Maybe it's my level of climbing, but "When to outside/inside flag?" and "When to straight arm/lock?" are not questions you should be asking if you're paying nearly $200 to get better at climbing. To me, those are questions you ask to your crusher friend when you just bought your first pair of shoes. 

Now I get it, everyone would prefer their crusher friend to be Dave MacLeod. But the majority of the information covered in this section is like a technique course offered by a gym, or obtained for free by hanging with casual climbers for a week. 

However, the major pro to this Module is its comprehensiveness. You may, as a casual climber of 6 months - 3 years, understand some nuances of climbing shoes, the idea of opposition, why you should sometimes hang on straight arms and sometimes pull-through. But you may not know 'how' and 'why' for these things. If you merely climb for fun, or even for a little bit more than fun but don't consume any training content or YouTube tutorials, this module will certainly have new information for you.

It's clear Dave/Altitude wanted to be comprehensive and appeal to beginners, so as a result this stuff is practically a necessity to include in the course. And while you may find a good tip or two in here, the real meat and potatoes lies in other modules. 


**Module 2: Executing Your Moves Perfectly**

In other words: Generating (and Cancelling) Momentum. This module reads like an introduction to intermediate climbing and climbing on boards. You gotta move fast sometimes. You gotta move slow sometimes. What is body tension? Who is body tension? 

If you are a newer climber, and trend towards static, controlled climbing but want to learn why doing the opposite might be a good idea, this module is for you. 

If you are a newer climber, and trend towards jumpy, powerful climbing but want to learn why doing the opposite might be a good idea, this module is for you. 

If you've already involved yourself with board climbs and slabs likewise, and have climbed consistently with intent to improve for more than a year, I don't think you'll benefit much here. 

There is a rather nice section on the elusive "body tension" that does well in defining and elucidating the term. But similar to the last section, while you may glean some new information, it's nothing you couldn't have eventually intuited or picked up on from others yourself over time.


**Module 3: Expand Your Technique Repertoire**

In other words: Climbing Vocabulary 101. This short and sweet module lists several moves (dropknee, heel/toe hooks/cams, kneebars, active flagging etc..) and explains them through text and video demonstrations. 

I think I would have appreciated this consolidated list of movement when I was a newer climber. There's nothing groundbreaking, and it's all stuff you can easily find separately on the Internet, but Dave's way of explaining is enthralling enough to be useful. You may know some or all of the information in a certain section here, but are likely to find a good couple tips on techniques you're less familiar with (the subtle self-kneebar anyone?) 


**Module 4: Learn Technique Faster**

In other words: You Buy The Course For This Module (and the coaching videos). 

Remember the "What" and the "How" from the introduction? This module answers those questions. It opens with a formula for technical learning (think total volume of climbing with intentional practice), expands on how to address the components of the formula, then offers tips in assessing your own/others' movement, and finishes with how to move forward in the typical gym climber environment. 

While again this is nothing groundbreaking, it's a good consolidation of information. Dave's own channel [has a nice video about this topic] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdSTJBe8Fd4), and others have been made [such as this interview with Will Anglin and Matt Jones.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tog_ogRtJGE)


**Coaching Videos**

This is also what you buy the course for. 3+ hours of Dave coaching three different climbers is pretty hard to beat when online video reviews can cost $50+/hr. For me, having spent lots of time on /r/climbharder and consuming climbing content, I wouldn't have gleaned much. But if you've never done or engaged with anything like this, it will be very worth your while.


**Conclusion**
The problem I see with improving at climbing, like actually being a *better* climber, lies in how nebulous progression in this sport is. When we can't even agree on measures for how difficult climbs are (grades), and have barely a drop of science backing certain training information, newer climbers are left wondering how to improve so many things at once. They see the hangboards, the spray walls, the Moonboard, the workout areas, the yoga studio. They listen to PowerCompany and The Nugget. They watch Hoopers Beta and Hannah Morris and Emil and everyone else. They hear from the local crusher about 'never training' or the inverse 'hangboard ASAP'. They peruse /r/climbharder and other subs daily. "Is that really what I need to do to get better?" they ask.

I think that there is no substitute for pure experience. *Lots* of experience. V10/5.14 doesn't automatically make you a good climber; it certainly didn't make me one. So I don't believe that paying upwards of $200 for access to text and videos will make you a better climber, because you can't spend your way through experience. Dave kinda says this implicitly through the course. His job was to get you to coach yourself. If you do your due diligence, you *will* get better. If cash isn't a problem and shortcutting that information is more worthwhile to you, then the course will be fantastic. Otherwise, save it.


**TLDR:** What this course does best is consolidation and expedition of information. If that is worth the price to you, then great! I'd wager for most people who have more than a couple years of consistent climbing experience, they're better off putting that money towards a coach and their time towards research. If the cash isn't breaking the bank however, and you don't have consistent circles of information to improve your climbing with, the course is absolutely worth it. 

**TLDRTLDR:** Pretty decent if you're inexperienced and never spend time thinking about movement. Otherwise, in-person coaching for the money.
First home wall in Pakistan? Started climbing indoors last year in Germany and fell in love with it instantly. But while planning my vacations back in Pakistan, I had to face the fact that wouldn't be able to find any indoor climbing gyms here. What to do? Let's try building my own!

This is my first big building project so was definitely a bit nervous! But thanks to all of the amazing tutorials out there and references, I was able to achieve a design. However to make it easily adjustable, my father had
a plan of his own! Building the frame out of 14 gauge steel!! The whole construction became incredibly easy!

Size: 4' x 8' (I had lack of space but could be made into 8' x 8' easily by adding another plywood to the frame.

I made the holds out of old Oakwood pieces I found at a local scrap store. Since I did not have a saw machine of any kind, I used chisels to shape the positive holds before using an angle grinder with 40 grit disc to smooth everything out.

Currently, the board is at a 15° angle but would move it to 25° to see how I do.

Repeaters Increased My Overall Max Hang TLDR: After a serious injury, I decided to train my fingers and mobility and have already seen great results. I focused on repeaters and my 20mm max hangs increased from ~145lbs for 5 seconds in January 2024 to ~169lbs for 4 seconds May 2024. I'll post an update in about 4-6 weeks after a few runs at max hangs and continued training.

For context, I (33F) have been bouldering for around 6 years. About 3 years ago, I partially tore my labrum and developed severe tendinosis in multiple areas which hampered my ability to train my fingers without risking additional injury. Prior to my recent accident, I had topped my first indoor V8 boulder and was within 1 move of several outdoor V6s. I was ready for the Spring send season. 

Then I fell. While trying to top out an awkward V5, I had a bad fall and severely sprained both ankles at the same time. X-rays showed there was also an avulsion fracture on my outer left ankle and the doctor confirmed that I likely pulled several ligaments around the foot and ankle joint.

The doctor also concluded that even if only a single ankle had been sprained, it would be at least 12 weeks recovery time, which meant minimal to no impact and no climbing. Since I messed up both ankles, it would take substantially longer to recover. 

Since I couldn't climb, I resolved to train my fingers until my ankles recovered. The shoulders felt great and I had been wanting to do a finger strengthening regimen, and I was homebound. It was perfect. 

Back in January, I had started a max hang protocol that was abandoned in favor of climbing harder routes. The previous max hovered around between 140-145lbs on the 20mm edge and a bodyweight repeater max of ~30s (7s on 3s rest) per set on the 20mm edge. While those numbers were disappointing at the time, they also provided a great framework for this new routine. 

The routine focused on hypertrophy, so I'd have more forearm mass to work with. 
I started the first few sessions on the 25mm edge, holding for 7s and resting for 5s, as many reps as I could between 6 sets.

Initial total hang times were about 5:10 between six sets of 7 second hangs. After a few sessions, I settled on six sets of 10 second hangs with 5 second rests. The goal was to reach a full 6 minutes, and if that was not fulfilled, I would do three density hangs of 20 seconds on the 20mm edge at the end of my session. 

I kept this up until I consistently hung for a total time of 5:40, after about four weeks. At which point I switched to the 20mm edge and followed the same protocol for another two weeks. My max time under tension on the 20mm was 5:55 on 4/30. 

I then took a weeklong break before testing my maxes. This time I tested my max strictly on the 20mm ledge for 7 seconds and was able to successfully hold at least 163.6 lbs and failed at 168.6 lbs for 4 seconds. Bodyweight repeaters changed my overall hanging weight from 126% to 146% of bodyweight.
DIY no-hang setup I was interested in exploring no-hangs, but not in dropping $150+ on a Tindeq just to see how I felt about it, so I wanted to share my DIY setup.

First I bought a cheap crane scale for $20. I tried just using a sling around my foot, but the scale’s screen was pointed away from me so I couldn’t read the force.

From the Tyler Nelson video I watched, it seems like you can either hang it above and pull down (harder to isolate) or anchor it below and pull up (either isolating the fingers, or including the legs…as finger strength is still the limiting factor).

So I figured I could anchor it below, bought a little pulley and an eye hook for $10 and threw this little platform together from scrap wood and hardware.

For now I’m just using paracord to tie it together which probably isn’t ideal as it has some stretch to it (I think?) — it would probably work better with metal cable. Also I’m sure the pulley impacts the measurement slightly..oh well!

Next thing to make is a little 20mm edge, as the Metolius Rock Ring is really bulky and annoying for this purpose.

Maybe it inspires other folks or ya’ll have ideas on how to improve it!
Lessons Learned From My Hardest Projects Over the past couple years, I've transitioned from a grade chasing mindset to skill acquisition and experience-focused climbing. This change has largely been mental, but of course affects what my priorities are and what I spend time getting better at. My ability to find success on Vhard (without getting metrics-stronger or training) skyrocketed recently. Not only has this helped me overcome limiting expectations set on myself, it's led me to enjoy the projecting process much more. I'm more compelled to try Vmax-Vmax+3 stuff without any attachment to performance. Sometimes I surprise myself on these boulders. Sometimes I very expectantly get shit on. C'est la vie!

This is a short compilation of some lessons from my V11-15 projects over the past year and a half or so. I noticed some common themes that would emerge from climb to climb, and some of them have been floating around in my head for a while. If nothing else, this is just getting ideas for myself written out. Obviously, this all applies to bouldering, I don't really project sport climbs.

In a semi-sorted order of the projecting process:

-----------

**1. Don't write off a climb based on how you think you'll perform.**

If I had a dollar for every boulder I thought of as "anti-style" and then cruised, or "I'll totally flash this" and then fell on for three sessions, I'd own a Mercedes Sprinter. Two of my hardest sends are steep compression rigs where your body gets pumped before your fingers and your footwork is extremely important. If you watch me climb or ask me however, my strengths lie in jumpy, fingery board-style boulders that are short and sweet.

It is often those unexpectedly workable boulders that we can learn the most from. Yeah I can feel good about putting down a double digit quickly if it resembles a Kilter climb. But what that does for my movement repertoire compared to a 16-session epic, where I have to know *every little detail* to even have a chance at sending, is miniscule. Don't write off climbs because of preconceived notions about yourself. Try everything. When was the last time you put 100 attempts into a single move?

--------------------

**2. Know when to switch from thinking to feeling, and vice versa.**

I'm a strong advocate for video analysis and critical thinking about one's movement, as evident from my history on this sub. But there comes a point where you can only rewatch a video so many times, only visually notice so many things, that you lose the forest for the trees. Over-analysis may just work to your detriment, supplanting incredibly helpful sensory inputs while you're climbing with the idea that you can think your way through a crux.

I do want to tread lightly here, because I believe most people think *far too little* about their own movement. I get a ton of “I don’t knows” when coaching friends and asking them questions about what just happened. While I have thousands of clips of myself climbing saved, less than 50 of those are from the past year. Doing loads of self-analysis helped until it didn't. There came a point where I was analyzing more than I was climbing. Once I hit that threshold, I forgot what it was like to simply exist in my body on the wall.

I sent my hardest boulder this season when I stopped worrying about *my hips were 2 inches left on this attempt I stuck the move, and my heel was 30 degrees further clockwise when I fell*. I instead had several sessions in a row existing in the moment on the wall, reflecting when I fell, and then resting before trying again. Over the course of just 8 sessions, I felt like I learned more about myself and that climb than dozens of hours of video review on a 16-session project.

This of course was because I trended towards over-analysis of myself on video. You may very well be the opposite and never watch yourself climb. Whatever you do, switch it up and try the other method.

-----------

**3. Specify your warmup to your project, and standardize it.**

Pretty self-explanatory but hard for me to embrace. If your project has a left heel hook that you ride for four hand moves, and then a very technical left heel-toe cam that you ride through the crux, you should really warm up your left leg. Do it off the wall. Hold the positions on the wall. Do some crazy hip opening drills on the pads. Apply this to whatever specific thing your project exposes in you.

This has been really crucial for me as a young strong dude. I'm sure some older and more experienced folks are rolling their eyes and saying "duh". But let's be real, most people here (or in the gym) are probably in their 20s or younger and can get away without it.

The real meat and potatoes here is creating a standard for which you can measure yourself from session to session. On my project this season, I could very quickly know if I was warm or not, rested or not, based on a routine I developed. This will differ from climb to climb of course. The way you warmup for a techy, heel-hook focused squeeze climb will vastly differ from the way you warmup for a powerful overhang jumping between crimps.

-----------

**4. Give send burns early.**

This is one of my tactics some people think is silly but I find quite helpful and confidence-boosting. I like to give "send burns" even if I haven't done all the moves (assuming of course the crux isn't at the intro). This A) helps drill the less consequential bits into muscle memory, thereby helping you move more efficiently when you get to the crux, and B) reinforces that you can do this climb, because at least you're doing moves.

I'm a strong believer that most people can send harder than they think they can. For me, doing moves even on easy sections helps trick my brain into thinking "maybe this Vmax WILL go." At worst, you learn the climb a little better, at best, you send your project surprisingly early!

-----------

**5. Sometimes you get lucky when you have success.**

Ever stick a move once and then can't repeat it for years? Does that mean you've regressed? Or did you maybe just get a little lucky and have the perfect go?

I have a long-term project in Hueco that I did the crux on years ago. 100 tries, a couple years, coaching, and way too much video analysis later, I still haven't done the move again. Have I regressed? Not at all! I know I'm way better and way stronger than I was when I did the move. I can do the intro better, I climb harder, I can *almost* do the move better 100% of the time compared to years ago.

It's hard seeing yourself "unsend" a boulder or move. It's even harder when you take that too seriously. It's okay to have a surprisingly perfect try that doesn't result in continued success. You at least have the knowledge now that you CAN do it.

-----------

**6. Use and abuse technology.**

The obvious upside to Instagram, digital guidebooks, video beta and the like is saving time. Three climbing days on a yearly trip and might lose one to rain? Study that fucking beta. Visualize, visualize, visualize. *Climb the boulder before you even get to try the boulder.* Map out your zones and backup plans with a guidebook. Bring portable heaters in the cold and fans in the heat. Brush and brush some more. 

Technology is tactics just as much as the projecting process, sleep, and mental game are tactics. Know the tools available to you so that you can know the climb better. This got me up my first V10 before I had even done an 8 or 9.

-----------

**7. Conversely, learn how to climb without technology.**

Technology got me up V10 but it didn’t make me a V10 climber. Similar to my video beta rant, technology redirects attention away from yourself and onto something external. There will come a time when you don’t have a guidebook to lead you to the boulder in the woods, which doesn’t have video beta online, which is too far to hike in a fan and spotlights, which you don’t even know is safe enough to solo sesh with two pads. Getting on top of a boulder like that when you only abuse technology, even if it’s far below your Vmax, is going to be extremely difficult.

As often as you pick up the guidebook and online beta, put it back down and go without. A crucial part of getting better at climbing is having an intimate understanding of yourself and the rock and how you uniquely interact with it. Video beta doesn’t tell you why you can’t do the heel hook everyone does, that’s something you need to feel for yourself. Develop a feedback loop of questioning yourself, iterate on the successes, and you’ll go far.

-----------

**8. Pro climber beta is useless to non-pros.**

I don’t just mean pro in the V14+ range, I mean anyone who regularly climbs at a level far above your own. Watching a V7 climber campus jugs on an overhang is useless to a V1 climber who needs to keep their feet on. Watching Drew Ruana heel hook to near statically get through the crux of The Game is useless for me who has to toe down and yard for the next hold; I don’t have a decade+ of experience doing incredibly technical heel hooks. I need to find my own mechanism for success that doesn’t rely on having decades of high level climbing experience, because that’s not me as a climber.

This is not to say you can’t glean useful information from more experienced climbers; they are better than you after all. But I will keep repeating the point that it’s about what YOU can do to find success. Not other people. The more you use yourself as a source of information, the better that information gets.

-----------

**9. Know yourself.**

Which leads to this point. In my opinion the #1 thing you can do to improve as a climber: know yourself. What you train, how you train, what climbs you try, how you determine progress, how you find beta, who you climb with, sending boulders. These are all predicated on knowing yourself. The better you know yourself, the better you can approach these things to further improvement.

Knowing yourself is very hard. The more time you spend relying on external tools, the less time you spend getting comfortable in your own body on the wall and your head off the wall. This is why I think past a certain intermediate climbing level, you should forego video beta and do lots of climbing relying on yourself. Then explore going back to video beta when you’re stuck.

There’s not much to say beyond that. It takes years. I don’t even know how much I don’t know at this point. All I know is that the more I learn, the more I realize I know nothing about climbing.

-----------

**10. Embrace the suck.**

“If it was easy, it wouldn’t be hard.” (I’m aware for some people here this is preaching to the choir like my warmup note.)

Gym climbing, and especially board climbing, makes it very easy to avoid the suck. Can’t do this V6? Just go to the V6 that suits you around the corner. Stuck on this benchmark below your max? Swipe right and flash the soft one of the next grade!

In my experience, most people don’t know what it’s like to actually be stuck. Or even project. A climb that takes more than 1 session is a “hard project”, and not finding beta in 30 minutes is “stuck on this move.” 

This is why I also believe most climbers can send harder than they think they can; they’ve never put in proper effort to a Vmax climb. I don’t think it’s just my gym environment either, because I see this all over climbing media and the internet. This is also why outdoor bouldering is a fantastic way to improve. Sit your ass down under an impossible-feeling boulder (not too impossible of course) and siege it for 2 years, I bet you do better than you’d think.

The hardest part of embracing the suck for me was letting go of expectation and entitlement. You climb a good amount of Vx with your limit at Vy, and you may feel entitled to sending whatever Vx you come across. Then you make excuses about why you can’t send a certain Vx, never realizing it’s a great opportunity to make you a better climber, and instead find the next Vx you can do quickly or Vy that suits you. 

I had to fall in love with failure and it made all the difference. There’s a reason every top post on this sub in some way or another mentions detachment from ego, or not getting caught up in grades, or embracing the suck. Learn how to have fun sucking and you’ll have even more fun when you inevitably send.
Exploring Affordable Endurance (for moderate/intermediate climbers) [Home wall prototypes](https://preview.redd.it/rwekkr19tl4d1.jpg?width=981&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b49dc353d77fd6c4683ed2aace0d9579a211e53)

TLDR - my current mini-wall (right) has been the most effective home training device I've built, because as a moderate level climber, I can actually use it with zero excuses or physical limits and build climbing specific endurance - so when I go climbing, at the gym or crag, I can enjoy it at my moderate level, even if it's been weeks or months.  
  
Maybe the average r/climbharder person won't relate, but I'm in agreement with this reddit's wiki about training that "those climbing at a moderate level (≤5.11+, V4/5) are advised *against using the hangboard* \[and\] simply climbing regularly will improve performance faster and with lower risk of injury." It also mentions regarding board climbing that "this style of climbing is stressful on the tendons; start slowly, limit session frequency and duration, and prioritize recovery through food, sleep and adequate rest."

When I started climbing in the early 1980s - there were no hangboards, system boards, or climbing gyms. But living in Bend, I was less than an hour from Smith Rock. Eventually my brother, our friend, and I (age 16-18) scraped together enough cash for a few nuts and hexes, oval carabiners, a goldline rope, and 1" webbing for harnesses so we could make the occasional pilgrimage to Smith and start... simply climbing. Flash forward about 5 years and we were starting to become aware we were at the epicenter of the birth of sport climbing in the US - or at a minimum the ground-up vs hangdogging ethic wars. We'd also been introduced to Alan Watts via Chris Grover, who we bouldered with at Awbrey Meadows (sadly locked within a golf course for the past 20+ years).   
  
1985 is when my brother's and my own climbing story diverge. I was now married, with our first of eleven kids, and trying to figure out how to run the family business. My brother was spending more and more time at Smith, with Alan, Chris, and the Metolius crew...simply climbing. I wanted to be climbing but spent most of my day answering motorcycle performance questions. I was a parrot who knew how to tell you about jetting your carburetor, but didn't have a legitimate mechanical bone in my body.    
  
This was around the same time we started reading about comps in Arco, Italy. Having been gymnasts, and seeing an article in Climbing magazine about some guys that built a 4-sided box with some wood edges, the idea to build a standard climbing wall apparatus took root. By June 1986 The Wall was advertised in Climbing Magazine, the first commercial wall in the US. This would be followed in 1987 by Roks Bouldering Bloks, the first modular holds in the US (sparked by Alan bringing back a hold from Europe and all of us thinking "this is way cooler than wooden blocks.") The Metolius Simulator, the first hangboard in the US, also came out around this time, and for a few weeks, I had the first prototype -- a super ugly blue and yellow block of textured resin with an assortment of fairly heinous edges and pockets. While I was trying to start a company and feed my family, my brother Sean Olmstead, was putting up new routes at Smith, including Churning in the Wake (5.13a).   
  
By early 1988 I'd built walls and holds for the 2nd gym in the US - the Portland Rock Gym, followed by most of the surface panels and holds for the Snowbird World Cup for Jeff Lowe, followed by failed partnerships with Dan Goodwin (Sport Climbing Systems), Dale Bard (Vertical Concepts), and eventually joined Alan at Entre Prises USA from 1994-1996, but ended up on the wrong side of an international power struggle and left the now decade old industry, and Oregon, and ended up in Arizona.   
  
The quest for a small, affordable, portable, storable, reconfigurable, and fun wall system didn't leave me however, and I've built a few different prototypes over the years, some of them very similar to the Moonboard, which would fulfill all our early dreams of shared problems, but is too big and expensive for most climbers and most homes. For several years I thought I was close to having something with a 2x3' panel system making a 6x12 wall (or as small as 4x9 maybe). But the reality of almost any wall is that it's just a bit too big for most spaces, or an individual to reconfigure on their own, or outside the budget of most climbers. And the Cragwall had so many possible variations that trying to develop a few standards was beyond my energy, even if my family enjoyed certain configurations from time to time. Eventually though, setting routes or tightening holds, or the weather, or getting people together to reconfigure it, were all just hurdles to steady use.  
  
I never pushed my kids into climbing, it was mostly a thing they knew I did once upon a time, and or related to the various wall prototypes.  Eventually one of them got the bug though, joined the Phoenix Rock Gym and got me to start coming out every couple of months. This led to me wanting them to experience climbing outdoors, which we did, every couple of months. And all of this put me in direct contact with how out of shape I was.  Having a climbing wall at home had not helped with this. And eventually I had this epiphany - for moderate climbers, steep system walls and hangboards are just too hard to use effectively if your less-than-serious and don't have an adequate base fitness. This combined with a couple other kids being serious about cycling and various approaches to endurance, led me to realize I just needed a less-steep wall, with lots of big holds, and to do easy zone 2/3ish training. Eventually I built a bunch of simple mini-jug/side-pull/under-cling holds and have been using it for almost 2 years, about 3 times a week for sessions that have grown from just a couple minutes to now ten or more, simulating several hundred feet of climbing every week.  The result? Regardless of how long it's been since I was last at the gym or crag, I'm confident I can go climb 5.10+ V2-4 and try harder stuff with good recovery.  
  
I am at the point where I'm going to start seeing how to adapt this for a next-level step up. My daughter-in-law sets at a local gym, a couple of my grandkids climb and compete, another son is at the gym 2-3 times a week, so there's a bit of peer pressure to get out more. But between getting out, this simple <$150 DIY wall has provided me an endurance base I'm fairly certain I never had - even as a scrawny, post-gymnast, 40-50 lbs. lighter wannabe in the 80-90s.  
  
So - endurance - it gets talked a lot about in various training posts. It's seems harder to actually train for specifically for a variety of reasons that are oft discussed. And it often gets downplayed as not really important (just get better technique and get stronger and presto, you'll also have more endurance on easier stuff...). I'd love to network with anyone that wants to do some true affordable endurance testing. It might be that I'm the only one that could benefit from this, or that moderate climbers don't want to train (but do buy hangboards and get injured), or there are other reasons there shouldn't be something between a hangboard and full system wall.  I look forward to hearing what people think and answering any questions.
looking for feedback on app for injury rehab hello hello,

long-time lurker; first time poster

i built an [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rehabbit/id6474063519) for climbing injury rehab and looking for some feedback. [demo vid here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ9qVQA_IQg)

i’ve been climbing for roughly 3 and a half years now, around V7-V8 outside/boards. i’m the sorta guy who got way into grade chasing and overtraining early on, and as you might expect, got super injured: TFCC tears, PIP synovitis, pulley sprains, shoulder impingement, elbow tendonosis, p much every overuse related thing (and a few unlucky acute things too)

i got pretty obsessive learning about PT (spent a lot of time reading comments here) - and learned how valuable it can be, but also had a few pretty frustrating run-ins with traditional healthcare (e.g, went to a certified hand therapist for PIP synovitis, she told me to stop climbing and offered a corticosteroid shot) so the app’s very much inspired by my own experience rehabbing all my injuries

there’s three parts to the app:

1. **triage** - a series of questions/answers that try and evaluate what an injury might be (e.g, if you have pain with pockets but none with crimping, probably a lumbrical injury). note: we’re not trying to give a diagnosis here (and we caveat that we’re not medical advice many times), but we are trying to help people self-triage and treat minor / nagging injuries
2. **treat** - the result of triage is a rehab plan - which is a list of “phases” that we break each plan down to. so that might be something like - rest a bit, unload if it just happened, work on gaining mobility, and then slowly restrengthen and reload. the plans in the app right now are mostly stuff i sourced off prior knowledge and some consulting with PTs, but its really just a guideline - you can edit your exercises and plan as you’d like (e.g, if you wanna experiment with finger rolls vs open-handed no hangs for synovitis)
3. **talk** - finally, the app also lets you talk to a licensed PT through a 30-minute video call. working with an experienced PT (especially those who are familiar with sports science / climbing) can be invaluable - so we’re trying to make that as easy as possible. admittedly we don’t have many PTs available right now, but if anyone here is interested just shoot me a DM. it’s free to onboard and we’re not charging any fees now either (meaning if you set your price at $50 for a call, you get that in full)

and the app's free - we don't have any paywalled features (and don't really want to introduce any). [link to install](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rehabbit/id6474063519)

for transparency, we’re trying to figure out whether what we built is actually useful and something people would use. so i’d really appreciate honest feedback - what works well, what doesn’t, what you’d like to see.

that's about it. thanks y’all and lmk if you have any questions

TLDR: V3-V5 gym climber, 3-4 yrs experience, could barely hang on 25mm ledge, couldn’t send any problems that had crimps on any degree of overhang.  Felt like crimp strength was holding me back significantly.


Now I realize I am not a good climber.  I am not a climbing coach. This is not expert advice. What worked for me might not work for you.   But since a bunch of you posted that you had the same problems that I had in the original post, I wanted to share my progress / success story with yall.

My friend introduced me to board climbing.  My first session on the grasshopper board, I was *struggling* to send V0s at 15-20 degrees.  Like, maybe sent 2 or 3 out of the 10 I tried.  Mostly because I simply couldn’t hold onto any of the crimps.

I started climbing 2x a week on the grasshopper board, while only doing 1x a week of regular gym climbing.  7 weeks later…. now I’m regularly sending V3s at 30 degrees on the grasshopper board and very close to my first V4.  I can use *all* of the holds on the board, even with a 30degree incline.  I can cut feet with both hands on small crimps (both when switching a foot to a high foot or on a big move to another crimp), something I’ve *never* been able to do.  

On the gym climbs, I’m now projecting/sending crimpy V5s on slight overhangs (15-25 degrees).  Flashing crimpy V4s at the same angle. Literally breaking beta on some climbs by crimping footholds.  Seven weeks ago I was struggling to project V3s of the same type of setting.  Very close to my first gym V6 today.  

Board climbing turned my ultimate weakness to one of my strengths in only 7 weeks. It’s almost unbelievable.  I’m excited to see what happens with long term consistent board climbing.  For such quick significant gains, I imagine a large part of this is neural adaptation and me actually “learning” to pull hard with my fingers.  For those of you with similar stories to me, try out board climbing - even if you struggle at the beginning just keep at it. 

FYI for full transparency : I also lost 10 lbs during these 7 weeks, right now around 185lbs. Last year I was climbing at a BW of 183 lbs and had the same exact issues/climbing level.  Losing weight definitely helps and I’m sure is playing a role but I truly believe most of my gains are from neural adaptation / strength.
Has increasing your protein intake made a difference for you? I’m 26F, ~55kg, and have always struggled with power, general pulling strength, and putting on muscle. I boulder about 3-4 times a week (for the past 2 years) and for the 3 years before that I went occasionally (maybe once a week-ish).

About 6 months ago I decided to focus more on my diet and eating more protein and have probably upped my intake from around 40g a day, to ~60-70g a day, at least on climbing days (I have basically just added in a collagen drink and a whey protein shake). That combined with starting to take creatine 2 months ago, and going to a physio for a shoulder injury I had (and am almost fully recovered from), has massively helped with my work capacity and developing pulling strength. I’ve been able to pull more and work harder at the gym, which seems to be equalling more strength. Eg. I went from 1 pull up to 3, and flashed my first outdoor V6 the other week! 

BUT yesterday I read an article that suggested athletic women should aim for 1.8-2.2g of protein per kg. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10210857/

That would put me at 99g per day, which seems insannneee to me. But based on my recent experience I’m kinda tempted to start shooting for it, but as it would probably require a bit of a diet/lifestyle overhaul, I’m interested in others experiences before comitting.

So question: has anyone, particularly women gone from eating adequate protein (ie.min 1.2 kg/bw/day to high protein levels - ie. 1.8g*bw per day. Do you think 1.8 is needed or did you not notice any difference?

How did you fit it into your lifestyle? And do you think it helped with muscle strength and gains?

Thanks!
'CARCing': where are at with this? Experience/advice? Hey all! 
Context: (M,32) At the end of this year I'll have now spent two years of almost solely bouldering. I've found it really beneficial to narrow the focus for a while and have gone from max 7B to 8A (out) in that time. However next year I'm thinking to focus on sports climbing for a while and- having become much better at understanding training- am trying to think of ways I can begin to develop base endurance while focused on one more season of bouldering. Previously I never really understood the endurance side of climbing or how to properly train for it.

Question: I feel like the CARCing concept of frequent, extremely low intensity, forearm (?) training, outside of the gym would be something I could happily integrate into my life for a while in preparation for training endurance in the winter. Literally doing it while driving would be best. 

-Are we somewhat agreed that there's validity to the concept?

-does the exercise need to resemble crimping? (I feel sceptical about squeezing a ball for example)
- What has been people's set-up for this? (Ideally in the car) 

-Anything else I should know?

Appreciate it!
TB2 Without Kickboard? Hey all - My wife and I just closed on a new house that also happens to have a 2 car garage (woohoo!) I'm wanting to buy and build an adjustable TB2 in the space but there is a pesky beam that limits the height of the garage to 10'-1" (Most of the space is 10'-8")

I am hoping that there is a way to get the 12Hx8W board to work within our constraints, and also not make it super fussy to use. 

I have a couple of options. 

35 degree minimum angle with a very tight 3" kick board. This setup would allow my wife to enjoy the board more at the friendlier angle, but would limit the amount of room at the bottom of the board. 

40 degree minimum angle with a 10" kick board. This setup seems like it would be slightly less inclusive of my wife, but would give room for pads closer to the board and scrunchie starts. 

I guess my questions revolve around the usage of the kick board on the TB2. Since there are no feet on the kick, does it feel like something that needs to be included at all? Do you feel like the small kickboard would limit the overall functionality of the board? I'm most worried about not being able to flag on starts where you sort of sag into the holds, but unfortunately I don't have enough experience on this board in particular to make that judgment call. 

  
For reference, I climb comfortably in the v9-10 range, wife in the v3-4 range. I will be the primary user, but I also like to have company, and I don't want to purposefully exclude anyone. 

  
I have attached some Sketchup images to represent the two angles. Thanks in advance for the help!
I really like Nate Drolet's ideas around climbing and skills. I got bored at work and made this easy reference to chapters/subjects he approaches on his youtube channel. I'll try to update it as he releases stuff. Hope someone enjoys it! (PRs welcome)
Stuck at V3/V4 for almost a year I (32F) have been climbing for 21 months now. I have always been fairly active, doing some form of strength training every week for the past 10 years. I boulder indoors 3-4 times a week, occasionally swapping a boulder session for sport climbing.

My max grades are:

Indoor bouldering: V5
Outdoor bouldering: V3
Outdoor lead: 6a+
Outdoor TR: 6b+

I perform better on slab climbs, the one V5 I have sent was slab. I can consistently send most V4s in the slab section of my gym, however when it comes to overhang, I max out at V3. I really want to get out of this platue; I did feel like strength was my limiting factor but after browsing this subreddit, the general consensus seems to be technique at this level. I can do 2-3 bw pull-ups and last time I tried I could not deadhang at all on a 20mm edge which is why I believe lack of strength could be holding me back. When I first started climbing, I was weight training 2-3 times a week. I stopped this completely about 6 months into climbing as I felt the lack of rest was impacting my ability.

My sessions generally involve 20 minutes of warming up on easy climbs, focusing on moving slowly, efficiently and with intention. Then I'll do 15 minutes or so of repeating previously sent V3's, again focusing on moving efficiently. The rest of my session (30-45min) is spent on projecting. Lately this has been a stressful experience as I feel like I'm not making any progress. I actually feel like I'm getting worse.

I have videos on my profile of me climbing, feel free to critique. I know I need to do something differently in my approach to climbing, I just have no idea what. I'd like to be consistently sending V4 overhang routes by the end of the year but that might be ambitious for where I'm currently at.
Follow up: treadwall A couple months ago I posted this [https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/1d4vxdj/for\_folks\_who\_treadwall\_whats\_your\_endurance\_like/](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/1d4vxdj/for_folks_who_treadwall_whats_your_endurance_like/)

about my mediocre treadwalling. TLDR is that I'm a low 13s trad climber but was struggling to do continuous endurance on the treadwall, and I was curious how much of an outlier I was. Based on the comments, sounds like a fair bit.

The post got a decent number of upvotes and comments, so seemed like folks were interested in the topic, and I figured I'd follow up: In short, by adding a bit of focus on improving this low end endurance I was able to improve it significantly.

Over the last couple months I incorporated 20 minute continuous treadwall into my sessions. I typically do 3 gym days/week (and climb outdoors on the weekend).

For the first four week block of training I did treadwalling each gym day. On hard bouldering days I did my treadwalling at the end of the workout so as not to interfere with bouldering, and on my capacity days (on-the-minute bouldering) I did my treadwalling at the beginning of the workout figuring an aerobic warmup might not be a bad thing. Then a deload week.

For my second four week block I was doing higher intensity training (I'm getting ready for a trip) so backed treadwalling off to two days/week, as a warmup to my power endurance days.

Over the whole time I added 1 degree of overhang every \~2 sessions, so over the last two months I went from being able to climb for 20 minutes with light pump at 3 degrees to today doing 20 minutes with light pump at 15 degrees — a pretty huge change.

Since all of that wasn't really adding a ton of stress to my training I was able to maintain top-end bouldering performance throughout, doing a few new v7 moonboard benchmarks and v8 kilterboard boulders, which is top end for me for short term projects.

It's not surprising to me that I was able to get so much improvement in a short time by focusing on a major weakness, but it's still nice to see and a reminder of the value of focusing on weaknesses. Given how fast it happened, I think most of the adaptation was technical, just getting better at truly using as little effort as possible in the hands to stay on holds.

The one thing that still isn't clear if what the carryover is to actual climbing — weather has been terrible here in the NE so I haven't gotten a chance to really push myself — but I have to believe that it'll help with ability to recover on route and, assuming I maintain this through to my November RRG trip, with long/overhung climbs.
Creating an open source Tindeq alternative Hey all,

I have seen the Tindeq Progressor which looks great but it’s very expensive. As an alternative, I have found the [WeiHeng WH-C06](https://weihengmanufacturer.com/products/wh-c06-bluetooth-300kg-hanging-scale/), a Bluetooth crane scale that can be found for roughly $20 USD. I have created an open source iOS app to communicate with the scale, see the video in the repo.

[https://github.com/sebws/Crane](https://github.com/sebws/Crane)

The app is not yet published to the app store, as it is in a very rough state. However at the moment it can be used to measure max load. In the pipeline is repeaters/workouts with target pull force and hold duration.

Unfortunately due to some technical reasons it isn’t as smoothly updating as the Tindeq, however it is still very much so usable and for so much cheaper, not bad!

I’m not an iOS dev so please don’t judge code too much unless it comes with a PR.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Side note: I’m also looking at an easy way to do an open source hardware thing too for cheaper than the Tindeq and better than the WH-C06, ideally reusing the app.
How hard should I climb to improve my technique? For reference I’ve been climbing for around a year. My max is v7 and my usual projects around v6. I’ve been feeling like I’ve gotten stronger recently and my technique and footwork is now holding me back. I know volume is king when training but not sure how hard I should climb in volume. Should I be climbing lots of v2-4( something I can do with not a lot of effort) and really focus on body position, footwork, etc. or climb more 4s and 5s with the same goal. One offers more climbing and the other offers harder climbing I can still do in good volume. May I put would be great. I’ll probably try both but just wanted to see what’s worked for others.

I want to note I’ve tried traversing my gyms beginner wall with the same goal in mind but I end up feeling like I’m just training endurance not technique 

Also I’ve climbed a bit on tension and kilter board but don’t feel like they were great for focusing my technique. Am I doing something wrong or just climbing to hard on them

I’ve also heard moon board is a great trainer but I’m worried I’m not strong enough to climb it(I’ve tried a few benchmarks)
Hypertrophy in Climbing Hello!

Over the last two years I've had a lot of success with hypertrophy training, something I haven't seen/heard especially much about in the training for climbing scene.

I made a podcast summarizing my conclusions:  
[https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/nilsasken/episodes/40-Hypertrophy--solo-episode-e2m7em3](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/nilsasken/episodes/40-Hypertrophy--solo-episode-e2m7em3)

So, perhaps it could be something interesting or useful.. Would be interested in hearing if anyone else has tried some approach like this?
Does comp style technique help traditional outdoor style? So I’m 37 and been climbing for a while, 15-20 years. Which means that I’ve really seen the sport change. When I started it was all about hard outdoor climbing, and indoor climbing sought to mimic it. 

As someone coming from that era and really interested in climbing outside, I largely see all of my climbing centered towards sending outside. Even if I only get one trip a year, all my training inside is with that in mind. 

Entering into my late 30’s I’ve been more focused on technique more than ever before. I’ve really realized I’m plenty strong to climb well into the double digit V grades, but the technique on how to move really really well on rock is huge. 

So despite having absolutely zero interest in new school climbing I’m still curious, is there something technique wise to learn there that is applicable to sending hard outside? And I’m not talking about the rare outdoor boulders that are more comp style, I’m talking about sending a classic v12 in hueco. 

I can see it both ways, both relevant and irrelevant. But thought it was an interesting question nonetheless.
A Year Post Sepsis, Still Weak - who to consult? physio/personal trainer/coach? Last year I suffered from meningitis and sepsis. I have been climbing for the past 12 years and I am a late 20s male, 6'0"

For context: before I got sick, I was climbing 8aish/v11, doing 2x body weight finger boarding, one-arm pull ups, and so on.

Now I get winded from v4s and struggle to do more than 6 or so pull-ups. Climbing sessions went from being 3-5x weekly, to once every 2 weeks - as they just utterly exhaust me. Worse - seeing friends at climbing gyms who expect me to climb at the level I had, it always feels incredibly shameful to say that even 1 year I still am nowhere near the level I was prior. Its gotten to the point where I avoid the climbers I used to hang out with.

 I've tried to work my way back to where I was last year on my own - but it hasn't yielded any positive results. I've had significant injuries in the past that left me unable to climb before, such as a herniated disc in my back, dislocated shoulder, partially torn pulleys, and so on. Each time I was able to get back to my prior base level, and get stronger past it.

But it just hasn't seemed to work this time. So I'm trying to seek help, but I don't know what type of professional help I need. Afterall, its been a year since my sepsis event. My GP can't really help - I'm a physically fit person as far as they are concerned. And I'm unsure if a physical therapist would be helpful as well, since again - compared to 80 year olds recovering from a hip replacement, I am physically fit.

But at the same time, I don't know if a personal trainer has the education to deal with someone in my predicament - recovering from a life threatening illness trying to get back to their base line.

  
Anyone here have any advice or gone through a similar event?

 I'd have asked in the physicaltherapy subreddit but their subreddit rules clearly detail against personal questions, and askdoctors doesn't seem like a place to ask since its 1 year post sepsis.
Motor Learning in Rock Climbing: A Framework for Improving Technique I’ve been thinking quite a lot about learning climbing technique and I’d like to share some insights and start a discussion. 

The framework I’ll use to discuss technique revolves around some motor learning theory. This is by no means a complete essay on motor learning for climbing and I am nowhere close to an expert on the topic. I do think it covers the basics. Hopefully this framework can serve as a tool for finding your own way for improving your technical ability.

# Three stages of motor learning

To start, motor learning describes three stages of learning and mastering new movements. On a brief reflection, this is the same as learning technique for climbing. There is not a clear line between these stages and you can move back and forth between them in your process of learning.

**Cognitive stage**: In the cognitive stage of motor learning, climbers are focused on understanding and practicing the basics of movement. In this stage you learn new things, you aren’t refining them. For example, you might learn that you can hook your heel behind a hold.

**Associative stage:** The associative stage of motor learning is where climbers start to refine their movements. The main goal of this stage is that you’ll begin to 'associate' correct techniques with successful outcomes. I.e. pointing your toe down when doing a heel hook is usually more successful. This stage should be perpetual, there is always something to refine.

**Autonomous stage**: In the autonomous stage you no longer need to consciously think about every action. You can just execute. You’ll just read the beta and put your heel down, not needing to think about pointing your toe down.

The example I gave with all these stages was about one small piece of climbing technique, a heel hook. An intermediate climber might be in the associative stage for heel hooking but still be in the cognitive stage for a paddle dyno. This highlights that there cannot be a “one size fits all” solution for improving technique. 

# Feedback in motor learning

When climbing we are constantly given small pieces of information in our attempts. There are two important terms that relate to this. **Knowledge of result, and knowledge of performance**. In climbing, knowledge of result refers to whether you completed the move or fell, while knowledge of performance is about how well you executed the move. 

In addition to these different types of “knowledge”, there are different types of feedback we get. I’ll list a couple together with a (poor) definition.

* Intrinsic feedback
   * All sensory information you get when you are performing a move. E.g. a foot that is slipping, I was already falling away from the wall when I was going for the next hold, etc.
* Augmented feedback
   * Any type of feedback from an external source, i.e. video review, coach, fellow climber. This is an umbrella term. 

The following two are examples of augmented feedback.

* Descriptive feedback
   * Describing what you did. E.g. someone says you are overgripping during the entire crux section.
* Prescriptive feedback
   * Prescribing what to do next. E.g. try squeezing your but and lower back at the right time in order to keep your feet.

Every single climber has gone through some process where they looked at the knowledge about a move and together with the feedback prescribed themselves what to do in their next attempt. 

# In practice

Armed with our newly found framework, our task is now to apply it to our own climbing. Since we are dealing with learning climbing technique, I can disregard the autonomous stage from this section.

**Applied to the cognitive stage**

I often describe this stage either as “adding tools to your toolkit” or “learning new climbing vocabulary”. Consider a novice climber who has to smear on a volume instead of standing on a pink foothold. They don’t know that smearing is even a thing. How on earth are they going to figure that out?

**Applied to the associative stage**

Suppose that instead we are looking at an intermediate climber. They recognise that they have to smear on the volume but it keeps slipping. They can only sometimes get their shoe to stick. How the hell are they going to figure out that a foot slipping from a smear means that there is not enough surface area from the shoe on the volume or they are simply not putting enough pressure though it? When you are in this stage, patience and perseverance is very important. At times it can be very uncomfortable because progress has seemingly come to a halt.

*(This section is personal to me but I’ll keep it to serve as an example.)*

There is not one process for figuring any of that out but I’ll describe two effective ones. 

**One of the easiest things you can do to improve your technique is to find either a coach or some strong local climber that can you can ask for prescriptive feedback**. You can lean on their experience and process for figuring out “the beta”. You will learn all the basic techniques much quicker and it will also speed up the process to refine your movement patters. This is a form of **augmented feedback**.

Unfortunately for the self-coached climber, we don't always have some expert on hand to provide us with feedback about how we move and what to improve. **It is left to ourselves to give prescriptive feedback**. Since we are by ourselves, we have only the knowledge about the result and the intrinsic feedback. The process I use is to put into words what I think happened in my unsuccessful attempt (**descriptive feedback)**, then filter from the **intrinsic feedback** everything that I think is unrelated, and combine those two to **prescribe** **feedback** to myself in my next attempt. No doubt I just used the framework we laid out before to describe the process many of you go through yourselves. 

There are definitely challenges with this approach. For a start, you might not even know what intrinsic feedback you should filter out and what is actually important. It is also difficult to prescribe an action to yourself even if you correctly filtered out the bullshit. If nobody has told you that your non heel-hooking foot is almost as important as the heel-hooking one, it will take some time to figure that out. **The process I described above is an iterative process. You need to go through this many times.**

PS. In my opinion, trying really hard is also a technique and definitely a valid outcome of this process. More often than not, it is the first outcome I come to.

# More practical tips

I’ll end with a list of common pieces of climbing technique advice and place them in this framework by giving a very brief, non-complete description. Note that some of these are contradictory and some have a lot of overlap, that doesn’t mean they aren’t helpful. Also, you don’t have to do all of them (I don’t).

* Just climb.
   * By climbing a lot you will improve your climbing vocabulary (**cognitive stage)** and you’ll learn to **associate** the correct techniques at the right time. 
* If you suck at a style, seek out that style.
   * You are most likely strong enough to do the climb. So there are probably loads of movement patterns that you haven’t learned yet or haven’t refined. 
* Climb things that are hard for you // You only learn new things projecting.
   * No doubt hard climbs make you stronger. But hard climbs also force you to refine the movements that are in the **associative** stage for you. 
* Don’t climb things just once.
   * I haven’t touched upon the **autonomous stage** a lot. But this is how you get there. Also, there is more to learn and refine in a climb by doing it multiple times.
* Improve technique on sub-maximal climbs.
   * When you are trying at your limit, you can’t think of everything during climbing. If you can’t think, it is hard to be in any other stage than the autonomous one. That is sub-optimal for  learning technique.

Keep in mind that climbing progress is non-linear and iterative. You are never done improving. It requires significant effort to stay critical, consistent and patient.  I’ll also reiterate that this is only meant to serve as a framework to guide your own training. There are entire books written about the topic that I do not mean to undermine. Now lets discuss :)
Wide positions and how to train them Hello everybody, 

I have recently learned that I am somewhat weak in very wide positions, and am trying to fix that. 

For context, I can do a one-arm pullup on both sides most days, and feel pretty strong in my normal pullups (~ +40kg for 2 reps at 65kg bw) and wide grip pullups (+30kg for 3-4 reps). I climb 8A as my project grade, and have done several 7C/+ in a session or two. 

On some boulders I realised that even though my pullups are fairly strong, I really struggle at controlling wide positions. For example, I recently did a project in rocklands called Pendragon. In the middle section, there is a foot transition where you lock off between two good holds and move the feet over. Most people can throw for the left hand hold and catch it, while I can barely do it with my foot on, catch the hold and then move the feet over. You can see the position in the first picture. 

Initially I would assume wide pullups to be helpful here, but since they feel okay at +30kg in the widest position I can reach, it doesn't seem like it translates super well. 

I have then realised I feel super weak at 120° lockoffs. Especially so if they are in a frontal position (pic 2), where I can barely hold it 2s, instead of rotated in (pic 3). In the frontal position even 90° lockoffs feel super hard, even though I can do them with +10kg when I rotate inwards. 

I can feel those positions usually in the front of my shoulder, which seems like it might be the weak point? 

I figured I will try and train the frontal lockoff position, but since I can't currently hold it for very long I'm not sure if that's the best way to go about it 

Has anyone had a similar problem? How did you go about fixing it? Any advice appreciated!
How to stop tweaking (Rules for Training) Like many, I too, was addicted to psyche. I still am, but I have a better hold on it. It took 3-4 years of combatting 7 years of psyche abuse to develop a conservative approach to managing my addiction. 

Here's some notes I've taken over the years when I felt I learned a lesson that I did not want to forget. Some sparked from learning the hard way, some were from this sub, but all are from being sick of getting tweaks or derailed from climbing/training.


Rules for Training 
(in no particular order)

1. If you are contemplating whether or not you are recovered enough for your next climbing/training session, just rest. Completion does not equal adaptation.

If anything, you can always warm up and decide after, but this takes restraint and experience in knowing your body well.


2. When adjusting training, only add one new variable at a time. i.e. exercise, intensity, or volume.

Different people can tolerate different things, but if you are encountering tweaks regularly, reflect on how progressive your overloading actually is.


3. Complete a whole cycle (4-8 weeks or 8-12 sessions) of something before changing it. Constantly swapping interventions will never allow you to truly know what produces results.

Allow time for adaptations and then reflect on pros and cons.


4. Tendons can get sore just like muscles. It just probably shouldn't happen all of the time.

When it does, remember that they take twice as long to recover.


5. If you're feeling really good, great. Treat it the same as having a really terrible feeling session. This is not your new normal.

Maintain your training volume and intensity. Don't dig yourself into a hole by pushing harder and/or longer.


6. If you're recovering from a tweak/injury, don't return to 100% intensity once it feels better.

Return to previous intensity using a dial, not a switch.
Is finger strength my limiting factor? Should I be training with a hangboard now? I'm 27F, 5'3 135lb, been climbing for 3 years, 3 times per week, and I project V4. Can flash most V3, and get the occasional V5 if it suits my style (slab or juggy movements that aren't too tall). 

I've been in the V3-4 range for what feels like nearly 2 years now. I've always been technique focused, but lately I've started to feel like my limiting factor is grip and finger strength. Sometimes I get frustrated that my climbing friends are all taller men who climb a few grades higher than me and their beta advice simply doesn't work for me, but then I see a very strong short female climber get up the climb and sit there wondering why I can't seem to stay on the wall the same way they do. 

  
In short, I feel like I've finally hit the plateau where the advice at my grade of "just climb more" isn't giving me much progress. I do occasional strength training to keep up with muscle groups that don't get worked as much from climbing alone (leg/push, usually) but don't do any dedicated climbing training. Pinches and crimps are my enemy. 

Should I start hangboarding or do any other climbing specific training? What kind of routine is appropriate for my level? I'm slowly working on weight loss too, down from 140lb and want to get down to 130.
Affordable Tindeq Alternative Under $30: New Smart Finger Strength Trainer! TL;DR: I’ve developed an affordable alternative to the Tindeq Progressor to measure and improve finger strength in climbing, costing less than $30 USD. Check out the demo video and give me your feedback to make it better! 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtOQ4JzbI8Q


As a passionate climber and a fan of the Tindeq Progressor, I know how crucial it is to measure and improve finger strength to progress in climbing. Inspired by that idea, I’ve been developing an affordable alternative that maintains essential functionalities while offering a simple and accessible approach for everyone.

What does this device do?

- Automatic Cloud Logging: Every training session is automatically saved in the cloud, allowing you to track your progress over time.
- Comparative Analysis: You can compare your results with previous sessions or even with other climbers to see how you’re progressing.
- Intuitive Interface: Synchronizing and accessing your data is super easy, letting you focus on what matters most: climbing!

Why is it important?

Finger strength is key in many aspects of climbing, but measuring and improving this strength has been a challenge for many. This device, similar to the Tindeq Progressor but with a more economical approach, not only helps you train but also provides valuable insights into your progress, helping you train smarter.

The best part!

I’ve managed to keep the cost of this device under $30 USD, making it an accessible alternative for any climber who wants to improve their performance without breaking the bank.

Check out the video and give me your opinion

I’ve created a short demo video (just 1 minute) to show how this device works in action. Your feedback is essential to take this project to the next level, and I truly appreciate any suggestions you can offer. I’m interested in hearing:

- What do you think of the idea?
- Is there any aspect you would change or improve?
- What additional features do you think would be useful?
- Would you like to use a device like this in your training?

Here’s the link to the video – I hope you like what you see!

Your opinion matters!

I’m at a crucial development stage, and your ideas could greatly impact how this project evolves. Thank you in advance for taking the time to watch and share your thoughts!
[Meta] Has this community ever tried a climbing movement/training post series or any patchwork crowd sourced training series? Hi all,

  
This is an idea that's been in my head for a few years now, and I just felt like posting it. Feel free to tell me it's a terrible idea, I'm full of them. :)

Considering the common advice of climbing as great training for climbing, I wonder why there's never been an attempt to make a series going over general concepts in climbing movement. I know that climbing is often touted as too varied and contextual to paint in broad strokes, but I personally disagree with this notion; I've found the grand majority of moves I do on climbs, even limit climbs, to be pretty possible to categorize into different themes.

  
I've always thought it would be a cool idea to have a series of threads, each based on a certain movement type or theme. 

Something like "heel hooks" which can be further broken down into what is sometimes referred to as a "heel plant" (like, sitting on your heel) versus a heel hook for mantling versus a more garden variety heel hook. Users can post things like: outdoor climbs or MB/TB/KB benchmarks that had heel hooks which really popped light bulbs in their heads, the muscle groups that are primarily activated during heel hooks, exercises which help for heel hooks if that's a genuine physical weakness.

  
This idea can be extended to rockovers, pogos, toe hooks, barndoor movements (think like throwing for a left hand with a right foot on or vice versa), pulling through, applying/focusing tension to various body parts, climbing "boxes." Climbs that require them, muscles they activate, exercises for them, when they're efficient/inefficient.

  
It can also be extended to more general training concepts like identifying physical vs technical weaknesses, comparing/contrasting climbing on different rock types, goal setting, consistency when schedules make it difficult, etc.

  
I also never understood why this sub is so reluctant to come up with a template patchwork climbing training plan. I've always been of the opinion that, barring majorly overdoing workload/intensity, most of the time, doing any physical training will give you noob gains. So who cares if it's not perfectly efficient? Even coming up with a generic plan for pull strength, shoulder stability, contact strength, 

  
I'm aware that a lot of this knowledge can be gathered through reading books, sifting through the internet, watching videos (Neil Gresham was my personal hero when I started), personal experience, etc. But with how many really knowledgeable users there are on here, I don't know why no one has thought to crowd source some of this info.

  
Re: reading the wiki and sidebar if it comes up - I might be of the 5% of this sub that actually has read it, and maybe the 1% that has read it multiple times over the years. Maybe I've been living under a rock, but not one time have I seen any single person make reference to anything in there in discussions on the sub. There are plans and some general concepts, but they are never referenced afaik. Esp with sub growth, maybe it could even be time to revisit the wiki.

  
Overall, rather than so many users coming in to address questions/posts (some more generic than others), I think it would be cool to have some sort of regular thread where discussion can be had in a structured/arranged way.
AMA - neuroscientist, M.D., movement & pain specialist Hello everyone,

My name is Hady, I am a Medical Doctor with a background in neuroscience. My expertise is in neuronal movement control - what does my brain need to do so I can create an efficient movement. I use this approach in a 1on1 setting on a daily basis for the last 10+ years. I work with climbers, track and field athletes, swimmers, everyday people. All the way from a novice level to an elite level. Usually people come with pain problems and stay for further performance improvement.

My approach is supplementary to traditional approaches. For performance improvement my approach is also supplementary. I do not write training plans rather give out exercises that help people with the movement problems they have through adressing the "brain systems" behind it.

I thought maybe you guys have some questions about the brain, movement, or whatever comes to your mind. It is an open invitation to discuss various things. Maybe it is interesting to some of you guys.

Disclaimer: I will not diagnose anything. I will not answer questions as a "Medical Doctor" but rather as a movement specialist coach with background in neuroscience.
V12+ climbers please help. Lots of info in body explaining my specific situation and I’m in need of advice. Thanks! Struggling to improve (v11+)

Here’s where I’m at.

I’ve been climbing for pretty much exactly 5 years. I can do one arm pull-ups and all that random stuff. I’ve never hangboarded or anything really. Haven’t trained pulling in years cause it’s just not an issue for me right now.

I can run laps on the hardest climbs in the gym. Like my gym sets max v9 and I can do every one in a session with like 1 minute rest. 

We have a 2016 moonboard. I’ve done every v9 and below, 22/28 v10 benchmarks and 1/4 of the v11 benchmarks (532/561 total). 

I can’t keep moonboarding 5 times a week because my fingers just don’t feel that healthy, but I can’t improve on the gym climbs. I really feel hardstuck. Sometimes I drive 2 hours just to climb in big city gyms with lots of hard stuff, but that’s ~70USD just for a climbing session. 

My local crag is 1.5 hours away and really isn’t safe to go alone. It’s from a rock slide so obviously the landings are not good. 

I’ve tried hangboarding but it just doesn’t feel useful right now. Moonboarding is making my finger strength continue to improve quite rapidly. I don’t know what I’m lacking when I don’t have anything to push myself on. It’s weird to have something like this to complain about so I’m hoping some really strong guys on here can help.

Thanks for any advice! I’ve tried posting this multiple times but it keeps getting taken down so now I’m writing this random stuff.

I won a comp at our local crag recently and got some good prizes :) sent 2 v10s, 1 v9, and 2 v7’s in 4 hours and 30C weather
From boulderer to sport climber in 3 months, summary and reflections I made this post a few months ago:
https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/s/qJhXzY5qVW

My goal was to go from 6c to doing a specific 8a route outdoors (I already boulder V10) and not come last in lead nationals that is in October (which is quite a likely outcome if you don't climb 8a or above).

So why am I writing this now and not in October?
Well. 2 weeks of sickness followed by injury less than a month before nationals forces me to skip nationals unless I want to compete in terrible shape. I will also miss the outdoor season sadly. But, I did make a lot of progress on lead and got a bit of coaching and shared a few session with some very good climbers in the national team, which was very helpful and I thought these insights might bw worth sharing. I will also be reflecting about what I would have done differently.


Start of the journey and insights:
Firstly, right after my last post, I did the 6c+ route next session and got some advice from one of the climbers on the national team.
He said during his base phases for lead, he'd hammer the endurance and go for more than 3000 moves a week or so, averaging to 3h+ of endurance and then he'd do 2 limit boulder sessions and maintainance gym sessions during this time for like 8-10 weeks. This is obviously way too much volume for me to manage, but it inspired the final product of my training.
He looked at my climbing and said I need to be way faster, like way way faster. His last comp, he topped the finals route in 2 min and I was not halfway up a wall of the same height in 3 min. He said to stop chalking up all the time when I don't need to, move quicker and climb "arrogantly and determined". He really emphasized the importance of climbing really determined and not hesitating at all. He said I looked as if I climbed like I was just trying not to fall, not as if I was trying to top the route.

This advice really stuck with me and I focused a lot on fast execution, less hesitation and committing for those scary clips where I'm so pumped that I feel like I'm gonna fall off while clipping. I also re-read the chapter from '9/10 climbers' about fear of falling and came to the conclusion that I just have to keep racking up those falls in high numbers until they feel trivial if I want to truly be able to use my full strength while lead climbing. So I did quite a bit of fall training and I climbed with a lot of intention, challenging my comfort zone every session. It went from dreading trying hard routes on lead and being mentally drained after 1 attempt, to pumping out 5 attempts on a project in a session and taking big whips without a second thought.
Trusting the belayer and not getting short roped was a huge one for the fear of falling. I really can't expect to perform or climb close to limit unless I had that.

Training plan wise:
I changed my training plan many times since I had more time than I thought and I just learned more things. Because I was pressed on time and did hard physical work in my free time, I removed all supplementary training and only climbed. This is what I ended up doing:

Week 25-32:
I was 2-3 lead sessions per week and 1 boulder for maintaining strength.
1 volume session, at or below flash, practicing pacing, clipping, resting, climbing with a pump and so on.
1 limit session, projecting something slightly out of reach on lead.
1 limit boulder session, Moonboard or hard projecting.
At the end of sessions I would do aerobic capacity training in the form of:
- 20 min on the wall on autobelay or 4 on 1 off for several sets. Sometimes I did 20 min, rest 10, 20 min again. Or 4 on 1 off for 4 sets.
- 7:3 repeaters at 30-40% 1rm on 20mm on hangboard at home
- Easier on the minute boulders for 10 min in most warmups

I then logged how many minutes of endurance training in total I hit each week. Not gonna lie, the aerobic capacity really sucked. I did not like doing laps on autobelay, but 3 weeks in I did my first 7a on lead and I felt like my recovery had rapidly improved. I still felt that the total amount of moves I could do did not change, I still pumped out as quickly, but recovered faster.
On average I did a total of 60-70min of structured endurance training per week.
The first weeks, I did all my aerobic endurance on the wall and I kind of stopped getting the feeling of pump the same way during sessions. I powered out and fell, but I didn't get that same burning sensation and I quickly recovered, one hanging routes with 1 min rest in the rope instead of doing 3-5 min rest. So my recovery started to take off.
I did notice my max strength drastically drop and most sessions my forearms were toast strength wise, but endurance was improving. I stopped doing 40 min endurance in 1 day, because I would be destroyed my next boulder sesh even if I had a rest day in between. I had like 3-5 days in total where I felt fully fresh during these 8 weeks.

But then I had a week where I didn't lead climb and partied quite hard on the weekend. This was week 31. I did boulder 4 sessions that week, but only one 20 min 7:3 repeater session of aerobic training that week.
Coming back, the previous fitness was not as prominent after that week. I then started to do the aerobic capacity on the hangboard at home to save time, usually doing sessions in the day and hangboard in the evening. I did not feel my fitness come back doing this.

I stuck to this for 8 weeks, then I was supposed to move into "power endurance", which I changed after some advice from the guy on the team who suggested 1 min on, 1 min off in the steep 50-60° tunnel we have at the gym. So it became more aerobic power. This didn't really happen though.

Week 33-34:
I had planned to do lead projecting coupled with aerobic power for 6 weeks. 3 weeks tunnel 1 on 1 off for 10 sets, very high RPE. Then route doubles for 3 weeks. And then only onsight training last 2 weeks before the comp+getting on the outdoor project any weekend where I had the opportunity.

I shared a few projecting sessions on lead with a friend who's also a very very good climber during this time and I found a really bouldery 10m long 7c/+ route. It split into a 6A+ boulder slab into a really good rest into a sustained crimpy 7A/+ boulder with no rest to the anchor.
I got some good coaching on this and 5 sessions in after having fallen on the second to last move on 7 attempts in total, I took the advice from my friend. He said that he thinks I could get in a really quick shake on my left hand in the crux section of the route where I'm sitting deep into a drop knee and that it could give me several moves more and like 10% more energy. I was really sceptical, it sounded like he overestimated how much of a difference that little shake would make. But first time I tried it, I sent the route and when I absolutely chilled all of the final moves with margin. I had several hard moves left in the tank, all because of a 2-3 second shake in the middle of the crux. This was mindblowing to me, I never thought it would make such a difference.

How it ended:
So I went from 6c to 7c/+ in less than 3 months, mainly because I found a route that suited me and had good guidance. During the time I did the route, I tried cutting weight for some bad reason and got sick within 2 weeks and also experienced a lot more niggles. I stopped creatine, went from 75.8kg to 73.3kg in 2 weeks, then was sick for 2 weeks and dropped from 73.3 to 71.5kg. I came back and on my second session back I had a 30 min kilter sesh and strained 2 A2 pulleys in each middle finger. Now I'm basically back to square one, taking a 2 week break and switching focus to gym and building shoulder strength, then I aim to return to mainly bouldering.

Reflections:
1. Ideally I would have wanted to do even higher volume of aerobic capacity training, but most importantly ON THE WALL. The hangboard 7:3 at home did not bring the same feeling of fitness that the on the wall training did. Muscles used in climbing is more than just the forearms working in a halfcrimp on a flat edge. The on the wall is suffering, it's painful, but it works. It worked better than "just lead climb" alone for recovery and feeling fit. Maybe I also should have done shorter higher intensity intervals and allow a larger amount of pump as long as I could recover during the rest times.
2. Microshakes or just getting a short shakeout during a sustained hard section of climbing can sometimes be the difference of sending and not sending. Just that short time of blowflow can really make a difference.
3. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think route climbers probably also get pumped, and quite a lot as well. They just recover so damn well on so many different holds and positions. I don't know if their glycolytic energy system is that much more developed than a boulderer like me necessarily. With no rest, no micro shake and just sustained hard climbing, they pump out too. But if they just get to that slightly easier section, they can recover on that easier level of climbing in a way that I can't. Getting pumped is a part of the game, recovering quickly from pump
4. Fear of falling is probably the nr.1 reason you are falling on lead if you are a boulderer. If you can't relax and hold the holds with minimal effort, just enough so that you don't slip off, because of fear, then you are constantly wasting energy.
5. When analyzing lead climbing, pacing is such a huge thing that is easy to overlook as a boulderer. Don't climb a section slower than you need to and split the routes up into sections of sustained effort and rest.
6. Climb arrogantly, overconfident, full commitment. Fast and effective, minimize hesitation and climb as if you are aiming to top the route with determination, not as if you are avoiding falling for as long as you can.

Pitfalls in my anecdote:
I did not only lead climb without doing any other edurance training. I don't know how my progress would have looked like if I only lead climbed. The route I did was not very long and pumpy, because I didn't manage to develop my endurance for long sustained effort in this time. I suspect I might have done better at this pumpy climbing after my 6 weeks aerobic power training that I had planned for, but I can't tell if it would've taken longer than that.
Kilter too morpho at harder grades as a short-ish climber Hello folks, recently I've been having to rely on the system boards more and more because it is hard to find gym sets that are hard enough to project on. This isn't exactly a brag about my skill, I only climb v10 outdoors but all the gyms near me set \~v11 at the absolute hardest.

Anyways, the nearest boards to me are of course the kilter and moon boards. As I've been pushing the grades on kilter I found that the climbs past v9-10 get incredibly reachy and contrived. I am a short climber at 5'5". On most "hard" moves I am at full span and the movements just seem unrealistic for outdoor climbs as there is almost always a way to get around reachy moves on real rock. I have no issue with dynamic movements either, but on most climbs the crux for me tends to be managing the opening span to get to whatever crazy dyno was set than the dyno itself. In fact all of the v11s I have done on kilter were the ones intentionally designed to support cuts. 

I am curious to other short climber's experiences with training on the kilter board, and on system boards in general.
Stem cells I got human-derived (umbilical, placental) stem-cell injections for my A2 pulley tear in left hand ring-finger. Using this post to document my experience since I didn’t come across any first hand experience online when I was researching. 

I got three injections in my finger : one in PIP joint, one in MCP joint, and one at the base of my finger, palm side. And another injection in my wrist joint. 

The injections were relatively painless with minor discomfort following. I was able to flex my hand and finger most immediately. This was surprising since I’ve had stem cell injections done before in my shoulder, and that was much more painful. 

I’ll keep updating and answering questions if people are interested. AMA.
ARCing "lattice way", fighting the pump ! Lattice published this video lately and surprisingly it didn't pop here...
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sgzQFVFFXPA

I tried it and here is my experience :
I can boulder around 7a+/7b.
Lead climbing a 7a or 7a+ usually took me 10/15 tries.
I have tried it for over a month, increasing from 20 mins to a full hour lately (per arm), doing it at least 2 times a week up to 3 times. I have seen very good results, after that month I did a 7a+ in 3 tries, and could have done it first try !
I think it seems to work very well for me (needs more time to confirm this) because, I think I am naturally more a strong type than an endurance type profile. And also when I am lead climbing I have fear of falling and pump kicking at the same time at half the route. So taking of some pump made the fear of falling less present. Without the fear of falling I think I could climb 7b+ may be 7c
I dealt with many muscle strain/tendinosis etc. over the past years, so I know when to stop doing and how to increase to not provoque another one...

Am I the only one that tried this ?

Also thanks to lattice to create/make discover such new ways of training, which, with a full time job and 2 kids is very much appreciated !
My indoor grades are lower than my outdoor grades It seems to be consensus, that climbing V-something inside is easier than doing the same outside. For me, this never felt true. I am stuck in V6 to V7 circuits in nearly all indoor gyms I visit and outside I just managed to climb V8 in a day and did V9 in two. I did V8s in three different areas, so I am fairly sure it's not only soft grades in an area. Admittedly I think the V9 was very soft.I also climbed around 15 ish V8s on the Kilter board.

The weird thing is, my climbing time is 95% indoors so far. This leads me to my question. Are there people that were in the same situation I am, did you manage to get better at indoor climbing and did it translate to your outdoor performance? 

To give a few more stats:
Finger strength - I would call it my strength, I recently managed to hang a 22mm edge one handed and can lift over 100% body weight on the tension block 20mm edge.  

Upper body strength - I don't know, I can do two weighted pull ups at around 130% body weight and I can do lock offs at 90 degrees for 10 ish seconds.  

Flexibility - very poor shoulder flexibility poor to okay ish hip flexibility.
Seeking advice on building mental resilience after traumatic climbing accident Hey everyone. I’ve been climbing 10 years and finally experienced a bad leader fall. My partner and I were on a multipitch route when he fell and sustained a critical injury. The rescue was a surreal process and has left my eternally grateful for SAR and for the medical training I have.

It has been 6 months now and I’m climbing pretty hard in the gym. I did emdr for a few months and recognize the accident wasn’t my fault, and that I did all I could for my friend. I have no fear of falling in the gym or on sport routes and I also work in single pitch terrain as my day job of being a climbing guide. I have no problem leading easy routes for guests but I have really struggled with my headspace when leading trad. It’s pretty rough because I will start to panic, think I will take a traversing lead fall, and I remember the crunching sound of my friend’s bones. My hands sweat and I tense up really bad. Leading things harder than 5.6 spooks me to a shameful amount and I have moments of terror where I think I should give up climbing completely.

I don’t want these intrusive thoughts to win. I want to climb hard on gear again but I don’t know how to feel better about it.
My successful tindeq protocol for rehabbing my A2 injury Hey all,

Over the last couple of months I have been experiencing pain in my A2 pulley on my left hand.   
I have been experimenting with multiple methods to rehab said finger and I think I have stumbled onto a winner for myself. I'll caveat that, I am not a physiotherapist just a person with a tindeq.

I first started with a protocol involving long holds (10s+) on a mono 20mm edge, pulling just before I experienced pain in my case 6-7kg. After a couple of weeks of this I experienced zero to no progress in my finger, I still had to tape it when I went indoor and outdoor climbing. During this time I was reading and watching lots of videos on the subject and the idea of density hangs stuck. 

The secret I found to my recovery was a slow and deliberate increment to the weight %.   
To begin I used my previous MVC (Max pull) prior to my injury, in this case 60kg on each hand. I then started at 25% of my MVC and slowly increased it depending on how the set felt. I found 25% to be just before I would experience painful symptoms in my pulley.   


To progress I would slowly add percentages based on the experience of the set. For example on a day where I struggled through the set I would not increase the percentage, but when I felt strong and the set felt easy I would often wait 8 minutes and repeat the set. Then the next day increase the weight by 2%.

I have done this protocol for the last 2 months and my fingers have felt bullet proof, currently I use around 50% of my MVC for my sets without pain in my pulley, which is substantial improvement from the first sets I was completing. 

**The protocol:**

**30s on**//**10s rest**//**5 reps**

I half crimp, on the 20mm natural climbing edge.

30 seconds pulls on a 20mm edge with a tindeq, completing a repletion on each hand.  
10s rest between reps to change hands.   
5 reps in each set,  

2 sets if you feel strong, with an 8 minute rest between.

**Tindeq usage:**

As I don't have a bar or anything to attach it to in my house, I use a sling and place my foot through.   
This allows me to exert force while standing or sitting, if I am pulling with my left hand I will place the loop through my right foot and vice verse.

Why does my climbing look stiff? I’ve been climbing for \~7 years and have sent a dozen or so double digits outdoors, but I’ve been feeling like my climbing doesn’t look as graceful or flowy as I’d want it to, which seems like a symptom of a weakness that I can improve on. In my mind I thought that my climbing was more technical than powerful, but video evidence suggests otherwise… My suspicion is that I need to focus on my footwork and lower body more (and/or climbing with more momentum and rhythm), so I’d appreciate any advice on what I can do to improve my movement efficiency and flow, whether it’s specific drills, mental approaches, or anything else that could help me climb more gracefully.

For reference, my strength metrics are pretty good (180% max hang on 20mm edge, 160% 2 rep max pull up) and flexibility is slightly above average (according to lattice’s strength assessment). My preferred style is overhung/roof/3d climbing requiring nifty heel/toe hooks and good body tension. Slabs and coordination dynos are my antistyle. Also not great at moonboarding unless I train specifically on it for a while. I climb better outdoors than indoors. I realize that I most likely fall into the “strong not good” category and thus am looking for ways to improve my technique.

Here’s a video of me climbing a bunch of easy/moderate routes in a new gym, flashed all of them except for the last two. Yes, I’m already aware that my route reading also needs improvement, and that some part of the sloppiness comes from not knowing the beta :P

Thanks in advance!
Is Lattice wrong about Stretching? In basically any Lattice video / Instagram post about stretching I see them promoting active "strength" stretching for getting flexible and gaining strength. I have tried one of their protocols from a video for about 4 months. I did the 3 sets of 3 exercises twice a week for about 4 months and saw very little progress in terms of stretching. Even regarding my strength in the end ranges. It was worse in any measurable way than with what I did before, which was Squats and RDLs. I then switched to doing regular passive stretching and/or PNF stretching as a warmup to my sessions and completely stopped doing any regular lower body strength training. I chose 3 stretches and did 3 sets of 60 seconds thrice a week. It took me few weeks to see more progress than I did in the 4 months prior. After 5 months I saw incredible results in my flexibility. I still have my active and passive ranges very close to each other. 

I also came across this video:

[Why The Hottest Flexibility Trend Is Actually Terribly Ineffective (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRzXBkE2SDk&t=9s&ab_channel=YiannisChristoulas)

Where he basically talks about how this stretching method is ineffective.

On the other hand, the guys at lattice seem to be fairly flexible with good results across their clients, still promoting this stuff. Is it possible I just respond completely different to this method than their clientele? 

Is here anyone who tried their promoted method consistently for longer periods of time and saw different results? What are your thoughts?
What's your simple yet effective tip? I've come from a tennis background, where having a coach analyse your technique and provide feedback is the norm every time you practice. Sometimes, they can spot something, give you some simple feedback, and you find that if you concentrate on their advice your consistency, shot quality - everything - will improve.

As an example, my coach emphasises preparing early to hit an opponent's shot back. If you can bring your racquet back before the ball is even over the net coming towards you, it gives you time to move, prepare, and strike the ball with confidence. The result is fewer unforced errors and an overall increase in performance. Just having the coach tell you to prepare early, or reminding yourself of it during a match yields instant results.

My question is this: do you have an equivalent nugget of wisdom/advice for climbing? What's your 'remember to prepare early' that acts as a mental trigger during a send, or improves the quality of your session at the gym? We don't have 1-to-1 coaches in climbing as 'standard' often, so I feel like we could miss these simple yet effective tips.

How do olympians spend their 8hr sessions Hello! 
I’m a newish competition climber with a lot of time on my hands. 
I see many comp climbers, Erin mcniece, Toby roberts, Janja, who climb 40+ hours a week, 6/7 days a week. 

Obviously a very large factor making this possible is that their bodies are much more used to training and are better suited to recovery and push for longer. However they still must be spending a decent portion of that time doing things that aren’t terribly physically taxing, and I was wondering what those sort of things they do to train technique, coordination, balance, etc, while also not being very physically taxing. 

Also, if they’re training 6 days a week basic things about scheduling training plans, such as which days to train power vs endurance, as well as in which part of a single days workout to organize different workouts. 
These things are covered in a lot of different sources, be it climbing books, or lattice videos, whatever, but I feel all of those training plans are perhaps fundamentally, perhaps subtly, different than that of a training plan for competition, as they exist to accomplish different goals, and usually aren’t expecting absolute optimal recovery, schedule, motivation. If anyone knows of any books related specifically to high level comp climbing, I would love recommendations. 

For context about me, I’m 18, I had some climbing experience when I was younger, but have been climbing hard and training 5~ days a week for about 2 years now. I climb about v9/10 on kilter and MB, and redpoint around 5.13. I care about and enjoy lead a bit more, but the only lead gym where I live is quite short (23~ft walls) and doesn’t set hard, so most of my training is on spw, boards. or commercial boulders, but I have lead gyms a couple hours away I can get to decently often, maybe 1-2 times a week. 
I work very little and have a lot of time to dedicate to climbing, I can easily put 40+ hours into the sport a week if I know how to do so without overt taxing my body. I’m also able to often get 11/12 hours of sleep in a night, regularly eat 3500-4000 calories in a day, I have little stress in my life and feel like my recovery is very well optimized. 

Thanks for any advice, or information on sources where I can read and learn about training more specific to what I’m looking for, thanks 😊.
A basic outline of a training plan you can use for yourself. Hi! My name is Dylan, I'm a professional remote climbing coach and owner of The Stone Project. I have worked with hundreds of climbers all over the world, accruing hundreds of testimonials as proof of my work. I’ve gotten climbers to their first V3/5.10 all the way to their first V14/5.14 and everything in between (no, these are not the same climbers). I specialize in diagnosing weaknesses in strength, mental, and technical areas, cross-referencing that with their unique goals, and then setting milestones and timelines to make sure we stay on track toward those goals.

I want to preface this by saying that everything I do is highly personalized to each individual climber. Unless I know more about YOU specifically after testing, forms, and assessments, I can’t get into super-specifics. And while I am a professional coach, I’m just a guy on the internet, so take everything I say with a grain of salt—ultimately, you need to find what works best for you. That said, I’m going to give you a very basic outline for a 12-week plan to help you build your own training routine. Keep in mind a few things: consistency, learning how to say no, deloads, managing volume and intensity, and setting goals.

# Consistency

Yes, discipline and doing the things you are supposed to do are very important, but it’s also about adaptability. If you go in feeling less motivated, weak, or tired, it's okay to climb lower grades, do fewer reps, or change a day. As long as you stay with the goal and keep doing what you're doing, you will see improvement (if it’s done correctly). Remember, "People overestimate what they can do in a month and underestimate what they can do in a year."

# Learning How to Say No

If you want to improve, you need to avoid distractions when you go to the gym. If you see a new set but are supposed to work on your project, you need to be able to say no to the new stuff.

# Deloads

This is going to be your best friend when it comes to not overtraining and managing your progression. I generally schedule deloads every 4, 6, or 8 weeks; however, if you're feeling extra tired, you can always take a deload week to listen to your body, even if it isn't scheduled.

# Managing Volume and Intensity

If you’re climbing hard relative to your level and the intensity is high, then your volume needs to go down. Volume is great in many cases, but it also takes the longest to recover from, and doing too much volume could increase the chance of injury.

# Goals

This is probably going to be one of the most important things to help you improve. Training without a clear end in sight makes it very hard to stay motivated. Set your big goals, monthly goals, weekly goals, daily goals, and even goals for each individual workout. This is what I do for my athletes so they know exactly what they’re working on.

# Now On to the Plan: Setting Goals

First, we need to actually set those goals. Figure out what exactly you want to achieve with your climbing and keep it realistic, meaningful, and measurable. If you're struggling to narrow it down, start by making a list of all the random things you want to do in climbing, rank them, and then ask yourself, "What is holding me back from achieving this goal?" Start breaking it down into smaller goals. Focus on 1-3 goals at a time because a common mistake is trying to cram too many things into a short timeline.

# Testing Strength and Movement

After setting your goals, do some testing for strength and movement. I’ve built my own strength tests for my athletes, but there are plenty of free resources out there. For movement assessments, record yourself climbing. I like to use boards because part of my movement assessments involves having my athletes re-climb the same exact climbs every 8-16 weeks (with new climbs added after re-testing) to track improvement over time. The initial assessment usually takes a keen eye, so having a friend, coach, or comparing beta videos can be a huge help in identifying weaknesses.

# The 12-Week Process: Weekly Breakdown (I'm using a M, W, F schedule of a general intermediate climber as an example)

# Weeks 1-4: General Strength Training

* **Focus on** general strength training, getting used to hangboarding consistently, and building up leg and upper body strength.
* Ideally, do strength and power work before climbing (but this order can change if your goals are more technical).
* Gradually progress the weight or time every week.

**Example Session Breakdown**:

* Warm-up: 5-10% of the session
* Strength training: 15-20%
* On-the-wall work: 60-70%
* Cool-down: 5% (e.g., walking on a treadmill at a slight incline for 10-20 minutes)

**Suggested Weekly Routine**:

* **Monday**: Skill development or focusing on weaknesses.
* **Wednesday**: Intensity climbing or projecting with a purpose.
* **Friday**: A mix of skill development and projecting, or replace this with some volume climbing.

**Deload in Week 4**: While deloading, keep the intensity the same but reduce the volume of everything you do by 40-60%. Re-test numbers on the last day of the week if you’d like.

# Weeks 5-8: Climbing-Specific Strength

Now we can get into more climbing-specific strength work. Follow the same progression, but consider adding weight to hangboards, doing weighted pull-ups, or building lock-off strength.

**Suggested Weekly Routine**:

* **Monday**: Skill development.
* **Wednesday**: Skill development or project-focused climbing.
* **Friday**: Project climbing or volume.

**Deload in Week 8**: Re-test at the end of the week if you want.

# Weeks 9-12: Power Training

Now we move on to power work (e.g., power pull-ups, box jumps, contact strength). Make sure you’re using a weight that allows you to move quickly and explosively.

**Suggested Weekly Routine**:

* **Monday**: Projecting above your limit.
* **Wednesday**: Skill development or limit climbing.
* **Friday**: Alternate between an easy day and a skill development day.

**Deload in Week 12**: Re-test any numbers, and revisit the same climbs you did in the initial movement assessment. Compare the recordings to see the difference.

# Final Thoughts

This is an extremely general plan. I didn’t include everything because creating personalized plans is nuanced and varies for each individual, but hopefully, this helps someone start building a structured approach. Remember, consistency, learning how to say no, managing your workload, and setting the right goals are the keys to climbing progress.
Breaking a 10 year plateau Hi!

While lurking here, although there are plenty of experienced people that chime in, I see lots of posts from people with short climbing careers (less than a year, less than 5 years) so I want to give a perspective from someone who has been climbing since the late 2000s and has recently had a second wind. The last couple of years I have been climbing the hardest I ever have. 

I consider myself a ‘mid-school’ climber - pre-Instagram, post-GriGri. The Chris Sharma era. Definitely not ‘old-school’ as there are truly old-school amazing people still around. I’m in Australia which I freely admit is a climbing backwater and a decade or more behind North America and Europe.

In the last year, all outdoors, I have redpointed another sport 24 (soft 5.12, matching a previous ascent from 2014) onsighted 23 placing draws, climbed a V6 and several V5s, flashed V4, and onsighted a trad 18 (\~5.9).

I started climbing at age 18, I’m now 34. Had a major break from about 2016 to 2020, I was still occasionally climbing indoors but stopped thinking of myself as a “climber”.

I did what I thought was my first V5 outdoors in 2011. Years later, I realised I had used holds on a neighbouring V3, and never properly climbed the problem. At the time, in my region, in my gym (a backwater, as I said) I shit you not V5 and 5.12 were like elite grades. People would stop what they were doing and watch attempts of the coolest hardest climbing person in the gym. It has been a pretty big mental barrier for me to get over that and accept that ordinary people can climb way harder.

Anyway, what’s the point? Well, here is my spray.

* Ticking a personal best grade is great, but I’m telling you, years later, **you will remember the people and the places** - but you won’t really remember most of the climbs. At the end, it truly won’t matter whether you climbed a couple extra grades harder or not. Just that you climbed.
* **The people you climb with are the biggest influence on how you climb**. If you want to climb harder, you need to find the people who are climbing harder, and join them. (In real life, not on reddit, r/climbharder and ccj don’t count). I’m not the most social person myself so this is a bitter pill I still have to force myself to take.
* **Get coaching in person if you can**. GET COACHING IN PERSON. One in-person session is worth a whole online program.
* Coming back from a bad injury or accident is one of the hardest tests. **I don’t trust advice from people who have only known progress and never had a long period of decreased performance**. I have had elbow tendinopathy for a long time. Like a decade. I had come to terms with the fact that, if I wanted to climb, I was just going to have to deal with elbow pain for the rest of my life. But - even with that history - it’s improved so much these days. I am pain free when I climb now, truly. It’s possible to get back on top of a case that chronic. I still have to do a LOT of antagonist exercises (which I probably *will* be doing for the rest of my life) and get occasional twinges the day after.
* Dave McCleod’s “9 Out Of 10 Climbers Make The Same Mistakes” I found the best book on climbing harder. The reason you can’t send is because of your anxiety and because your outdoor project is 4 hours away. There’s paragraphs in that book that make my hair stand on end when I read them.
* On the other hand, I think the “The Rock Warriors Way” is a load of total wank (sorry, impeccable wank) I found it useless, in fact I’ve never been able to bring myself to finish it.
* **Community sharing of beta is a massive boost**. A few weeks ago someone posted here that beta videos were aid, and got ridiculed. They were kind of right though. In this day and age with phone cameras and a library of different beta videos on file, it’s like having the video game walkthrough. We used to just like, miss an entire hold that no-one noticed, or fail to imagine whole sequences on climbs, or literally try to climb entirely the wrong line. Yes, we were bad climbers. I remember one particular problem that my whole crew put a session into, and no-one got close. Years later I revisited it, looked up a beta video, and did it in a couple shots. We had been trying completely the wrong thing for hours. Climbing with absolutely no beta at all can be humiliating, at any level. But I don’t really mean to mythologise it - in fact the opposite, if you want to break into a harder grade, beg for every crumb of microbeta you can.
* **Technique is like the iceberg meme, it goes down for miles**. We used to think we were like, black belt secret masters for doing an inside flag or a bit of crack jamming. How little we knew. True dynamic climbing, hip trajectories, a hundred different kinds of tension from toes to teeth, “boxes”, the knowledge and coaching in climbing today is blooming and it’s fantastic. I think the best climbers in the past were doing a lot of this stuff, but just couldn’t explain it. See the point about getting coaching in-person.
* Speaking of which: **Board climbing is technical!** Where the hell do people think it’s “just” strength? There’s, again, a deep iceberg of things to think about on why you can’t send a board problem, before you just blame your arms. Also, people who think the 2016 Moonboard has “big” holds, haha fuck you.
* Having said all that. **Don’t not be strong**. The Lattice 20mm edge benchmarks were a huge wakeup call for a lot of long-time climbers who assumed their fingers were “pretty strong” - and realised that other people were working with, in some cases, almost twice as much raw finger strength (while lecturing about “technique”!) The finger training knowledge has come so far as well. Back in the day we had plastic Metolius Simulator hangboards (ugh!) and weighted hangs were unheard of. People would just do repeaters on jugs at bodyweight. I remember when the Beastmaker came out and it was revolutionary.
* I actually think comp climbing and modern style is great, technical, improves your body sense and precision. It gets you into that "spirit forward" flow of believing in yourself and surging upwards and willing yourself to stick. I make fun of my old mates that can't do a coordination move, just as much as I make fun of kids that can't hand jam or climb slabs.
* Variety is great but if you want to push yourself, you kind of have to specialise, for a while at least. I enjoy being a triple threat (boulder, sport, trad) but it has held me back in a lot of ways. Most of us just don’t have the time to have sport, boulder, trad, outdoor, indoor projects on the go, not to mention other sports and hobbies. You have to let some things go and do the thing you really want to do.
* Climbers are just people in the end, and not necessarily good people. It can be a magical community to discover, but it turns out we do have the same emotions and flaws as everyone else. Overall I think it’s still the best sporting community around.

If you read any of that - thanks. Climbing is amazing. I still find rock climbing unbelievable - why do natural holds even exist on rock, it’s so unlikely, how is climbing a cliff actually possible? Although there have been a few ups and downs, I still love it after 16 years and hope to do it for as long as I can.

Tl;dr; make friends IRL, use the moonboard, git good.
Maximizing Outdoor Potential (and how much do external factors matter?) Hi all! Years-long reddit lurker that is finally biting the bullet here, so please be gentle if I biff the etiquette.. and apologies in advance for the long-windedness and disjointed thought process.

**The Question**

My main goal with this post is to get a larger pool of anecdotal experiences re: reasonable changes to make in order to best reach my highest possible peak outdoors, given that I started at 20, and was generally active but never an athletic monster. What I want is to send V10, V11, hell V12 one day if it suits, and I want to keep improving as best I can at this insane sport until I roll into my grave (or the incinerator, whatever).  
Distilled into a few questions:

1. How much does being around a higher concentration of stronger climbers affect your own climbing in terms of technique acquisition/improvement?
2. How much of a factor is it to have boulders accessible within 30min to 1hr vs slightly over 2hrs drive?
3. Are (1) and (2) important enough that I shouldn't just continue to try and improve within my current circumstances? (i.e. is it worth it to move somewhere else, even if just for 3 month/seasonal blocks?)

**CONTEXT**  
I'm a 29 year old woman (5'4 with neutral ape, currently around 140lbs and 21%BF since last measured a month ago) based in the PNW, who got hyped on gym climbing in 2016 but never started going outside seriously at all until late 2020. Previous sports growing up included karate, basketball, sprints, and badminton (all recreationally, none anywhere near any level of note).

By my own measure, my main strength is power/compression, I prefer overhang by a substantial amount, feel very comfortable in a chisel grip and half crimp (historically \~160-170% BW hangs on 20mm, haven't tested recently) and okay with 3FD, and generally pretty good with heel and toe hook pulling (leg muscles finally coming in handy). However, I do struggle with generating on sketchy or sort-of-not-there feet, especially when the hands aren't good enough to compensate, and am pretty uncomfortable with a full crimp position.

Between 2016 and 2020, I purely climbed in the gym, could not do a single pull up, and still ended up taking a few month breaks in 2017 and 2018 due to overuse-related finger injuries and life events. 2018 => 2020 saw me casually gym climbing 2-3x/week.

From 2020 => 2024, I caught the outdoor bug thanks to a friend, and I've progressed from my first V2s/3s on granite to doing my first V8s this year (and a soft?? V9 that I'm still very proud of). A bulleted summary of those years as follows:

* 2020: Went outside with the intention of climbing for the first time (as opposed to hanging out, which is how I would distinguish the maybe two times I went outside to boulders in the 2018-2019 range), and got my first V2s and V3s, as well as the motivation to keep going outside more, because damn, I didn't know climbing was like this.
* 2021: I started doing basic supplemental strength training (bench, deadlift, pullup progressions to 10 pullups!) and some sporadic hangboarding, mostly bumming off a friend's workout outline, traveled to climb for the first time, got out to Leavenworth a few times, and got my first V4s outside.
* 2022: What I think of as my big ramp up year. Continued to weight train, added some lock-off specific work/drills. Traveled to climb more (Red Rock, Squamish), went through a sport phase that saw me getting out to the crag during the week after work 2-3x/week and then getting back to train some more at the gym, projecting and sending my first 5.12a, and doing my first V5s, 6s, and one 7 on rock. I was unfortunately (and this is still something I struggle with) majorly guilty of overtraining and not taking enough rest days, which led to me getting some medium-ish knee issues and ankle problems. Stoke still high!
* 2023: More of the same from 2022 (subtracting the sport climbing, adding a dedicated lifting day or two), more trips outside to more places (Joe's, Bishop, more RR, Squamish), more weekend trips to the Leavenworth, a random 3-month block of 60%max 6sets x 6 reps 7:3 repeaters. Major "accomplishments" include finally putting down a sixteen-session V7 project, falling off the top on a couple V8 projects at my local bouldering area. Did bottom out a shitty Metolius from 15 feet up and fucked my ankle, and that kept me from squatting/deadlifting/heel hooking at full strength for a good while.
* 2024: Pretty much more of 2023, lots of weekend/extended weekend trips to closer local boulders, trips to Squamish, Joe's, a couple longer trips planned for RR and Bishop soon. Back to one lifting day a week (which gets switched out for light cardio/stretching if I'm feeling wrecked), 2-3x climbing on gym sets or TB2 or a lead endurance session, with sessions being dropped if I'm going outside on the weekend. Slightly better resting tactics before outdoor trips = sending my first V8 at the end of March, and my second V8 and first V9 a few weeks ago.

Currently, I climb with a few different friend groups of varying skill levels outside based on availability and willingness, and often end up just driving myself to my own projects, and sometimes miraculously cross paths with friends I didn't make plans with. Basically, no real consistent crew (at least on rock. People are are more consistent about gym appearances).  
It's been noted by many of my friends that I have "infinite stoke" but having other people that can feed that "stoke" feedback loop, if you will, does make my sessions infinitely more fun, and lately that's been feeling rarer in occassion.

**Catalyst**

To be up front, the biggest impetus for all this (\*gestures vaguely at word dump\*) is that I had the privilege of meeting a few really strong climbers (like V12-13? cruising V11s in a single session type thing) that I really liked/vibed with at the V9 project that I ended up sending, and then getting to climb with them more a bit later on.  
The things that stuck out to me were the observations they made, micro-beta adjustments offered, just straight up beta suggestions that I never would have considered, and genuine stoke. More concretely, with just a little bit of that, in one session, I went from being able to hit a start move on this V8 project maybe once every 50 tries to almost topping it. And from feeling completely shorted on the crux move of a V10  that I was dabbling with to having enough power to overshoot it by a good couple inches.  
Also of note, one of them (based in CO) mentioned they get outside 3x a week consistently year round, which sounds like a dream, where I get weekends in fall/spring assuming weather isn't atrocious, and have to travel otherwise.

So I guess all that is to say...  
**TL;DR** Met, vibed, and sessioned with some crushers, the experience made me feel like I got better just by being around them, on top of it just being a good time, and made me wonder if getting that more consistently (and getting outside more consistently, importantly) would improve my climbing at a faster rate.  
Would moving potentially bring me closer to making that a reality? Or am I just looking for a shortcut when I could achieve all that without making such a big life change?  
\*\*I have the ability to work remote full-time (though I do not currently), and do not have an SO to consider, which makes the moving thing kind of tempting as an idea since there aren't any major blockers.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading, let me know your thoughts!
ClimbHarder Hall of Fame V2: Submit and vote on your favorite posts/discussions! So there's a neat little place on the sidebar here called the [Hall of Fame (aka Master Sticky)](https://old.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/4gv89d/climbharder_master_sticky/). Unfortunately, it's almost a decade old now! It's time we update it with the "most interesting and helpful discussions had on this site." 

I have a personal collection of posts/discussions saved from here I'd like to add as contenders, but I’d love for y'all to pitch in with your favorite discussions and posts as well. Anything from training deep dives to philosophical rants to retrospectives to spicy disagreements and such. 

I think we could also do with having a few broad categories to keep it from being a single, largely unorganized list like the last one (no offense /u/straightCrimpin).

**How can you help?**

- Share your favorites: Drop any posts or threads you think should be in the Hall of Fame in the comments.

- Categories?: Should we break this down by topic—training, mental game, injuries, technique, community moments etc? Or just stick with a single, big list?
    
- Comprehensive or concise?: Should this list be exhaustive, or would a more curated "best of the best" approach make it both more readable and valuable?

Anyhow, in no particular order (and in addition to what's already in the HoF)...

----------------------

I'm realizing now I'm definitely missing some discussions I never saved. Oh well.
What will three months off DO to me I may need to get chest surgery at some point next year. I've been climbing for about a year and a half and I'm obsessed with it-- I've also only recently gotten into going outdoor bouldering and learning lead outside, which is incredible. I'm broken up about the surgeon saying it'll be three months (most likely) before I can climb hard again. (He laughed when I said I'm a climber and told me "unfortunately that's probably the worst sport to be into for this".) Especially since the surgery being to my chest means when I'm recovering, I can't train any pulling or pushing cause I'll stretch the scarring, no hangboarding either since it's my understanding that arms overhead is the most strenuous position. But I really don't want to lose all my strength and be struggling on stuff I could do easily before, especially because I struggle with getting pissed off at myself for not being able to send. Is there anything I can do? How long would it take to get back to where I was? Is my ascent of silence doomed?
Overcoming crisis - an adapted framework from Jared Diamond Warning - long post. May not be relevant for everyone.

As a preface, I am by no means an elite climber. I have climbed up to V8 on a board, with the moonboard and TB2 being my favourite out of all of them. I do not get outdoors much because there is no rock in my country. I have been climbing for 10 years with many (months - years) breaks in between due to various life circumstances.

I recently finished Jared Diamond's "upheaval", a book on how various nations have overcome crises and the factors behind why they were able to do so. He came up with a framework to analyze these factors and uses it to make some predictions on the outcome of current world crises. Interestingly, I think this framework can be quite applicable to many climbers, including myself, who undergo a "crisis" in our performance. This is my attempt at applying this framework to my own climbing, and a note on how it has helped me. It may or may not be useful for some people, and it may be utter rubbish, but I thought I would share it anyway. Everyone knows how to train, but I think we all could learn a thing or two about overcoming adversity.

These are the 12 factors:

**1. Acknowledgement one is in crisis**

- I think you can replace the word "crisis" with "having an injury", or "being in a plateau", or "not hitting performance goals" etc.

- For me, some "crises" which I have acknowledged about my climbing this year are:

* I have had dealt with two pulley injuries and two separate bouts of terrible elbow tendinopathy. I am currently injury-free.
*  I am not climbing as well as I think I should be, and i am not making as much progress as I would like given my training age.

**2. Accept responsibility**

- This is pretty easy in the context of climbing because... no one else is responsible for your training and your performance except yourself. Unless you are a professional climber, but even so.

- Injured? It's either the result of poor training practices, or too much volume, or lack of recovery, or too much too soon etc etc.. or a combination of all of it. No matter what, you are responsible for it and identifying what went wrong. 

**3. Delineating problems**

- This refers to delineating between things that require change and those that are better being preserved. Just because one is in a crisis, it doesn't mean that your entire training needs to be overhauled.

- For example, I am good with things that supplement my recovery, such as sleep and nutrition.

- One example of something I changed, was that I do way too much strength/supplemental training and I was unknowingly impacting my recovery burden (despite having good recovery practices). I now do much less, and I continue to make gains and more importantly remain injury free.

- I also now am quite selective of what sort of climbing I choose to do. Unfortunately, where I live, the style of setting indoors is quite compy, with big slopey holds that require a lot of overall body strength and compression etc, not many crimps, and importantly, put a heinous amount of stress on the elbow and shoulder joints which my body does not agree with at my current conditioning level. Which is a problem for me, and also something within my control.

- I now shift my intense training sessions to the board because while they are more taxing on the fingers, they do not stress my elbows and shoulders the way that the gym sets do. I reserve the gym sets for easier days. To be honest this has been beneficial because I have been weak in the fingers (or perhaps uncoordinated) for a long time anyway due to them being under-trained on the gym sets. A downside is that I am not good in a compy style and would definitely benefit from doing them more. But there is also a limit to how much I am willing to risk injury to become more proficient in this style. 

**4. Getting help from others**

- Pretty self explanatory. For climbing I suppose most people could benefit from a good coach, but not everybody wants one. Myself included.

**5. Using others as models**

- Again, also pretty self explanatory. Look for people who have faced similar circumstances. How have they dealt with or overcome it?

- I think this is also important because climbing is a sport that seems to be growing younger by the year. 10 years ago I would be one of the youngest in the gym, climbing with people much older than myself. Now when I enter a climbing gym, I'm one of the oldest (and I'm not even that old!!). 

- I acknowledge that a lot of the young people are stronger than me and can climb harder than me, but it would be foolish to take training advice from them most of the time. On the other hand, I feel no shame asking them for technical advice when I need it. There is this one kid who is an incredibly intuitive climber and I look up to his style and technical ability, but he also told me that rubbing his fingers under running water helps to heal his pulley injuries so.. go figure.

**6. Importance of Identity**

- Not super relevant, but perhaps one thing to say about this particular point is that for a lot of us, it may not be simply enough to identify as a climber but also to identify as an athlete.

**7. Honest self-appraisal**

- To be honest, out of ALL the points, THIS. THIS is the most important one. I think goal setting also falls under this point because we need to be honest about our goal setting as well. They need to be realistic and achievable, and how we go about attaining those goals also requires honest self appraisal. For me personally, I want to climb V9 both on a board and outdoors next year, which I think is a realistic goal. I know i am strong enough, it's just a matter of polishing up current weaknesses in my technique. I'm not good at toe hooks. I used to be bad at heel hooks but i can say now i'm fairly strong in them. My hips could be more flexible. I could be better at generating power with my legs. I have a bad habit of re-adjusting on holds. I could be better at keeping my hips into the wall when generating movement (I am a lanky fella).

These are some honest self appraisals that I have applied to my own climbing:

* Due to previous sporting background, I really don't need to do that much supplemental strength and conditioning and I should spend less time on it. 
* What feels like a plateau is really just a result of inconsistent climbing.
* I'm not as strong as I used to be and cannot tolerate the same training volume that I used to when I was younger. But this does not mean i cannot improve, it just means i need to be smarter about my programming.
* I do not need any supplemental finger training if i am board climbing 2-3 times a week. It has only resulted in tweaks for me.
* I need to learn to say no and stick to my own training plans when friends ask me to climb together, or try a new set etc.
* I need to stop avoiding climbs that I do not find "fun" and not my style if I wish to push my climbing further and become a better climber. I can be better at embracing discomfort.
* I'm way, way less technically proficient than I thought I was and I give up too easily on moves that I can actually do if i just try it more and learn the movement.

**8. Past experience**

- Drawing on past experiences can give you confidence that you can overcome adversity again. I have rehabbed injuries multiple times earlier on in my climbing journey, and so even though injuries are incredibly inconvenient, they will happen, and I know that I can get back to previous levels and even go beyond.

**9. Patience with failure**

- Issues with climbing performance, injury etc are invariably complex. One modification may work for one climber and not the next. It's important to try different solutions and be tolerant of failure. 

- Climbing is a long game

**10. Organisational Flexibility**

- I feel like this is a straightforward but very important point that frequently comes up in coaching advice.

- We need to be able to modify the training plan of a given day if for some reason the original plan is no longer feasible. 

- E.g, your usual warm up feels like an RPE 8/10 when it should feel much much easier. You're fatigued. You were supposed to do a power endurance session. Instead of pushing through and embarking on a session which you are ill-prepared for, you should have the flexibility to do something else and alter the training load and intensity etc. 

- I do think your training intuition takes time to develop. I feel like this is one of those times where having a coach could conceivably be really beneficial.  

- I think this ties in with the point above as well, because there are some days where you just feel like ass and you'll have to wait and come back another day to try your proj.

**11. Values**

- I don't think this really matters in this context. just don't be a dick at the crag I guess.

12. Freedom from external factors

- In the book, Jared Diamond is referring to how countries experience varying degrees of limitations on their ability to overcome crises based on geographical, political and financial constraints etc.

- In terms of climbing, I feel like these limitations also exist in varying degrees. For example - my country has literally zero outdoor climbing. This is a HUGE constraint for outdoor performance. It's incredibly humid and conditions are terrible year round, even for climbing indoors. Neither of these are in my control.

- One should be able to delineate what external factors are avoidable, and what are not

- For example, I am in total control of what I want my sessions to look like, my nutrition, how much sleep I get, saying no to friends and saying no to the new fun set etc. 

  
**Conclusion**

Most of this is just my own personal blabbering and self appraisal of my own climbing but to be honest, it's really helped me put my current climbing performance into perspective and ground me in my current climbing ability. It's also helped me to structure my training practices in a way that aligns with my own performance goals. It's also helped me reflect on what I have been doing that has led me to this point and reinforce good practices that I have discovered over time, because I am at a place in my climbing where I am happy with my performance, I feel strong, and i feel well equipped to become a better climber.
drastic improvement Two months back, over the summer, I would climb on the kilter board a lot, sometimes in the gym and sometimes on the moonboard too. I would project v8s on the kilter, and v9s always felt like a cut above, and the moves were out of my skill range. Recently, I cut down on the climbing I've been doing because of upcoming exams, so up until this week I hadn't kiltered or been to a commercial gym in around 2 months. 

  
That being said, I have been weight training in the gym, as well as climbing at my school gym. I picked up a pulley injury and TPCC injury these past couple months anyways, so I have not been training or climbing that hard.

  
However, coming back to the kilter this week, I've noticed a drastic improvement. Not just that but a lot of my old projects are going down. I am flasshing 8s and sent a couple 9s. Most 9s are well within my capability now, it's just a matter of linking. Comparative to my friends (with whom I climb very regularly) who used to be the same level or better than me, I am now properly a cut above them.

I am really confused as to why I improved. The only noticeable changes I could possibly think of was letting my fingers heal, doing weight training (I pushed my weighted pull up to 35kg at 58kg bw), and also I began taking creatine and protein powder a few months back. 

I want to understand better how my body works, so I can improve in the future. My improvement has been far from linear since I only started climbing 1.5 years ago, so I am still very foreign to what sort of training actually works best for me. Any similar experiences or advice?
Non-training question - how do I get FASTER at climbing? especially trad One component of climbing harder is about climbing faster. And I'm not talking about being like adam ondra and spending less than 1.2 seconds per hold so I'm not running up the pump clock. I'm talking about keeping the pace moving on long multi-pitch routes.

Usually when I climb I'm meticulous and careful, I'm spending time picking the best footholds, puzzling out the best/most secure way to do the next move or sequence. I do this even if it's moderate, because the consequences of a fall are bad; and if it's harder then I do it because I need to. On a harder route, I will milk a rest hold or stance as long as possible because I don't know what's coming next and going into it with anything less than full recovery is "risky."

I feel like I move slowly, but I have no way to objectively measure that. I guess I could start timing my pitch leads vs. my partners pitch leads and see if I'm consistently slower on average? 

I definitely climb a LOT faster when seconding compared to leading but this probably applies to everyone. That suggests its a mental thing; I'm able to figure out the moves and am just spending time convincing myself to do them when leading. Or, I'm allowing myself to take "riskier" moves on TR (maybe I use a less-secure smear instead of spending time hunting for that slightly more positive nub)

A big piece of it is definitely mental. And maybe there are also technical skills of moving faster I could work on. But what are they and how?

I don't think the problem is gear placement or belay transitions or anything like that. Of course there's always room for improvement there, but I have lots of experience and the places I notice are in the movement.

what has your experience been with this or did it just come naturally? I have many years of climbing experience and this has been a weakness of mine for a long time.
Thought this was interesting in context of climbing - rapid V17 repeats and FAs; more female grade barriers being broken after a major one is achieved, even just seeing your buddy stick the crux of your proj
The quiet eye - one of the few cheat codes in sport The quiet eye is a concept defined by its originator Joan Vickers as "the final fixation or tracking gaze that is located on a specific location or object in the task space within 3° of visual angle (or less) for a minimum of 100 ms." This (https://ciss-journal.org/article/view/7519/10521) article explains it better and more in-depth than I ever could, but I'll try to summarize the important bits. The concept was developed from eye tracking data of elite performers in multiple sports. When compared to near-elite or average competitors elite athletes tend to spend significantly more time with their eyes static on one position before performing a motion. This is consistent through many different sports and types of motions. As I understand it the theory is it increases the task relevant information that is gathered, which helps prime more specific movement patterns, as well as increasing focus. There is no consensus on exactly what's happening though. Whatever the reason, it is clearly related to being consistently accurate in movements. Better yet, research seems to indicate that training the quiet eye can increase performance in non-elite athletes. This meta-analysis (https://idus.us.es/bitstream/handle/11441/53483/Quiet%20eye%20(Versi%F3n%20aceptada).pdf;jsessionid=9356C25E8CAAD0E375BE0D79D1BF656B?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) goes more in-depth on the topic.

I learned about this idea a few months ago and have been trying to integrate it into my climbing. I focus primarily on competition climbing, so my training includes a lot of dynamic practice.

What I started doing was first trying to maximize the information I have before I start the dyno by finding the angle of holds and statically reaching to the goal to gauge the distance I will need to jump. Then I spend specific time fixing my gaze on my feet, then hands, and finally the goal hold or goal position before maintaining that gaze as I actually move.

I think to some degree most of us already do this, but by making it a conscious decision I have noticed massive improvement in my ability. I am able to do more complicated movements than I could before and am much faster at learning new movements. I also feel more comfortable repeating difficult dynos, and the time it takes to reach the point where I can nail them every time has decreased noticeably.

I'd love to hear other's experience with this concept and opinions on how well it applies to climbing.
i miss my love for this sport apologies in advance, this post is kind of a mess. posted here because i figured you guys more than anyone else would understand a love for taking this sport seriously, but if it’s the wrong place please LMK and i’ll take it down



TLDR: in a funk, looking for feedback/ideas from those w/ similar experiences



i’m just going through the motions. i know at one point i enjoyed this sport, enjoyed the grind, the sense of progression and knowledge i was good at something unique. even simpler, i had fun. i had fun climbing with friends, fun training hard, fun trying the ungraded problems and falling on climbs i had no business starting. i don’t anymore. i’m better now, at least that’s what my grade and benchmarks tell me, but i certainly don’t feel it. 

while i’m improved in the sense of sending harder climbs, it’s hard to attribute that to anything other than increasingly soft grading - i’ve done nothing right to warrant the recent ‘jump’ i’ve made from v8 -> 9, almost 10. i don’t hangboard anymore, don’t lift, don’t stretch, don’t train boards, hell i don’t even really climb anymore. i show up, erg for a few minutes and half ass my projecting before calling it quits. i don’t look forward to trying hard anymore; by and large if i can’t send something with at most 40% effort, i lose interest and move on. that feeling probably left me a while ago, but i haven’t noticed until now. 

the peer comparisons certainly don’t help. since i got serious about climbing back in 2021, i’ve watched most of my former teammates and friends (yes, unfortunately was a team kid) surpass me, some starting as recently as a year ago. one went on to compete in MYA nationals. more than anything else, it’s incredibly depressing to consider the time i’ve wasted not taking this sport seriously; doing the bare minimum to maintain what little strength/skill i’ve still got. 

while i’ve had some short periods of growth in the past year and whatever since i’ve slipped into this funk, they’ve never lasted more than a few weeks, and have always ended with me worse off than i was before. had a 10 i was working a few months ago - first time in forever spending more than a few sessions on a climb, and i wanted it so bad i started getting myself back into my training routine. started caring about what i ate and how i recovered and started stretching after sessions. i started looking forward to going in again. and so naturally, earth treks said ‘fuck you!’ and pulled the rug out from under, resetting it on a weekend i was out of town. i’ve since them slipped back into my crappy climbing, going from three times to twice to once a week, if that. there’s a real sense of dread i feel on the drive over, nothing i’ve felt before. maybe it’s the fact i simply don’t give a shit about any of the setting, the knowledge i’m wasting time i could be spending on school or work on what’s going to be a mediocre session, or the truth that i’m only still here because of the fear of losing what i’ve got right now and knowing i’ll never pick it up again, that any break will be permanent- i’ll never have the energy to get back to where i am now from nothing. it’s a sunk cost, and right now i’m riding it down to the bottom
Doctor who wrote Nova Scotia’s climbing guide is releasing amazing videos on training I think you guys will love this. The video before this in the series went through the anatomy of the hand and what muscles we need with a hand surgeon. This video goes over types of training needed for different energy systems. It told me why I’ve plateaud so hard!

What are things that you have consistently found to be helpful to your climbing and vice-versa (consistently unhelpful)? Similar previous thread for reference: [https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/8fx4u1/what\_is\_one\_nonclimbing\_exercise\_that\_you\_were/](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/8fx4u1/what_is_one_nonclimbing_exercise_that_you_were/)

Hi all, similar to the previous thread from 7yrs ago, I was curious about some newer thoughts. Lots of new training protocols and fads have been explored in climbing and tons of new members in the sub.   
  
What are some things you have found consistently helpful/unhelpful after implementing a cycle or two and why? Is it something you always include now? Can be climbing specific or auxiliary if it resulted in improved climbing.

For example:

Pinch block training: unhelpful - I've done a few cycles over the years and yes, I end the cycle being able to pinch more weight, but it never feels like it translates well to actual climbs. I think pinching that occurs on problems is actually pretty dissimilar to block training, almost always feels like a different skill and set of strength.

Daily low weight no-hangs (inspired by Emils Routine): helpful - Started trying this after some finger injuries (not from climbing) and seeing it get popular a while back. I found keeping the weight really low and doing like 30-60sec hangs for a few sets, enough to feel the fingers get warm, helped with rehab. Maybe an obvious result but now anytime my fingers feel tweaky (every couple of months), I do this routine for a week or two and they feel better.

Thanks!
Quantitative Research on the "Abrahangs" Hey everyone, just listened to a video that Emil Abrahamsson and Keith Baar did on the Struggle Climbing Podcast talking about their recent study quantitatively investigating the effect of the "Abrahangs," or 10 minutes of hangboarding at very light loads, twice a day. Video here: [https://youtu.be/8hXfvFuA\_6E?si=nQPzdF6BBPWHvorU](https://youtu.be/8hXfvFuA_6E?si=nQPzdF6BBPWHvorU) 

Hopefully this gets published relatively soon as they have a pretty clear finding, but for those who don't want to listen to the whole podcast, here's a summary:

* They retrospectively looked at logged data on the crimpd app. They identified users that did two max hang tests within at least 16 weeks of each other. These users were categorized into four groups:
   *  Group 1: Either low frequency (less than three times a week for no hangs, or less than or equal to twice a week for max hangs) or logged no training routine ("just climbing" protocol)
   * Group 2: Just no hangs (no hangs logged >3 times a week and max hangs <= 2 times a week)  
   * Group 3: Just max hangs (no hangs logged < 3 times a week, max hangs > 2 times a week)
   * Group 4: Both max hangs and no hangs at high frequency (>3 times a week no hang, > 2 times a week max hang).
* They didn't give defined group sizes, but they mentioned each group had around 100 people for a total study size of 600. Baar also mentions that there were more people in the just max hangs than the just no hangs group, so if I had to guess group 1 and group 3 may have had more people than group 2 and 4.
* Their primary finding is that group 1 had a negligible improvement, group 2 and group 3 had a statistically indistinguishable improvement, and group 4 had an additive improvement relative to group 2 and 3.
   * They mentioned that group 2 had an effect size of about 0.3 and group 3 had an effect size of 0.45, which are both moderate efficacy. The greater effect in group 3 was explained by a greater number of climbers in group 3, but regardless, the difference was not statistically significant.
   * The additive effect of group 4, meaning that if you add the mean effect of group 2 and group 3 you get the mean effect of group 4, is explained by the fact that the increases in strength between the two methods use different mechanisms that don't overlap that much. Group 2 is focusing on tendon health and resilience while group 3 is focusing on muscle recruitment.
* They acknowledge that with a retrospective study like this, you can't control for a lot of relevant variables, but they vaguely referenced that these were experienced climbers based on their grade logged in the crimpd app. They are planning a prospective study in which they can recruit participants and control things like load and time under tension to see if there's any effect on the result.

Some pretty interesting insights here, and quantitative data is always great! Curious as to what you all think.
Potentially unpopular opinion: the autobelay is a great way for lower intermediate climbers to improve I've climbed for about 4 years now and have always sucked considering the frequency with which I climb. When I climb regularly, about twice a week, I plateau at 5c/5c+.

Around 6 months ago my work meant I could only go to the gym when my climbing partners are at work, and my workouts went from lead to autobelay, and honestly it's been great, I think for two reasons:

1. It increases endurance tenfold because on the autobelay hangdogging isn't possible - if you fall you have to start again, so on each route you really go until failure, not just until you need a break. 

2. Despite this, theres no 'fear' of falling, because theres nobody underneath you with a grigri. This means you start doing whatever you can, including quite advanced movements, on the more difficult moves. Most of them are probably very bad technique, but there are certain movements and positions that I'd never have started putting myself in just doing lead.

Yesterday i went to a crag and was climbing routes that 6 months ago would never have been possible, and realised on a bunch of occasions that i was using specific movements and positions that I've learned on the autobelay. I onsighted a bunch of 6a routes and got up a 6a+ if somewhat messily.

So yeah, nothing to say other than that. If you're a lower intermediate climber, warming up on circuits and then autobelaying until failure could be a great idea.
Struggling with a lifetime as a mediocre climber First off, this is mostly just a rant, though I'd welcome any insights.

I'm male, mid thirties. I started climbing on a youth team around 12, in the pea-gravel days of gyms. I was pretty decent, but I didn't really appreciate what climbing v5/5.11 at 15 meant when I was surrounded by kids going to Worlds. Got into some trouble in my late teens and climbing fell by the wayside. When I came back to climbing at 26, I did so with a ton of excitement to excel again. Sport climbed primarily for many years, in the past 3-4 years have moved more to bouldering. 

When I came back to climbing, I tried to foster a more holistic relationship with the sport. Focusing on outdoor climbing, being more focused on enjoying time outside and adventures. That said, I have always enjoyed pushing myself and seeing what grades I could get to, it's just never had my ultimate focus as I balance it with trail running, snowboarding, etc on top of career and life. I climb a little harder every year, but haven't pushed past V7/ mid 5.12. I understand an immense amount of the science of training and periodically commit to training cycles, though inevitably life, work, travel, and other sports compete with a sole focus on climbing. I'll also admit I can never commit to much more than a mini project, a couple sessions here and there. For the most part I've been pretty OK with the rhythm I have and how much awesome stuff I get to climb within the grades I can. I also enjoy my strong relationship with the community, crag stewardship, and my ability to act as a mentor to new climbers.

Recently though I've been hanging with a lot of extremely strong climbers, and as they say, comparison is the thief of joy. Yesterday I chatted a lesser known pro who climbed in the same youth circuit as me, who also took a shorter, but still significant break. She's climbing v14 now, and I sure did not feel great after discussing our shared past and seeing her warm up on my limit, even if she was very cool about it. I guess I just find myself wondering a lot lately, how TF do some people get so strong? I know commitment is part of it, but am I missing something else?

TLDR: I've been climbing my whole life but just never gotten particularly good, but always been alright with that. After some recent conversations, I'm bumming a bit as I wonder what it is that makes some people so strong that I can't seem to tap into?
Nova Scotia Dr. shows revolutionary individually customized 3d printed finger training tool His “hand of god” tool with the little rollers looks amazing for multiple reasons. Lack of pressure point from small edge more skin/pain friendly, seeming reduced reliance on friction removes conditions variable, the caps preventing fingers curling further over top forcing strict consistent finger position. It seems like he will attempt to release instructions how to measure your hands, and designs for 3d printing. Excited to see where this goes , I know I’ll be trying my damndest to get my hands on one of these to train my open hand crimping for Squamish crystals!
Lessons from another year of plateau and how im going to finally overcome it. The year is coming to a close,  although i'm not happy with my climbing progress I am happy with the lessons i've learnt and feel like I have a strong plan for breaking through this plateau.

# Reasons for my plateau

Im highly motivated in climbing and I love doing it. I regularly climb for 3 times a week, I try and train my body's strength, my technique, my fingers and my mobility. I've had periods of gains and losses over two years but no real progress. I have thought a lot this year about why that is the case and have hard frustrating times of low progress. These are my conclusions.

**1. Poorly targeted motivation and use of my energy during my training.** 

**2. An unhealthy and damaging relationship with progress, goals, and "where I should be at" and the progress I "should be making".** 

**3. A poor relationship with my body.**

**4. A poor execution strategy on outdoor sessions.**

  
These three reasons internal issues have resulted in following cyclic behaviour over my plateau. 

1.  A strong motivation to get better. Strong desire to increase my grade and to keep making progress. A strong dissatisfaction with my progress.

2. Throwing myself into training. Hard. Everything was always every session. Either board climbing, max hangs, pull up training. I would climb hard and push myself.

3. I would see quick progress over the short term, I'd feel strong and good. I would keep up the intensity and think Im finally on the correct path.

4. I would start feeling an overuse injury. I would ignore it and push past it.

  
5. During an outdoor trip I would push even harder. Resulting in an injury.

6. I de-load, attempt to rehab and gradually start building back up. 

7. I become frustrated at the slowness and lack of progress. I am frustrated at the "lost time".  I become highly motivated to get better, to make progress. I identify a weakness. I attempt to train it. **I move back to step 1.**

This cycle has repeated itself over the last two years, roughly with a period of 4 months. The result in this is a periodic pattern in my strength, my time in which i'm able to climb (improve technique), and my happiness in the sport. The result of this cycle? **A plateau.** 

**To break the plateau I need to break the cycle.**



\--------------------------------------------------

# Lessons learnt and principles gained

\--------------------------------------------------

There is a mixture here, some  lead to actionable rules in terms of intensity, rest and exercise selection. (getting stronger). Whereas others aim more about approach to climbing and give actionable rules for improving technique.

# Seek Consistency over Motivation

My primary lesson and now leading principle in my training is to **seek consistency over motivation**. Or in other words, **aim to be consistent rather than aiming to get better**. The progress will take care of itself. This is where I will direct my energy and passion.

if over the last few years I took "sessions of uninjured training" as the metric for a successful training cycle Im convinced I would have made significantly more progress and had significantly less injuries. This will be my goal. To achieve this i'm going to incorporate the following rules.

\- Build a strong base before attempting to add weight and train maximum strength.

\- Do not train any muscle group / tendon hard every session. At most twice a week. 

\- take regular deload weeks every 4-6 weeks.

\- If I am feeling injury or overuse. Stop the set. Deload and reassess progression. Seek the consistency over the short term gain.

I will pay particular attention to my injury prone regions. 

# Address your my injuries and Listen to your Body

One of my successes from this year is rehabbing a recurring hamstring injury that prevented me from fully utilising and being confident in my heel hooks. I was able to find a great physio who gave me a structured and gradual training plan to improve my strength in my hamstring. This has resulted in my gaining confidence back in my heel hooks and given me a set of exercises to keep doing.

My wrists and fingers (pip synovitis) are also injury prone regions. 

For each injury I will attempt to seek physio and gradually build a new strength base for them before seeking maximal strength and power gains. This will not only give me more confidence in their use but be a strong step in allowing consistency in training. 

In order to prevent further injuries I will learn to listen to my body and build a better relationship with it. It knows best. It knows when I am pushing it too much. **It is not the servant to my mind but the companion of it.**

"Your body will perform better if it doesnt resent what you are doing to it".

Additionally I plan to dedicate an additional gym session focused on rehab not strength gains.  Will focus on my hamstrings, wrists and shoulders.

# Seek Mastery Over Completion

I rarely repeat a climb. **I am usually happy to tick it off and see it as a mark of progress and ability**. But each climb should be a training opportunity. I should seek to learn something from each, repeating them until I am happy with my performance on them. 

This is particular important on climbs that are hard and that I have fallen off on. Not only will it give me more volume on sport specific movements that I may be physically weak in, but it will give me vital familiarity and confidence on techniques that I can improve upon.

When falling of a climb I will ask myself **"Why did I fall off, and what could I have done to make that movement easier**" 

My ability to identify which techniques i'm bad and good at is a lot worse than my ability to identify which positions and movements i'm strong in. Climbing is a skill based sport so it is important that I try and improve this.

I should repeat my hard climbs until each move is intentional and clean.

# Identify and Train your Weaknesses.

Training strengths is fun and rewarding. I enjoy training my max pull-up but realistically it is at a sufficient level and not holding me back. 

  
I know that my hangs and grip strength is weak. I know that I am weak in wide positions. They are undertrained and I will benefit more from training those.  
  
My number one priority strength wise is my finger strength. I can only hang around 120% of bodyweight. (This puts me well below average for my outdoor grade V6 [data here](https://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/climb-harder-data) ). I have been unable to improve this over the year due to the cycle mentioned above.

But importantly before I address this I need to be build up a strong injury free base.  
I am currently incorporating finger roles (high rep low weight) and regular low weight pickups in an attempt to do this.

#  Practice How You Mean to Perform

  
In the gym I rarely read a route and prefer just to climb it**,** figuring it out as I go**.** This works because setters are good. There is often a hold where I expect it. Setters want the movement to flow and feel natural.   
Only when am I stuck on a climb to I attempt to read from the ground, I often find I lack the visual awareness to predicate how my body will fit amongst the holds. I do not have enough practise.  
  
Outdoor climbs do not have this predetermined flow, additionally they do not obvious holds. I **find I often waste a lot of my energy and skin on figuring out the beta**. I am unsure on when to stick to a beta, when to try something new. The result of this is that when I have found a beta that works and im dialled in on it, I am often too exhausted to send. It may be some months before I return to the boulder at which point I need to re-familiarise myself with the rock.

I need to practice my route reading. I need to repeat routes that I have already climbed intentionally. I need to try and send my climbs initially in as few attempts as possible. I need to learn not just to look at the hand sequence but the foot and body sequence as well.

This will improve my outdoor execution and allow me to reach a confident dialed in state with more energy and skin in the tank.

**Your Daily Life Matters**

Some of the people I know who have progressed the fastest and with the least injuries are those who have an active and varied physical daily life, gardeners, landscapers and anyone who's on their feet, moving through different positions and holding a variety of different items.

On the other hand, many of us, including myself, spend the majority of the working day in one sitting positions, with the wrists and fingers held in one position and used at minimal intensity.   
This paired with the intensity and specificity of climbing can lead to an injury prone body. 

**I am now trying actively trying to incorporate movement, throughout the day and throughout my body at a range of intensities**. This is a simple and healthy change to make that I hope will help reduce the risk of injury.

**Journal and Plan**  
This is a personal one but I have seen a lot of success in terms of consistency by simply keeping an exercise journal. I find it motivating and satisfying to look back on and it allows me to plan a session ahead of time. 

  
Its particularly useful for projects. Before I leave an outdoor project I now attempt to write down the beta in as much detail as possible.



# Conclusion

My main goals can be summed up as to **"train in a way that promotes consistency and gradual growth whilst systematically addressing injuries and weaknesses."**

**I**m hoping by adressing this I can keep a steady training cadence throughout the year and be more confident in my abilities and body. **Sending harder will only be a natural consequence of this.**
"You have to try harder climbs to send harder climbs" I've heard this advice a lot, but I'm curious, for anyone who applies this, how far you take it? Does this mean falling off of projects, or does it mean trying things you know you won't be able to send even as a project?

My hardest climbs so far have been v7. Some v7s have gone down in two sessions, some its taken me more like 4-5, and some feel pretty out of reach. Usually when i've pulled onto the moves of anything v8 or harder, I'm lucky if I can do one move. Are some of you out there trying things that are so hard that when you first get on them you can't do any moves?

TO APPEASE THE AUTOMODERATOR:

V7 climber, been climbing most of my life, 10 years more seriously/consistently, climb about 5 days a week with 3-4 indoor sessions and 1-2 outdoor. Looking to more consistently climb v7 and move into v8-9. I have done research on this question in the sense that I know even professional climbers at v17 don't consistently climb v17 and still have to project easier climbs. I've even seen pros that climb v14 fall off v9 in the gym. The question of "how much harder you can climb that what you've currently sent" is nuanced and varies from person to person and approach to approach, and I'm trying to get a broader spectrum of opinions.
A 7-Year Retrospective: Seven Things I Did Right *Following my last retrospective from a few years ago* [*(things I wish I knew earlier)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/vx55uz/a_5year_retrospective/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)*, here’s a follow-up post focusing on things that I did right since I started climbing seven years ago.*

**1. You're not climbing enough**

“Just Climb” isn’t just some catchy mantra—it’s a wake-up call. It’s about realizing how little time you’re actually spending doing the act of climbing. Once you start logging your sessions—whether training or outdoors—you might be surprised by how little actual climbing you’re doing.

For my boulderers: how much time is spent loitering between burns, waiting for your turn, or engaging in the social banter that we all love? When you’re outside, it’s even more stark: total time under tension for an entire day is probably less than 15 minutes. And in sport climbing? I too often see climbers outdoors casually knock out two or three leads well in their comfort zone and call it a day. For perspective, Alex Honnold bags 100-pitch days -- the same amount of pitches the average climber does over an entire year.

The reality is we often think we’re climbing more than we actually are.

A friend of mine, who’s climbed 5.14 for years, shared her “lucky number” with me: she aims for at least eight sport routes per day, every time she’s out. That includes warmups, moderates, limit attempts, and a cooldown. She’s kept this practice for two decades, and you can imagine how that consistency compounds over time.

Another example: When bouldering indoors, I don’t let myself leave the gym without climbing a minimum of ten V8s or harder on the Kilter.

If you haven’t already, start keeping a log of your climbs. Tools like Mountain Project, [8a.nu](http://8a.nu), TheCrag, or even the Kilter Board app are underrated for visualizing your actual volume—and they’ll often reveal just how little mileage you’re accumulating.

“Just Climb” means accepting that most of us aren’t climbing as much as we think we are. Confront that gap and recognizing the discipline, motivation, and time management it takes to truly increase your volume. Leveling up doesn't necessarily mean climbing more days per week—it’s about climbing more in each session. Build the habit. Stop faffing around.



**2. Never be more than two weeks away**

Climbing is a sport that rewards consistency and mercilessly punishes irregularity. To keep progressing, you need to know your baseline fitness and make it a rule to never stray more than two weeks away from it.

Life will always get in the way of climbing. Whether it’s a vacation, work, family, or just feeling down physically or mentally, it’s normal to be interrupted and to take breaks. But the key is to avoid letting those breaks stretch too long. Two weeks (or whatever limit feels right to you) should be your hard, non-negotiable maximum.

Why? Because beyond that point, you’re not just dealing with fatigue or feeling rusty—you risk falling into the dreaded inactivity hole. That’s when muscle atrophy, waning psych, and a weakened mind-body connection analgesically combine to derail both your past training and your limit climbing.

While it is certaintly risky to dig yourself a fatigue hole and not rest enough, even worse is in my experience is to claw back from deep inactivity. And the longer the break, the steeper the climb back to where you were—and the more outsized the effort required to undo the damage.

So next time you feel yourself letting go, remind yourself of your limit of time away from climbing. Treat it like a safeguard, a way to keep your momentum alive even when entropy takes ahold of your schedule. Consistency means making time for something you care about.



**3. Do your homework**

Every strong climber I know puts in the work before they even step foot at the crag. Climbing days aren’t just about waltzing up to random routes or boulders (unless that’s the kind of surprise day you long for). If you want to make the most of your time, have a plan, a backup plan, and a mental map of what your day could look like.

*What if your project is wet? What if you’re having a high gravity day? What if your project is swarmed by ten other climbers?*

1. Planning ahead means knowing what kind of day are you looking to have. Are you there to cruise through a stack of moderates or to make progress on a single crux of your project? Think about this *before* you even wake up—it’s the mental reflection that sets the tone for your session. If you’re projecting, break it down into clear goals: are you linking two sections or dialing the redpoint cruxes? Or, maybe your focus is purely supporting your climbing partner, hanging their draws, and maintaining their psych for their project. Whatever it is, be intentional about it. Too many people don't know what their plan is at the crag.

2. Tactics go beyond climbing tactics. They also include ways to save time, energy, and skin:

* *Download/screenshot the topo.* Don’t rely on a signal that might not be there. Don’t regret hopping on the wrong route or not knowing where the start holds to the boulder are. 
* *Scout beta in advance* (for those that need it). Check [8a.nu](http://8a.nu), Mountain Project, or TheCrag for tips on the approach, the route, or the crux. Maybe even download a few beta videos so you can focus directly on solving and not fumbling. DM people if you need to.
* *Save the coordinates*. Whether it’s in your maps or via apps like 27Crags, have your logistics ready to avoid wasting time hunting for trails or starting points. Nothing is worse than boulders that seemingly move around. 
* *Regret-proof your day.* Think ahead about Murphy's law and everything that can go wrong. Got a flapper but no nailclipper? Forgot your toe-hook shoes? Feeling low sugar but outta Haribro? Anticipate what you might need. Your future self will thank you.

The takeaway: good climbing days don’t just happen by chance. They’re built on a foundation of thoughtful preparation. Treat the planning process with as much intention as your sends—you’ll enjoy the day far more and climb better too.



**4. Get Better at Failing**

Climbing is 99% failing—that’s the cliché. But the truth is, every fall is an opportunity to learn, whether it’s your own or someone else’s.

The more I started watching myself on video and intentionally watching others climb, the more I began to understand *why* I was falling. Seeing your core engagement suddenly deactivate mid-move is far more impactful than trying to rely on hazy, adrenaline-fueled memories while you’re out of breath and pumped. Videos don’t lie.

Get better at analyze your falls & failure. Better yet, enlist your climbing partners to watch and give feedback. Ask them to focus on specific parts of your movement, so you can piece together what went wrong.

I’ve had the chance to climb alongside some pro climbers, and one thing they all have in common is that they’re *amazing* at failing. Their relationship with failure is healthy. They’ll repeatedly fall off their hardest attempts without hesitation or self-consciousness. They’re not worried about what anyone else thinks—or even what *they* think—about failing. They acknowledge that the ego is there and work with it.

The climbers who succeed are the ones who fail *better*. They fall, they reflect, and they adapt. Be one of those climbers with positive feedback loops – fall, smile, learn, try better, send!



**5. Check-in on weight**

Weight is a touchy subject in climbing circles, but it’s undeniably something that affects performance. Instead of framing it as “losing weight,” let’s talk about *weight awareness*—understanding how your weight fluctuates, what “mode” your body is in, and how that aligns with your climbing goals.

My weight fluctuates within a range of about 11 lbs (5 kg) over the course of a year. Tracking this and having a sense of my body fat % has helped me better understand how my body operates and how to optimize it for different types of climbing.

Here’s what I’ve learned:

* Performance Phase: I drop a few pounds/kilos when I stop taking creatine before transitioning to performance mode
* Sport Climbing Season: With all the extra mileage and calorie burn, I naturally shed a few pounds in a month when I’m focusing on sport climbing (also I just eat less compared to bouldering shape)
* Bouldering Mode: I tend to lift more and carry slightly more mass while bouldering, as strength gains take priority over staying light; my endurance drops by \~40% but my power endurance takes less of a hit
* Summer Activities: When I’m doing more cardio and outdoor activities, I naturally lean out without any conscious effort

By collecting these data points over time, I’ve built a better understanding of what weight and composition I perform best at for different climbing styles. It’s not about rationing my food or doing 24-hour fasts—it’s about knowing the variables I can tweak to get to my ideal climbing “mode.”

Understanding your body and its fluctuations can help you gauge which levers to pull: nutrition, hydration, alcohol, supplements, mileage, lifting routines, and even rest habits. The key is using weight as a tool to your advantage rather than treating it as a taboo subject.



**6. Carpe Diem (a philosophical interlude)**

*"Because I know that time is time and place is always and only place,*  
*and what is actual is actual only for one time and only for one place,*  
*I rejoice that things are as they are."*  
– T.S. Eliot

Climbing has taught me more about the meaning of *Carpe Diem* more than anything. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve heard climbers say “Next time,” or, “Another day,” after walking away from a climb.

But here’s the truth: there is no “next time.” Every moment at the crag, every climb you attempt, is bound to a singular time and place, never to be repeated. T.S. Eliot’s words echo this Heideggerian truth—each experience is finite, situated in its own irretrievable present.

The 20^(th) century German philosopher Martin Heidegger explored the nature of human existence in his concept of *Dasein*—literally "being there" or "being-in-the-world." Heidegger argued that we are defined by our choices, actions, and our awareness of the finite nature of our lives. Central to his philosophy is the idea of *Sein-zum-Tode*—“being-towards-death”—the acknowledgment that our time is limited and our choices matter deeply.

Climbing is a profound expression of this idea. By choosing *this* route, you are, by necessity, not climbing *that* one. Each decision is an existential act, shaped by the understanding that your time is finite, and every climb carries the weight of opportunity cost.

So what does this mean when you’re at the crag?

It means that if you’ve driven all this way to a boulder or route, don’t waste the day thinking there will be another chance. Don’t punt your send or that you'll get it next try. Don’t tell yourself there’s always “next time.” That mindset assumes an infinite horizon that simply doesn’t exist. We have finite skin, energy, and time.

Every passing day brings you closer to the horizon of your finite being-towards-death. Every climb you don’t try or finish is potentially one you’ll never have the chance to experience again (at the expense of other climbs). The time is now. The place is here. *This* is what matters.

And climbing doesn’t just remind us of our finitude—it invites us to live authentically. Climbing exemplifies this: *doing*, moving, and feeling nature with your hands, your feet, your entire being. When we climb, we embrace life as it truly is: raw, immediate, and inextricably tied to the natural world. The rock is neither an obstacle nor an abstraction; it is simply *there*, and we engage with it fully. This transparency—the clarity of seeing and acting in the world as it is—draws us into an authentic existence.



**7. Imbibe climbing with all the meaning you want, but have a life outside of it**

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had this conversation at the crag or in the forest. You meet another climber, and at some point, they stop, give you that sly smile, and say, “Climbing is such a weird sport, dude.” Then we laugh—because it’s true. Here we are, in the middle of nowhere, scaling rocks after having bushwhacked and taking it just so personally.

Climbing *is* strange. We pour so much meaning and weight into it. To us, it’s sacred—a test of will, an art, and a high like no other. But to those who don’t climb—it’s inherently meaningless. They’ll never quite grasp the feeling of clipping chains when you’re pumped out of your mind, or the blackout send of a hard boulder when even the spotters have gone silent.

Yet, for all its absurdity, climbing has reinforced one singular truth: it’s a meaning-making activity for me. Climbing helps me live fully in the present. It’s my therapy, my dose of serotonin and dopamine, my weekly forest bath. It’s friction under my fingertips and the naked feeling of awe.  
  
And climbing has ruined my life for the absolute best. I’ve become less career-centric and less money-driven. I’ve turned down high-paying jobs, moved continents, and spent so much time in nature that I sometimes wonder what it all adds up to. But it’s added so much value and inner wealth to my life: the connections with wildly interesting, like-minded people who’ve shown me worlds I never knew existed—all united by this strange pursuit where nothing else matters.

That said, I still have never gotten a carabiner tattoo. And I think I did it right by not falling *entirely* down the climbing rabbit hole. I just don't think there's a need to define oneself 100% as a climber in order to love it deeply. If you do define yourself as nothing but a climber, ther'es the risk burning out or becoming disillusioned and spending years trying to reclaim the time and energy you poured into one obsession without nurturing the rest of your life.

As much as I love climbing, there’s more to how I'd like to spend time than just traveling great distances and crimping a tiny edge that no one but you will ever care about. Climbing can be a powerful way to bring meaning into your life—but it shouldn’t be the only meaning.

More on that another time.

Route climber trying to get stronger by next fall. Training review please M27, 5'11", 13a trad and sport, v6, 11years climbing

Justification 

Ok here we go, this past year I finally cracked the 13 ceiling first on bolts, then on gear. The sport route was a pure endurance route no boulder over v4, trad route was a bit more varied but prob topped out at v5. Given my many years of climbing every oz of strength gain really pays off. I attribute this years success in large part to consistently (1/2x per) kilter-boarding. At peak I did 1 v8 and was regularly sending v7 in a few tries. 

Goal   
My goal for year is to generally improve strength with the specific embodiment being increase my non-cheat boulder grade (ie it has to be a pure power problem, no kneebaring, no routes over pads ect). I'd be nice to hit v8(outside) but consolidating v7 would be great too. 

Plan   
I return from a trip to Patagonia in mid Jan and will start training in feb. Im going to skip the spring sport season to train, hopefully send something hard on bolts around Sept then pivot to trad for the remainder of the season. The plan is to cycle 3 training weeks 1 deload in one month blocks. The blocks are a shift in focus ie the focus will get 2x days/week and priority on rest but other stuff will still be trained. 

Q1: Does the following month by month plan seem reasonable?

* Feb: Strength 
* march: strength
* April:  Anaerobic endurance (hopefully send some outdoor boulders)
* May: Strength 
* June: Strength
* July: Anaerobic endurance 
* August: Aerobic Endurance 
* Sept: Aerobic Endurance (send sport project) 

Q2: For the sake of time just looking for feedback on the strength week by week plans.   

Sessions to include in a strength week.

* 1x limit boulder - really short boulders, or just work sections of harder things. Aim for climbs to take multiple sessions to send. To be done on the kilter or tension board.
* 1x Session boulders - between flash and 4 attempts to send. 
* 2x Hang boarding - Exact thing TBD but low volume high intensity
* 2/3x weight lifting full body strength focus. Bench, Low-bar back squat, weighted pull-ups +some accessories. 3-5 reps on compounds 8-12reps on accessories.
* Other: Ill prob do 1/2x days ski touring, alpine or ice climbing but this isn't training. If weather doesn't permit i'd consider adding an easy day of arc style climbing/traversing
I released version 2.0 of BoulderBot, an App for generating new boulders on your Spray Wall Hello everybody!

A couple of years ago I posted a few threads about BoulderBot, an App I created for Spray/Home Walls that lets you generate new boulders using a Procedural Generation algorithm. I am happy to announce that version 2.0 of the App is now available!

The App works by asking users information about their own wall, requesting an image and all the other necessary attributes (height, angle, position and relative difficulty of the holds). The initial setup takes 5-10 minutes, after which all other functionality (generating new boulders, setting new ones manually, saving, filtering and searching them) is instantaneous and requires no extra setup.

The generation algorithm is still in development and does not match the quality of human setters, but it excels at generating novel boulders that can greatly improve the variety on your Wall. Even if a generated problem is not perfect, it can be edited and tweaked instantly.

Version 2.0 features a redesigned User Interface with improvements across the board. This release is just a starting point, as I am working on other large improvements planned for 2025, including advanced generation models (with much higher accuracy and automatic grading) and support for variable angle and mirrored walls.

In case anybody is interested, it can be installed by searching "boulderbot" in the App Store/Google Play or by opening the direct links in the website:

[https://boulderbot.io](https://boulderbot.io)

Any feedback is welcome!

My experience with the Lattice Performance Coaching plan Hey all, I'm writing up this review in hopes that my experience can help others decide on if this sort of coaching plan is the right fit for them. I've been paying for the coaching plan for ~9 months now and feel like I have enough experience worth sharing.

I'll do my best to keep the details brief and succinct, if you're looking for a **TL;DR** scroll to the bottom of this post. This review is entirely my own words, no one asked me to write this.

### Preface:

* The [performance training plan](https://latticetraining.com/product/performance-training-plan/?srsltid=AfmBOopZXINHMwzsttTiMAImrMNrHFwuqIgneuT5phx-lk3z3E3t6nkK) is Lattice's customized coaching plan. With this plan you're given a coach with whom you can discuss your goals with 1-1 and have a plan built and maintained for you based on your schedule.
* The monthly price is **$165.00**, Lattice also asks you to make a 6-month commitment to the plan before re-evaluating.
* This review is **not** about the [lattice self-coaching plans](https://latticetraining.com/product/sport-climbing-training-plan/), which have one-time payments and no on-going coach support

### About me

* I'm 29 years old
* I've been sport climbing for ~10 years now
* I live in an area with year-round outdoor climbing
* I work full time at a desk job, part time on a side-project (~50 hours/week)
* I travel fairly often for non-climbing related reasons (work/leisure/family)
* Before this plan, my hardest sport climbing grade was 7c+ (5.13a)

**Why did I decide to try Lattice's coaching plan?** Well, the beginning of this year marked my third year plateaued at 7c+ , I felt stuck and listless at the gym. I'd summarize my state of mind as such:

* I no longer felt like my accumulated training knowledge was helping me progress.
* I no longer had the interest/time to _continue_ accumulating training knowledge.
* I _really_ wanted to send 8a in 2024, and I had a line in mind that I wanted to send.

I was enjoying climbing more than ever, but I felt burnt out with respect to progressing my training. I didn't have the drive to self-study training like I used to and I didn't feel confident I could break out of the plateau myself.

### Lattice's onboarding experience

I signed up for the plan and began in March 2024. Lattice had me fill out a detailed form covering every aspect of my climbing, from my background to my sleep & nutrition. I was matched up with a coach and we discussed my goals.

Lattice uses their own training app which gives you a DM with your coach and a week-by-week scheduling feature. Your coach assigns you a number of sessions for the week and you use the app to schedule yourself what days you want to complete certain sessions.

I told my coach about my specific 8a goal and sent over an [unlisted playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVHzjcSQOe4RouJZ01zJ6bHCKVqIytsQx&si=KEOosMio2XtQzB0R) of all my recorded attempts on the line to date. My target was the fall season, I had a number of trips between then and the fall that would disrupt any standard training plan.

Before receiving my plan I also performed a remote assessment and scored well below the median for climbers at my same grade. Basically, I was weak as shit and punching above my grade.

### Initial impressions.

Shortly after submitting my assessment I received my training plan with a video recording from my coach explaining the thought process. The plan was a 12 week block-based plan, each block was four weeks and aimed at me feeling my best come the fall.

I followed the training plan pretty closely, completing on average between 85-100% of the sessions assigned to me each week. Overall I'd summarize my thoughts going into the fall season below:

**The good:**

* I _really_ liked the Lattice training app. My coach would assign me 5-6 training activities to complete each week, then I had the flexibility to slot them where I wanted to based on my own schedule.
* Having the coach available by DM in-app was great. When I got sick/busy, I'd shoot my coach and heads up and they'd adjust my plan for me, they prioritized sessions for me and never made me feel bad for having to adjust the volume on certain weeks.
* My coach was always willing to swap out certain sessions I found difficult to complete based on the available training area in my gym.

**The bad:**

* \*\*[1] \*\*[2] My coach never ended up watching my unlisted playlist 😔 -- it remained at zero views throughout my time with that coach. This made me skeptical that I was in fact receiving a custom plan. I felt disappointed that my coach seemingly did not factor in my **primary** goal for purchasing the plan to begin with.


\*\*[1]: Midway through my coaching I received a new coach. This coach immediately setup a call with me to discuss my goals. During the call this new coach pulled up my videos and watched them unprompted by me. We talked strategy and he commented on the style of the climb, this really reassured me of my concerns and I've found this new coach amazing to work with.

\*\*[2]: One could easily make the argument that it _didn't matter_ what style my project was, my coach likely knew where I needed to focus. I think my main frustration came down to the fact that they never watched the videos I sent over.

### Results

It's december now, so how'd it go for me?

* [I sent my 8a project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ejdDe3Tio&ab_channel=Syntaf) in the beginning of the season, much faster than I'd expected!
* I'm consistently redpointing lines in one or two sessions that would have previously taken me many many sessions.
* I'm spending _less_ time in the gym, but I feel stronger than ever because my gym sessions have better focus.

Overall, I can't deny that the training plan worked for me. Could I have achieved the same results here through my own means? Probably. Do I feel like I got my money's worth from a personal coach? Definitely.

### TL;DR & Final Thoughts


* I really enjoy the technology Lattice has integrated into their training plans, i.e. the app, assessments, etc.. etc.. 
* What coach you're assigned will likely heavily influence your experience. I enjoyed both my coaches but definitely prefer my latter coach, as they are much more involved in hearing from me.
* You should have a good idea of your training limits going into this so you can help your coach properly plan your week-over-week volume of training.
* I think the personalized training plan _is_ a good pick for you if:

  * You're an experienced climber stuck at a plateau.
  * You have a goal that you can clearly communicate to your coach
  * You're weaker on average compared to your peers.
  * You don't have the time or interest to manage your own plan
  * You have frequent interruptions that make following pre-built plans difficult.

* I think the personalized training plan _is not_ a good pick for you if:

  * You're relatively inexperienced or are already far stronger than your peers.
  * You don't have the disposable income to pay someone else $165/mo
  * You have the time/interest in learning how to build and maintain your own plan

From Chronic Finger Injuries to No Injuries and Breaking a Plateau TLDR: I started training using the Rock Prodigy program when my first kid was borrn because I didn't want to think about training. I had been getting at least two finger injuries every year for the last six years, but with this plan I completely stopped getting them. I mostly attribute this to taking two full rest days between sessions.

Feel free to ask questions. I'll do my best to give good answers. I might be a bit slow but I'll get to everything.

Since about 2017 I've had a ridiculous number of finger injuries:

* 2018 left middle pip tweak from campusing and then made way way worse trying High Plains Drifter
* 2019-2020 stepped way back from climbing to hopefully give the injury time to heal (didn't help)
* 2020 started working with Tyler Nelson and mostly resolved this injury, but I had taken so much time away that I went from 5.12+ climbing to struggling up 5.9
* 2021 tweaking a different finger doing my first 5.12 back from the other injury
* 2022 tweaked two fingers this year and the old 2018 injury was acting up again
* 2023 worked with Lattice on a performance plan hoping to avoid injury and get stronger. Got two bad finger tweaks and then ruptured a pulley in the fall.
* 2024 recovered the rupture but got another bad tweak in the spring

About that time I stopped working with Lattice because I was getting weaker, injured, and my first kid was about to be born. I switched over to the Rock Prodigy program by the Anderson brothers because I had never given it an honest effort before and I just really didn't want to think about my training. So I basically just did a canned program of theirs. I was extremely strict with following it and not making my own modifications based on what I thought was good. If they could go from 5.10/11 to 5.14+ on it, it was probably fine for me.

**Rock Climber's Training Manual / Rock Prodigy Training Plan** It occurs to me that this isn't common knowledge anymore, so I'll give a brief overview of the plan. This plan was published in the book "The Rock Climber's Training Manual" by Mark and Mike Anderson. It's a linear periodization plan with distinct phases of focus working toward a performance peak at the end of the mesocycle. It's primarily intended for sport climbing and was used by the Andersons to go from 5.10/11 to 5.14+ and a whole bunch of other really impressive climbs that really only pros do, not middle aged guys with full time jobs. The phases are:

1. Base Fitness for aerobic base-- primarily arcing
2. Strength -- massive hangboard sessions emphasizing hypertrophy
3. Power -- limit bouldering and campusing
4. Power Endurance -- linked boulder circuits, route repeats, and outdoor mileage/projecting
5. Performance
6. Deload

I think the book is great (minus a few chapters like weight management and the theoretical application of the plan to bouldering) and if this sounds interesting, would encourage you to get it.

I've done 2.5 full cycles of this plan now and here are my impressions with regards to managing finger injuries.

**Base Fitness**: yeah this was not really an issue for my sad tweaky fingers, but when you get to higher volumes of arcing it is actually surprisingly intense by the end and if you're feeling tweaky you really need to be careful of the fatigue.

**Strength**:  I was extremely nervous going into this because their hangboard sessions are long and intense. The first session or two felt scary, but then taking two rest days between the sessions ensured that I was ready for the next one and by the end of this phase my fingers stopped feeling so tweaky and felt quite healthy for the first time in a long long time.

**Power:** I didn't do any campusing, so this was all limit bouldering. I went into this again nervous because I had been previously using the 2016 moonboard and it was perhaps the worst thing I've ever done to my fingers. So I got rid of it and setup a spraywall instead and had a very very successful phase. Again because of the two rest days I always felt ready for the next session and never felt unhealthy.

**Power Endurance:** Here things started to unravel a little bit. My fingers started to get tweaky and painful after a few sessions. I think what happens is the fatigue sets in and the grip starts to open up mid set and that's what causes a lot of my tweakiness. The Andersons recommend a mix of one and two rest days, but I found if I only took one rest day I tended to go down in health. Now that I'm much healthier I'm wondering if I'll be able to do a standard power endurance phase without worry of injury. I ended this phase early whenever I felt like my health was going downhill, preferring to deload and then start a new cycle with an arc phase and get my aerobic base up.

**Takeaways:**  
Overall what I noticed is that two rest days was an absolute game changer for my fingers. I haven't felt this healthy in a long long time and I'd need to do a retest, but I think I'm stronger than I've ever been. I wish I had some dope project I've wrapped up that I could point to (other than the boulders on my spray wall), but I ran out of time this fall to put the lid on a few things. Hopefully they'll go down in the spring.

I've started to make minor tweaks to the training plan to fit me better, but I can't imagine not doing two rest days anymore. It takes a lot of patience, and I obviously don't just start exploding if I don't do two rest days, but the fact that I climbed hard in the fall with no new injuries was insane to me.

I think this has turned into a ramble (I don't feel bad because of the tldr at the top), but I thought with the Emil stuff coming out folks would appreciate a different anecdote on how someone's fingers started feeling better than ever (for the record I've tried abrahangs a few times over the years and have always felt worse when I'm doing them. idk maybe I'm just doing them wrong because I'm an idiot).

Feel free to ask questions. I'll do my best to give good answers. I might be a bit slow but I'll get to everything.

Also, if you've got good ideas on how to modify RCTM plan to make it better, I'd love to hear it. This cycle I'm doing arc and bouldering as a warmup for all sessions. Just a small tweak.
Active vs Passive tension The question of the difference between passive and active tension was raised yesterday with respect to a video by Loi about finger training. This post is to clarify what I think is meant by those terms, how they're different, and how they're trained.

First, a physics class....

Force is developed by the forearms, transmitted by tendons through the structure of the hand/wrist, and applied through the finger tips. This can be simplified to a physics problem similar to [this diagram](https://www.phyley.com/images/page/two-masses-on-pulley/1200x1200.png). There are forces at your finger tips, and forces at your muscle, in between is a high friction pulley. Referring to the diagram, let M be the force produced at the muscle, and m be the load at your finger tips, and f is the friction between the two. If M > m+f, then M accelerates downwards; you are overcoming the load (active tension). If M+f<m, M accelerates upwards; you are yielding to the load; form slowly failing (passive tension). If M is between m+f and m-f, it is stationary.

In the climbing context, friction is very high, many people can passively hang 2x their active hang. Choosing arbitrary numbers, this means that if you're producing 100lbs of force in the muscle, the tindeq could read 66lbs for the active hang, and 132lbs for the passive hang, with the same 100lbs experienced by the muscle. Where 66lbs is the weight that you could curl from a half crimp to a closed crimp, and 132lbs is the weight that would drag you from half crimp to open crimp or chisel grip. But! in both cases, the muscle experiences 100lbs of load, and is changing contractile length (contracting and extending, respectively).

For training purposes, this means that we can theoretically (marginally?) reduce injury risk and in inflammation in the hand by training either an active concentric, or by "overgripping" the edge (artificially forcing the muscle towards the higher end of the stationary range of loads). Assuming that injury risk and inflammation are partially determined by the shear force in the DIP/PIP joints. This has no disadvantages from a strength perspective, because the muscle is still experiencing the higher load. There are limits here; I don't think it's possible for most people to actually hit an RPE 9/10 rep in an active loading situation. Finger training is a small muscle isolation exercise, which makes truly maxing out impossible. Alternatively, it's trivial to hit RPE 10 on a passive hang; load up the weight til form degrades at whatever your cutoff time is for the isometric.

Some methodologies lend themselves to active or passive gripping more than the other. IME, "Abrahangs" are easy to do actively. edge lifting is also fairly active. Whereas hangs on the hangboard can be done relatively passively, with a true 1RM being the most passive possible hang at a weight. Repeaters or long duration isometrics almost always include a long battle with yielding form, an indicator of a very passive hang. Doing concentric/eccentric reps with any kind of loading is a the most active possible grip training.

* Other thoughts and opinions:
   * To me, active vs passive is the distinction between "owning" a hold or hang, and "surviving" a hold or hang.
   * When climbing, passive strength causes movement failure in situations where you're strong enough "on paper" to do a move.
   * Some holds shapes are naturally very active or very passive. Closed crimps vs middle 2 pockets.
   * The dynamic nature of pulling (i.e. pull ups on edges) will naturally make a grip more passive as the load varies.
   * Awkward holds preferentialize active grip, ergonomic holds can be done more passively.
Questions about the Physiological Reasons we Fall Off Climbs While technique is probably the #1 contributor to why I fall of a climb, I feel various physical "indicators" of approaching fatigue. If I fall off due to exhaustion, here are the three general reasons:  
(1) - "Totally Pumped" - Blood flow is significantly occluded to forearms - feels like I can't squeeze my hand and forearms are ballooned up, commonly felt on super overhung jug hauls.   
(2) - "Physical Fatigue" - Fast release energy reserves are depleted in forearms - commonly felt after doing 4x4 boulders and I feel like I don't have the energy to keep going, but my forearms aren't "totally pumped".   
(3) - "Tendon Fatigue" - (Unsure of the physical reason why this happens, hence my question below) - if I climb a route that is crimpy but not super overhanging, I may not get pumped or physically fatigued, but my fingers start to get "sore". My forearms aren't sore or pumped, but my fingers feel sore and eventually I feel like I have less gripping power.   
  
Here's my question - does anyone understand the physiological reason why (3) occurs? Do tendons decrease in stiffness when climbing and eventually become less capable of pulling as hard? Or is (2) and (3) basically the same thing.? I feel like my tendons are the "limiting factor" when doing a climb like that but I don't understand physiologically why this is the case.

To me, this opens up more questions - whether forearm muscle strength or tendon "stiffness" can be a limiting factor when climbing. Can one climber have really strong tendons but weak forearms or visa versa? If so, how could one "test" which is limiting & how would each climbers best training plan differ?
[UPDATE] Struggling with a lifetime as a mediocre climber I put on[ the most recent episode of the Circle Up!](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5AitfJvswJLf8vf9tHcfqJ) podcast yesterday only to hear Kyra Condie discussing [this post on mediocrity](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/1gp2yuf/struggling_with_a_lifetime_as_a_mediocre_climber/) as well as [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/1gvyomx/you_have_to_try_harder_climbs_to_send_harder/) I made about a week later on trying hard boulders. Not only do I want to say that Circle Up! is excellent, but they offer some great advice in regards to both these threads. Since the mediocrity post received a fair bit of attention, I thought I'd share a little update and a couple reflections to go along with that podcast episode.

 

* Kyra spells out two types of climbers who don't climb at the level they want to or continue to increase their grade - those who are recreational/social climbers and those that are inconsistent and inefficient with training. I would say I cycle a bit between both. I know how to train when I train, but I don't always do that because of focusing on other things. I think that post I made and the responses I got forced me to accept the hard truth  about what sacrifices I am and am not willing to make for performance, which was useful.
* I made that post near the end of about a 3 month training cycle, where I was consciously sacrificing being well rested for performance during outdoor sessions in favor of sending later, and treating outdoor climbing as another part of training. Meanwhile, I was climbing with a new, very strong crew who was pushing what I could climb and I was often the only one not sending. I didn't really account for the psychological toll that would take, solidified by a session with a pro who had a similar background to me.
* I'm happy to say that training cycle paid off! A little bit after making that post, I went on the trip I'd been training for and went on an absolute spree, sending something at or near my max grade in a session almost every day, and even the week after getting back home. Ultimately, this was exactly what I wanted - not necessarily sending my hardest grade ever but being able to competently climb on lots of interesting, challenging stuff (as far as the other post I made about trying harder boulders - now I have to think that the responses I got there were right and it might be time to try some harder climbs)

 

I'd also like to push back on one specific piece of feedback I got for the sake of inspiring further conversation. I included my number of days climbing to get past automoderator requirements that kept blocking my "try harder climbs" post, and a lot of comments zeroed in on my 4-5 days on. Now, I don't think that's the right approach ALL the time, but I do think sometimes the training community over focuses on being perfectly rested for maximal effort. This thought process is borne somewhat out of the weightlifting community that has provided a lot of the science that has recently helped advance climbing training regimens, but it doesn't necessarily account for the skill element of our sport.  For me, building up great work capacity during this training block not only allowed me to feel good on my third day on during this trip, but it also allowed me to train more. No, I wasn't doing limit boulders every day, but I think I gained a ton from spending extra sessions working technique or mindset.

Anyway,  I want to thank this sub for the feedback on both those posts. It was thought provoking and helpful. Keep up the good discussion!
I don't get endurance training I'm here to admit that I don't understand endurance training. I've watched so many videos and read countless articles, but all they've done is confuse me even more. It seems like a lot of sources contradict each other or try to invent some new fancy way of training, throwing around terms like the "CARCING" thing.

I'm not a complete idiot—I know there are different energy systems, and they need to be trained in different ways. But I'm not sure if the programs prescribed by Lattice and similar companies actually achieve what they promote in their other videos.

For example, there are tons of videos with the same message: chasing the pump isn’t a sufficient way to train endurance. They claim the better approach is to do some form of arcing or low-intensity, high-volume training. But then, on the other hand, you’ll find plenty of workouts in the Lattice app, for example, that seem to do the exact opposite—building a massive pump. They’ve got double laps, fingerboard repeaters, and so on. Other popular YouTube channels, meanwhile, recommend workouts that look more like a lactate curve test, which seems to encourage getting pumped. And repeaters—well, they’ve been used by climbers for decades and are proven to work.

So, I don’t get it. Why does every video on the topic tell me *not* to get pumped? I’ve managed to climb several 8b routes without ever trying to do tons of low-intensity volume, and I know for a fact that the climbers in my crag who climb even harder don’t do that either. It doesn’t seem to matter how long the routes are—they mostly do some combination of board climbing, max hangs, and then spend time projecting their routes.

So please enlighten me—how is this low-intensity, high-volume approach supposed to fit into a normal training schedule? Do you do it year-round or just for a few weeks or months? As I said, I never see really strong climbers spending hours climbing submaximal routes without getting pumped. What I do see is people climbing routes that are submaximal but still challenging enough to make them pumped.

And honestly, I don’t see how climbing ten 7b routes is supposed to help me send an 8b. If that were true, the best way to train for hard routes would just be multipitching easy climbs all day long.

What are your thoughts? I know I rambled a lot, but what’s your approach? Do you do arcing? Do you do repeater work that gets you pumped? Do you combine the two? Or do you just train max strength indoors and rely on projecting for endurance?
No hang with resistance band Has anyone used resistance bands instead of weights to finger train at home ?

How do you think it compares to a more controlled pull with weight ?
I have made a DIY Tindeq that can connect with t'he official App Hi everyone,

Watching the price of the Tindeq, I decided to make my own affordable alternative and I think it could interesting. I used a ESP32 microcontroller to connect it with the phone, and with a bit of reverse engineering, I managed to get the Tindeq app to recognize my device as a real Tindeq.

I saw suport in the previous publication so, I will write a post explaining the steps.

P.S. This is a project I created to learn, and I'm still improving it through trial and error.
P.S.2: I'm posting this again because I'm facing with some account bug in reddit.
